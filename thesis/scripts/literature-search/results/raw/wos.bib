Title = {JupyTEP IDE as an Online Tool for Earth Observation Data Processing},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {The paper describes a new tool called JupyTEP integrated development
   environment (IDE), which is an online integrated development environment
   for earth observation data processing available in the cloud. This work
   is a result of the project entitled JupyTEP IDE-Jupyter-based IDE as an
   interactive and collaborative environment for the development of
   notebook style EO algorithms on network of exploitation platforms
   infrastructure carried out in cooperation with European Space Agency.
   The main goal of this project was to provide a universal earth
   observation data processing tool to the community. JupyTEP IDE is an
   extension of Jupyter software ecosystem with customization of existing
   components for the needs of earth observation scientists and other
   professional and non-professional users. The approach is based on
   configuration, customization, adaptation, and extension of Jupyter,
   Jupyter Hub, and Docker components on earth observation data cloud
   infrastructure in the most flexible way; integration with accessible
   libraries and earth observation data tools (sentinel application
   platform (SNAP), geospatial data abstraction library (GDAL), etc.);
   adaptation of existing web processing service (WPS)-oriented earth
   observation services. The user-oriented product is based on a
   web-related user interface in the form of extended and modified Jupyter
   user interface (frontend) with customized layout, earth observation data
   processing extension, and a set of predefined notebooks, widgets, and
   tools. The final IDE is addressed to the remote sensing experts and
   other users who intend to develop Jupyter notebooks with the reuse of
   embedded tools, common WPS interfaces, and existing notebooks. The paper
   describes the background of the system, its architecture, and possible
   use cases.},

Abstract = {When faced with the need for documentation, examples, bug fixes, error
   descriptions, code snippets, workarounds, templates, patterns, or
   advice, software developers frequently turn to their web browser. Web
   resources both organized and authoritative as well as informal and
   community-driven are heavily used by developers. The time and attention
   devoted to finding (or re-finding) and navigating these sites is
   significant. We present Codetrail, a system that demonstrates how the
   developer's use of web resources can be improved by connecting the
   Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE) and the Firefox web
   browser. Codetrail uses a communication channel and shared data model
   between these applications to implement a variety of integrative tools.
   By combining information previously available only to the IDE or the web
   browser alone (such as editing history, code contents, and recent
   browsing), Codetrail can automate previously manual tasks and enable new
   interactions that exploit the marriage of data and functionality from
   Firefox and Eclipse. just as the IDE will change the contents of
   peripheral views to focus on the particular code or task with which the
   developer is engaged, so, too, the web browser can be focused on the
   developer's current context and task. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Watcher: Cloud-Based Coding Activity Tracker for Fair Evaluation of
   Programming Assignments},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Online learning has made it possible to attend programming classes
   regardless of the constraint that all students should be gathered in a
   classroom. However, it has also made it easier for students to cheat on
   assignments. Therefore, we need a system to deal with cheating on
   assignments. This study presents a Watcher system, an automated
   cloud-based software platform for impartial and convenient online
   programming hands-on education. The primary features of Watcher are as
   follows. First, Watcher offers a web-based integrated development
   environment (Web-IDE) that allows students to start programming
   immediately without the need for additional installation and
   configuration. Second, Watcher collects and monitors the coding activity
   of students automatically in real-time. As Watcher provides the history
   of the coding activity to instructors in log files, the instructors can
   investigate suspicious coding activities such as plagiarism, even for a
   short source code. Third, Watcher provides facilities to remotely manage
   and evaluate students' hands-on programming assignments. We evaluated
   Watcher in a Unix system programming class for 96 students. The results
   showed that Watcher improves the quality of the coding experience for
   students through Web-IDE, and it offers instructors valuable data that
   can be used to analyze the various coding activities of individual
   students.},

Abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the state of the art technologies for
   software development in cloud environments. The surveyed systems cover
   the whole spectrum of cloud-based development including integrated
   programming environments, code repositories, software modeling,

   orchestration. In this work we evaluate the existing cloud development
   ecosystem based on a wide number of characteristics like applicability
   (e.g. programming and database technologies supported), productivity
   enhancement (e.g. editor capabilities, debugging tools), support for
   collaboration (e.g. repository functionality, version control) and
   post-development application hosting and we compare the surveyed
   systems. The conducted survey proves that software engineering in the
   cloud era has made its initial steps showing potential to provide
   concrete implementation and execution environments for cloud-based
   applications. However, a number of important challenges need to be
   addressed for this approach to be viable. These challenges are discussed

Abstract = {To support and accelerate the development of simulation protocols in
   atomistic modelling, we introduce an integrated development environment
   (IDE) for computational materials science called pyiron
   (http://pyiron.org). The pyiron IDE combines a web based source code
   editor, a job management system for build automation, and a hierarchical
   data management solution. The core components of the pyiron IDE are
   pyiron objects based on an abstract class, which links application
   structures such as atomistic structures, projects, jobs, simulation
   protocols and computing resources with persistent storage and an
   interactive user environment. The simulation protocols within the pyiron
   IDE are constructed using the Python programming language. To highlight
   key concepts of this tool as well as to demonstrate its ability to
   simplify the implementation and testing of simulation protocols we
   discuss two applications. In these examples we show how pyiron supports
   the whole life cycle of a typical simulation, seamlessly combines ab
   initio with empirical potential calculations, and how complex feedback
   loops can be implemented. While originally developed with focus on ab
   initio thermodynamics simulations, the concepts and implementation of
   pyiron are general thus allowing to employ it for a wide range of
   simulation topics.},

Abstract = {To increase program comprehension and overcome learning obstacles of
   Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), various visualization techniques have
   been adopted in educational OOP environments. Some provide software
   development with visual notations without source code, while others
   support programming with visual aids. Our research supports Java
   programming along with UML diagrams (class, object, and sequence) and
   dynamic execution traces of program synchronized in a web-based
   programming environment - JaguarCode. It aims to help students better
   understand the static structure and dynamic behavior of Java programs,
   as well as object-oriented design concepts. This paper reports on the
   evaluation results of JaguarCode to investigate its effectiveness and
   user satisfaction through quantitative and qualitative experiments. The
   experimental results revealed that having both static and dynamic
   visualizations did positively impact the correctness of program
   understanding and tracing problems, while the visual representations did
   affect students' understanding on the program execution of the problems
   to higher accuracy. It was also observed that students were satisfied
   with the aspects of those visualizations provided in JaguarCode.},

Abstract = {The current Web services technologies have not exploited sufficient
   semantics and approaches to dynamic service-oriented operations in open
   environments. This paper argues that such operations can be realized
   through agent-oriented interaction approaches. The key challenge is to
   develop an integration framework for the two paradigms, agent- and
   service-oriented, in a way that capitalizes on their individual
   strengths. This paper proposes the notion of agent-based Web services
   (AWS). We address several critical issues, including the appropriate
   architectural framework and the structure of its main elements
   (agent-based Web services), their meta-model, supporting technologies,
   integration method, and implementation approach. An integrated
   development environment for this framework called SOAStudio has been
   developed and tested by implementing a case study of a reverse auction

Abstract = {Entity matching (EM) refers to the problem of identifying tuple pairs in
   one or more relations that refer to the same real world entities.
   Supervised machine learning (ML) approaches, and deep learning based
   approaches in particular, typically achieve state-of-the-art matching
   results. However, these approaches require many labeled examples, in the
   form of matching and non-matching pairs, which are expensive and
   time-consuming to label.
   In this paper, we introduce Panda, a weakly supervised system
   specifically designed for EM. Panda uses the same labeling function
   abstraction as Snorkel, where labeling functions (LF) are user-provided
   programs that can generate large amounts of (somewhat noisy) labels
   quickly and cheaply, which can then be combined via a labeling model to
   generate accurate final predictions. To support users developing LFs for
   EM, Panda provides an integrated development environment (IDE) that
   lives in a modern browser architecture. Panda's IDE facilitates the
   development, debugging, and life-cycle management of LFs in the context
   of EM tasks, similar to how IDEs such as Visual Studio or Eclipse excel
   in general-purpose programming. Panda's IDE includes many novel features
   purpose-built for EM, such as smart data sampling, a builtin library of
   EM utility functions, automatically generated LFs, visual debugging of
   LFs, and finally, an EM-specific labeling model. We show in this demo
   that Panda IDE can greatly accelerate the development of high-quality EM
   solutions using weak supervision.},

Title = {An Analysis of HTML and CSS Syntax Errors in a Web Development Course},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTING EDUCATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1, SI},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Many people are first exposed to code through web development, yet
   little is known about the barriers beginners face in these formative
   experiences. In this article, we describe a study of undergraduate
   students enrolled in an introductory web development course taken by
   both computing majors and general education students. Using data
   collected during the initial weeks of the course, we investigate the
   nature of the syntax errors they make when learning HTML and CSS, and
   how they resolve them. This is accomplished through the deployment of
   openHTML, a lightweight web-based code editor that logs user activity.
   Our analysis reveals that nearly all students made syntax errors that
   remained unresolved in their assessments, and that these errors
   continued weeks into the course. Approximately 20\% of these errors
   related to the relatively complex system of rules that dictates when it
   is valid for HTML elements to be nested in one another. On the other
   hand, 35\% of errors related to the relatively simple tag syntax
   determining how HTML elements are nested. We also find that validation
   played a key role in resolving errors: While the majority of unresolved
   errors were present in untested code, nearly all of the errors that were
   detected through validation were eventually corrected. We conclude with
   a discussion of our findings and their implications for computing
   education.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The range of applications of artificial intelligence (AI) that is based
   on nature-inspired metaheuristics is rapidly increasing across various
   scientific fields as it is used to solve complex engineering problems.
   This work develops a cloud evolutionary machine learning system, called
   the nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization and prediction system
   (NiMOPS) that is composed of metaheuristic AI and web modules. The
   objective of the proposed system is to provide a user-friendly web
   analytics for making efficient, effective, and accurate predictions as
   solutions to engineering problems. For the purposes of web development,
   this work connects two programming languages, which are MATLAB and Java.
   A MATLAB Compiler is used to package the system into Java Archive (JAR)
   files, which provide the core modules for the development of the NiMOPS
   website using an integrated development environment (IDE). IDE compiles
   the JAR files, and web utilities (JavaScript, CSS, Servlet, and other
   utility files) to form the response-request connection between the user
   and the server. Therefore, the web-based system does not require the
   installation of an application by the users because they can access the
   cloud computing system ubiquitously with a browser or mobile device.
   Furthermore, it has many functions, including export-import file, train
   model, optimize prediction, save model and visualize results. Several
   case studies of this system, involving classification and regression
   problems, were examined. The analytic results of using the system to
   solve classification problems revealed that the system had a fault
   diagnosis accuracy of 96.5\% and an accidental small fire accuracy of
   52.4\%. In solving regression problems, the root mean square errors were
   28.58-68.82\% better than those of previous methods. In particular, the
   proposed system performed multiple performance measures that were
   utilized in a regression analysis and were found to be more reliable
   evaluation metrics than used in elsewhere. The numerical experiments
   verified that cloud computing provides an innovative way to enable
   decision-makers to solve engineering problems.},

   different storefronts may be developed at the same time. In addition, we
   wanted to keep the completed software packages for compatibility
   checking. Instead of tuning the current program setting to a desired
   mixed-version environment for each project, we generate a dedicated
   workspace by applying dependency analysis. New icons are created to
   conveniently invoke the development tool under different software

   environment, this paper proposes a deep learning (D-L)-based track
   signal IDe method in the cloud edge collaborative computing environment.
   First, the main framework of the IDe method is constructed by
   comprehensively considering the backbone network, network transmission
   and ground equipment, and edge computing (EC) is introduced to cloud
   services. Then, the The CNN (Convolutional Neural
   Networks)-attention-based BiLSTM (Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory)
   neural network is used in the cloud center layer of the system to train
   the historical data, a D-L method is proposed. Finally, a pooling layer
   and a dropout layer are introduced into the model to effectively prevent
   the overfitting of the model and achieve accurate detection of track
   signal intrusion. The purpose of introducing the pooling layer is to
   accelerate the model convergence, remove the redundancy and reduce the
   feature dimension, and the purpose of introducing the dropout layer is
   to prevent the overfitting of the model. Through simulation experiments,
   the proposed IDe method and the other three methods are compared and
   analyzed under the same conditions. The results show that the F1 value
   of the method proposed in this paper is optimal under four different
   types of sample data. The F1 value is the lowest of 0.948 and the
   highest of 0.963. The performance of the algorithm is better than the
   other three comparison algorithms. The method proposed in this paper is
   important for solving the IDe signal in the cloud-edge cooperative
   environment, and also provides a theoretical basis for tracking the
   signal IDe direction.},

Abstract = {Monitoring developers' activity in the Integrated Development
   Environment (IDE) and, in general, in their working environment, can be
   useful to provide context to recommender systems, and, in perspective,
   to develop smarter IDEs. This paper reports results of a long (about
   1000 h) observational study conducted in an industrial environment, in
   which we captured developers' interaction with the IDE, with various
   applications available in their workstation, and related them with
   activities performed on source code files. Specifically, the study
   involved six developers working on three software systems and
   investigated (i) how much time developers spent on various activities
   and how they shift from one activity to another (ii) how developers
   navigate through the software architecture during their task, and (iii)
   how the complexity and readability of source code may trigger further
   actions, such as requests for help or browsing/changing other files.
   Results of our study suggest that: (i) not surprisingly, developers
   spend most or their time (similar to 61\%) in development activities
   while the usage of online help is limited (2\%) but intensive in
   specific development sessions; (ii) developers often execute the system
   under development after working on code, likely to verify the effect of
   applied changes on the system's behaviour; (iii) while working on files
   having a high complexity, developers tend to more frequently execute the
   system as well as to use more online help websites. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) can be enhanced with the so-called
   learning-by-doing, designing the courses in a way that the learners are
   involved in a more active way in the learning process. Within the
   options for increasing learners' interaction in MOOCs, it is possible to
   integrate (third-party) external tools as part of the instructional
   design of the courses. In MOOCs on computer sciences, there are, for
   example, web-based Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) which can
   be integrated and that allow learners to do programming tasks directly
   in their browsers without installing desktop software. This work focuses
   on analyzing the effect on learners' engagement and behavior of
   integrating a third-party web-based IDE, Codeboard, in three MOOCs on
   Java programming with the purpose of promoting learning-by-doing
   (learning by coding in this case). In order to measure learners' level
   of engagement and behavior, data was collected from Codeboard on the
   number of compilations, executions and code generated, and compared
   between learners who registered in Codeboard to save and keep a record
   of their projects (registered learners) and learners who did not
   register in Codeboard and did not have access to these extra features
   (anonymous learners). The results show that learners who registered in
   Codeboard were more engaged than learners who did not register (in terms
   of number of compilations and executions), spent more time coding and
   did more changes in the base code provided by the teachers. The main
   implication of this study suggests the need for a trade-off between
   designing MOOCs that allow a very easy and anonymous access to external
   tools aimed for a more active learning, and forcing learners to give a
   step forward in terms of commitment in exchange for benefitting from
   additional features of the external tool used.},

Abstract = {This paper presents COMFIT (Cloud and Model based IDE for the Internet
   of Things), a development environment for the Internet of Things that
   was built grounded on the paradigms of model driven development and
   cloud computing. COMFIT is composed of two different modules: (1) the
   App Development Module, a model-driven architecture (MDA)
   infrastructure, and (2) the App Management and Execution Module, a
   module that contains cloud-based web interface connected to a server
   hosted in the cloud with compilers and simulators for developing
   Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The App Development Module allows
   the developers to design loT applications using high abstraction
   artifacts (models), which are tailored to either the application
   perspective or the network perspective, thus creating a separation
   between these two concerns. As models can be automatically transformed
   into code through the App Development Module, COMFIT creates an
   environment where there is no need of additional configurations to
   properly compile or simulate the generated code, integrating the
   development lifecycle of IoT applications into a single environment
   partially hosted in the client side and partially in the cloud. In its
   current version, COMFIT supports two operating systems, namely Contiki
   and TinyOS, which are widely used in loT devices. COMFIT supports
   automatic code generation, execution of simulations, and code
   compilation of applications for these platforms with low development
   effort. Finally, COMFIT is able to interact with loT-lab, an open
   testbed for loT applications, which allows the developers to test their
   applications with different configurations without the need of using
   local loT devices. Several evaluations were performed to assess COMFIT's
   key features in terms of development effort, quality of generated code,
   and scalability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In its development of middleware, Fujitsu has faced three problems:
   increasing server operation costs, server over/under-utilization, and
   increasing labor hours for development environment construction. To
   solve these problems, Fujitsu has been working since 2008 on moving its
   software development environment to a cloud platform at its Numazu
   Software Development Cloud Center. In addition to solving the above
   problems, this transition to a cloud environment is expected to reduce
   costs by 700 million yen annually from 2011. Converting to cloud
   computing within Fujitsu itself is also seen as a way to refine the
   cloud products and services that Fujitsu offers to its customers. This
   paper describes the background to converting to cloud-based software
   development, Fujitsu's approach to this conversion, the effects of cloud
   deployment, and the expansion of services as a result of using a cloud
   platform. It also introduces the Numazu Cloud Center tour, which conveys
   cloud computing know-how through face-to-face conversations with

Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is a worldwide system of ``smart devices{''}
   that can sense and connect with their surroundings and interact with
   users and other systems. Global air pollution is one of the major
   concerns of our era. Existing monitoring systems have inferior
   precision, low sensitivity, and require laboratory analysis. Therefore,
   improved monitoring systems are needed. To overcome the problems of
   existing systems, we propose a three-phase air pollution monitoring
   system. An IoT kit was prepared using gas sensors, Arduino integrated
   development environment (IDE), and a Wi-Fi module. This kit can be
   physically placed in various cities to monitoring air pollution. The gas
   sensors gather data from air and forward the data to the Arduino IDE.
   The Arduino IDE transmits the data to the cloud via the Wi-Fi module. We
   also developed an Android application termed IoT-Mobair, so that users
   can access relevant air quality data from the cloud. If a user is
   traveling to a destination, the pollution level of the entire route is
   predicted, and a warning is displayed if the pollution level is too
   high. The proposed system is analogous to Google traffic or the
   navigation application of Google Maps. Furthermore, air quality data can
   be used to predict future air quality index (AQI) levels.},

Abstract = {Component-based software has become an important alternative for
   building applications, especially distributed ones, so it is essential
   to define new software development processes based on components. Within
   this trend, we propose a complete framework-based method which guides
   application developers in exactly determining application requirements.
   It also guides how to build them using the compositional framework
   MultiTEL from the collaborative and multimedia applications domain.
   Although many multimedia frameworks are available, none of them offer a
   design methodology for understanding and adapting the framework classes
   or components to each derived application. By applying an architecture
   description language (ADL) we are able to document the framework and
   help designers in: constructing; reusing, and connecting components;
   extending the framework architecture; and adding components to meet user
   requirements. Tools for the automatic generation of code from the ADL
   specifications are also described. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {The R programming language is approaching its 30th birthday, and in the
   last three decades it has achieved a prominent role in statistics,
   bioinformatics, and data science in general. It currently ranks among
   the top 10 most popular languages worldwide, and its community has
   produced tens of thousands of extensions and packages, with scopes
   ranging from machine learning to transcriptome data analysis. In this
   review, we provide an historical chronicle of how R became what it is
   today, describing all its current features and capabilities. We also
   illustrate the major tools of R, such as the current R editors and
   integrated development environments (IDEs), the R Shiny web server, the
   R methods for machine learning, and its relationship with other
   programming languages. We also discuss the role of R in science in
   general as a driver for reproducibility. Overall, we hope to provide
   both a complete snapshot of R today and a practical compendium of the
   major features and applications of this programming language.},

Title = {Securing medical data by role-based user policy with partially

Journal = {SOFT COMPUTING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {559-568},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Cloud technology provides services for storing and accessing a large
   amount of data with ease of access and less cost. Sensitive data such as
   patients' electronic health information should be encrypted before
   outsourcing into the cloud. Many traditional encryption methods are used
   for protecting data in the cloud, but unable to perform computation on
   encrypted data. Homomorphic encryption operates directly on the
   ciphertext. In this study, a Secure Partially Homomorphic Encryption
   (SPHE) algorithm is proposed to secure the outsourced data and perform
   multiplication and division operations on the ciphertext. The access
   control policy in the cloud environment is more flexible. An attacker
   can easily collect sensitive data by abusing the access policy of
   another user. Therefore, the database privacy is compromised. Creating a
   role hierarchy and managing the session is difficult in the cloud
   environment. The above issues motivate us to develop a model which is
   the integration of the proposed scheme SPHE with role-based user policy.
   The model is implemented in Eclipse IDE (Integrated Development
   Environment) and AWS (Amazon Web Service) Toolkit for Eclipse and
   deployed in Amazon Elastic Beanstalk (EB) environment. This model is
   particularly used for securing the patient e-health details and
   performing computation on outsourced data. The patient details are
   encrypted by the algorithm SPHE and uploaded in AWS S3 (Simple Storage
   Service) bucket. The users are created by AWS Identity and Access
   Management (IAM) service and the access level policy is defined based on
   user roles in EB environment. The proposed model performance is studied
   by comparing with other partially homomorphic methods Elgamal, Pailler,
   and Benaloh. This model achieves data integrity and data confidentiality
   using the role-based user policy with SPHE.},

Abstract = {Remote robotics laboratories have been successfully used for engineering
   education. However, few of them use mobile robots to to teach computer
   science. This article describes a mobile robot Control and Programming
   Environment (CPE) and its pedagogical applications. The system comprises
   a remote laboratory for robotics, an online programming tool, and a
   virtual learning environment. It allows experiments with a mobile robot
   to be carried out, tested and validated remotely, using a simple graphic
   interface via web browser, without additional software installation on
   the user's computer. Students can control and manipulate the robot with
   simple commands without worrying about hardware details or use C/C++
   programming language to develop complex programs. The robot has been
   built with inexpensive components and has sensors that enable its use in
   several experiments. CPE can be used in contextualized teaching in
   various subjects of computer science, both in class and at distance. A
   practical application of the whole system using CPE, introducing
   programming concepts, is also described in this paper. The initial
   assessment of the environment as an educational tool shows high levels
   of interest among our students, an improvement in their academic scores,
   and potential for application in the context of computing education,

Abstract = {Extreme Programming (XP) is an Agile Methodology (AM) which does not
   require any specific supporting tool for being successfully applied.
   Despite this starting observation, there are many reasons leading a XP
   team to adopt Web based tools to support XP practices. For example, such
   tools could be useful for process and product data collection and
   analysis or for supporting distributed development. In this article, we
   describe XPSuite, a tool composed of two parts: XPSwiki, a tool for
   managing XP projects and XP4IDE, a plug-in for integrating XPSwiki with
   an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Moreover, we will show how
   the full Object Oriented implementation provides a powerful support for
   extracting all data represented in the model that the system implements.

Abstract = {Thanks to the availability of various mobile applications, lots of users
   shift from desktop environments, e.g., PCs and laptops, to mobile
   devices, e.g., smartphones and tablets. However, there are still some
   desktop applications without counterparts on mobile devices, such as
   some integrated development environments (e.g., eclipse) and automatic
   industry control systems. In this paper, we propose Modeap, a
   platform-independent mobile cloud service that can push all desktop
   applications developed for various operating systems from cloud servers
   to mobile devices. Modeap follows a design principle of complete
   detachment and regeneration of desktop user interface, i.e., the
   essential graphical primitives of the original desktop applications will
   be intercepted and then translated into standard web-based graphical
   primitives such that the interactions between users and remote cloud
   applications become possible via mobile web browsers. In this way, all
   desktop applications built upon the same set of graphical primitives can
   be used on mobile devices in great flexibility without installing any
   new software. We have developed a proof-of-concept prototype that
   provides Windows applications from cloud server to mobile web browsers.
   The results of extensive experiments show that the proposed framework
   can achieve our design goals with low latency and bandwidth consumption.},

   platforms to produce the same results as face-to-face evaluations. We
   applied the proposed framework in the evaluation of a web-based

Abstract = {Search engine development tools have been made to allow users to build
   their own search engines. However, most of these tools have been
   designed for advanced computer users. Users without a full understanding
   of topics such as Web spidering would find these tools difficult to use
   due to different issues in terms of user interface, performance, and
   reliability. In view of these issues, we presented a tool called
   SpidersRUs to strike a balance between usability and functionality. On
   one hand, beginners should be able to operate the tool by using the
   basic functions needed to build a search engine. On the other, advanced
   users should be given the options to exert a higher level of
   customization while working on the tool. To study the interface design
   of SpidersRUs, we compared its usability and functionality from the
   users' perspective with two other development tools, namely Alkaline and
   Greenstone. in an evaluation study. Our study showed that SpidersRUs was
   preferred over the other two. particularly in areas of screen layout and
   sequence, terminology and system information. and learning to use the

Abstract = {Teaching Web development is an increasingly important and complex task
   due to multiple technologies that students have to master and implement

   It is particularly important in the learning scenarios that include
   large groups of students and computers that are not intended solely for
   teaching Web development as well. The authors of this paper find, based
   on their past experiences, that a disproportionately large amount of
   time is expended on troubleshooting infrastructure problems, and that
   collaboration amongst students is unsatisfactory. This paper presents a

Abstract = {A cloud computing paradigm has quickly developed and been applied widely
   for more than ten years. In a cloud data center, cloud service providers
   offer many kinds of cloud services, such as virtual machines (VMs), to
   users. How to achieve the optimized allocation of VMs for users to
   satisfy the requirements of both users and providers is an important
   problem. To make full use of VMs for providers and ensure low makespan
   of user tasks, we formulate an optimal allocation model of VMs and
   develop an improved differential evolution (IDE) method to solve this
   optimization problem, given a batch of user tasks. We compare the
   proposed method with several existing methods, such as round-robin (RR),
   min-min, and differential evolution. The experimental results show that
   it can more efficiently decrease the cost of cloud service providers
   while achieving lower makespan of user tasks than its three peers. Note
   to Practitioners-VM allocation is one of the challenging problems in
   cloud computing systems, especially when user task makespan and cost of
   cloud service providers have to be considered together. We propose an
   IDE approach to solve this problem. To show its performance, this
   article compares the commonly used methods, i.e., RR and min-min, as
   well as the classic differential evolution method. A cloud simulation
   platform called CloudSim is used to test these methods. The experimental
   results show that the proposed one can well outperform its compared
   ones, and its VM allocation results can achieve the highest satisfaction
   of both users and providers. The proposed method can be readily
   applicable to industrial cloud computing systems.},

Abstract = {Smalltalk is not only an object-oriented programming language; it is
   also known for its extensive integrated development environment
   supporting interactive and dynamic programming. While the default tools
   are adequate for browsing the code and developing applications, it is
   often cumbersome to extend the environment to support new language
   constructs or to build additional tools supporting new ways of
   navigating and presenting source code. In this paper, we present the
   OmniBrowser, a browser framework that supports the definition of
   browsers based on an explicit metamodel. With OmniBrowser a domain model
   is described in a graph and the navigation in this graph is specified in
   its associated metagraph. We present how new browsers are built from
   predefined parts and how new tools are easily described. The browser
   framework is implemented in the Squeak Smalltalk environment. This paper
   shows several concrete instantiations of the framework: a remake of the
   ubiquitous Smalltalk system browser, a coverage browser, the Duo Browser
   and the dynamic protocols browser. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The use of prototypes in requirements engineering has widely known
   benefits since they actively involve the stakeholders in the development
   process. Web Augmentation techniques make it possible to build
   prototypes relying on existing web applications. Thus, high fidelity
   mockups can be quickly generated. One of the most critical activities is
   dividing requirements into tasks and managing them through the
   development process. This paper proposes an approach that includes high
   fidelity mockups into the Task-oriented Development approach. The
   proposed approach consists of the following steps: (i) end-users
   specifies requirements, (ii) a product owner verifies and prioritizes
   the requirements, (iii) tasks are defined and included in a kanban
   board, (iv) developers should provide the functionality, and (v) the
   product owner should approved the functionality. The main contribution
   of this approach is to integrate the requirements specified through web
   augmentation mockups, into the development environment via a
   task-oriented development approach. Thus, developers will have a rich
   context that facilitates the understanding of the requirements. At the
   same time, the management of the development process will have benefits
   because of the traceability between tasks and requirements. This paper
   describes the approach proposed, called ``WAMRI{''}, and an application
   of its usage, as well as a tool to support the application.},

Abstract = {A Summary: Analysis pipelines are an essential part of bioinformatics
   research, and ad hoc pipelines are frequently created by researchers for
   prototyping and proof-of-concept purposes. However, most existing
   pipeline management system or workflow engines are too complex for rapid
   prototyping or learning the pipeline concept. A lightweight,
   user-friendly and flexible solution is thus desirable. In this study, we
   developed a new pipeline construction and maintenance tool, PipelineDog.
   This is a web-based integrated development environment with a modern web
   graphical user interface. It offers cross-platform compatibility,
   project management capabilities, code formatting and error checking
   functions and an online repository. It uses an easy-to-read/write script
   system that encourages code reuse. With the online repository, it also
   encourages sharing of pipelines, which enhances analysis reproducibility
   and accountability. For most users, PipelineDog requires no software
   installation. Overall, this web application provides a way to rapidly
   create and easily manage pipelines.},

Abstract = {Web-active end-user programmers squander much of their time foraging for

   following the information features (cues) in the environment. We
   qualitatively studied the debugging behavior of 16 web-active end users.
   Our results show that end-user programmers spend substantial amounts
   (73\%) of their time just foraging. Further, our study reveals new cue
   types and foraging strategies framed in terms of Information Foraging
   Theory, and it uncovers which of these helped end-user programmers

Title = {Reconfigurable Wireless Sensor Node Remote Laboratory Platform with
   Cloud Connectivity},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Thanks to the recent rapid technological advancement in IoT usage, there
   is a need for students to learn IoT-based concepts using a dedicated
   experimental platform. Furthermore, being forced into remote learning
   due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need for
   innovative learning methods. From our perspective, a learning platform
   should be reconfigurable to accommodate multiple applications and
   remotely accessible at any time, from anywhere, and on any connected
   device. Considering that many of the university courses are now held
   online, the reliability and scalability of the system become critical.
   This paper presents the design and development of a wireless
   configurable myRIO-based sensor node that connects to SystemLink Cloud.
   The sensors that were used are for ambient light, temperature, and
   proximity. A graphical programming environment (G-LabVIEW) and related
   APIs were used for rapid concept-to-development process. Distinct
   applications have been developed for the instructor and students,
   respectively. The students can select which sensor and application to
   run on the system and observe the measurements on the local student's
   application or the cloud platform at a specific moment. They can also
   read the data on the cloud platform and use them in their LabVIEW
   application. In the context of remote education, we strongly believe
   that this platform is and will be suitable for the COVID and Post-COVID
   eras as well because it creates a much better remote laboratory
   experience for students. In conclusion, the system that was developed is
   innovative because it is software reconfigurable from the device, from
   the instructor's application and cloud via a web browser, it is
   intuitive, and it has a user-friendly interface. It meets most of the
   necessary requirements in the current era, being also highly available
   and scalable in the cloud.},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to the solution of several open problems with

   In such scenarios, information gathered by the compiler and the
   compiler's reasoning are presented to the user in meaningful ways and
   on-demand. Second, a tight integration of compilation and performance
   analysis tools is advocated. Many of the existing, advanced instruments
   for gathering performance results are being used in the presented
   environment and their results are combined in integrated views with
   compiler information and data from other tools. Initial instruments that
   assist users in ``data mining{''} this information are presented and the
   need for much stronger facilities is explained. The URSA Family provides
   two tools addressing these issues. URSA MINOR supports a group of users
   at a specific site, such as a research or development project. URSA
   MAJOR complements this tool by making available the gathered results to
   the user community at large via the World-wide Web. This paper presents
   objectives, functionality, experience, and next development steps of the
   URSA tool family. Two case studies are presented that illustrate the use
   of the tools for developing and studying parallel applications and for
   evaluating parallelizing compilers.},

Abstract = {Providing walking assistance for mild hemiplegia patients with lower
   limb rehabilitation exoskeleton has gained considerable attention. The
   patients' motion characteristics should be emphasized, meanwhile the
   planning gait should always maintain the balance ability in the walking
   procedure. In this paper, an online balance gait generation strategy is
   proposed for an exoskeleton used in lower limb rehabilitation. In the
   present research, the online gait generation strategy is explained and
   consists of a gait planning and a gait control strategy. In the gait
   planning strategy, the healthy swing foot trajectory has been learned,
   modelled and modified for next cycles' exoskeleton motion by applying
   improved differential evolution Adaptive Hopf (iDE AHopt) oscillators.
   Meanwhile to illustrate the human motion intention, the dynamic step
   length estimation method is utilized to estimate the step length. The
   discrete step planner determines the motion of the exoskeleton's centre
   of gravity (CoG). In the gait control strategy, the online balance gait
   regulation could regulate the exoskeleton joint reference adaptively to
   confirm the maximum zero-moment-point (ZMP) walking stability according
   to the PID controller feedback joint signal. Finally, the corresponding
   simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   strategy by verifying the gait learning rate and ZMP stability margin.},

   self-injury: a thematic analysis},
Journal = {COUNSELLING PSYCHOLOGY QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 24},
Abstract = {Growing research has examined instances of voluntarily disclosed
   nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), including how people with lived
   experience are impacted when they choose to share their NSSI with
   others. Voluntary disclosure, however, represents just one way that NSSI
   experiences become known to others; NSSI can also be discovered
   involuntarily, yet little to no research has explored the impact of
   these experiences. To understand the impact of these Involuntary
   Discovery Experiences (IDEs) the present study recruited 139 university
   students (Mage = 19.13, SD = 2.12; nfemale = 121) with lived experience
   of NSSI and who reported having a past IDE. Participants took part in an
   online study involving a series of open-ended questions concerning their
   past IDEs. A thematic analysis of their responses pointed to three
   overarching psychological impacts of IDEs: I felt Stigmatized and
   Marginalized, Things did not go well, and I No Longer felt Alone in my
   experience. These findings offer initial insights into the ways people
   with lived experience of NSSI may be impacted by IDEs and point to
   several new important research avenues. The current findings also
   suggest that clinicians may need to ask clients about any potential IDEs
   and their impact in order to best support clients who self-injure.},

Abstract = {Motivated by the complexity and difficulty of engineering time-critical
   cloud applications, we investigated the methodology and software
   workbench to provide full application life cycle support to the software
   engineer. For this purpose we present a novel high-level concept that is
   concentrated on exchanging the complex, dynamic data using OASIS TOSCA
   standard, mainly used in static contexts. This methodology enables
   specifying an application logic, provisioning, deploying, monitoring,
   and dynamical adaptation to changing conditions. It can be applied
   effectively to the interchange of dynamically changing data in order to
   maintain Quality of Service. By extending TOSCA with dynamic mapping of
   Qualify of Service and runtime attributes related to the application and
   underlying architecture we show that TOSCA can be used to exchange data
   and reconfigure on-demand compute resources whilst the application is in
   the process of design, infrastructure provisioning, runtime or
   adaptation. To demonstrate that our novel research contributions can be
   realised, we implemented SWITCH IDE, which showcases this concept
   through its development workflow which offers application and underlying
   infrastructure description, manipulation and reconfiguration of QoS and
   runtime attributes. Our approach differs in that it supports the concept
   of dynamic TOSCA by directly enabling application runtime to be
   reconfigured on the fly. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   accessible effectively to the users, as we think, it requires new
   software or environment to build and program applications. The goal of
   the user programming environment of Vega Grid is to simplify the
   programming of the grid in the same way that the Web simplified
   information sharing over the Internet. To the end, it: is easier for
   ordinary users to develop, execute, and tune applications on the grid.
   In this paper, we firstly analyse the properties and capabilities grid
   programming tools should possess; and then describe our research on
   end-user programming environment when developing Vega Grid. We are now
   going to further develop our Grid End-user Programming Environment
   Prototype.},

Abstract = {To reuse available functionality, software developers usually accomplish
   copy and pasting of the source code. Empirical evaluations have
   established this activity as a prevalent cloning activity that acts as
   the main cause of the presence of clones into the software system.
   Analysis of these software systems has revealed various frequent cloning
   patterns, mainly classified into four categories viz. templating,
   forking, customization, and exact match. There are various tools that
   deal with clones proactively within the Integrated Development
   Environments. For a tool to be effective, requires the capturing of
   developers intentions. In this paper, we attempt to identify the hidden
   intentions of the software developers behind cloning practices via an
   online industrial survey involving professional software developers.
   This work will shed a light on what computer programmers are doing while
   reusing code and why. This study uncovers various intentions, extent,
   source etc. of the copy and paste activity done by the software
   developer. The observational determinations from this survey were then
   employed to validate different cloning patterns based on the developers
   perspective. Finally, based on the survey results, the solution to these
   cloning practices is discussed. Results depicted in this paper suggest
   an incorporation of these developers behavioural inference into the
   existing IDE based clone management systems.},

Title = {Measuring Program Comprehension: A Large-Scale Field Study with
   Professionals},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {44},
Number = {10},
Pages = {951-976},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {During software development and maintenance, developers spend a
   considerable amount of time on program comprehension activities.
   Previous studies show that program comprehension takes up as much as
   half of a developer's time. However, most of these studies are performed
   in a controlled setting, or with a small number of participants, and
   investigate the program comprehension activities only within the IDEs.
   However, developers' program comprehension activities go well beyond
   their IDE interactions. In this paper, we extend our ActivitySpace
   framework to collect and analyze Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) data
   across many applications (not just the IDEs). We follow Minelli et al.'s
   approach to assign developers' activities into four categories:
   navigation, editing, comprehension, and other. We then measure the
   comprehension time by calculating the time that developers spend on
   program comprehension, e.g., inspecting console and breakpoints in IDE,
   or reading and understanding tutorials in web browsers. Using this
   approach, we can perform a more realistic investigation of program
   comprehension activities, through a field study of program comprehension
   in practice across a total of seven real projects, on 78 professional
   developers, and amounting to 3,148 working hours. Our study leverages
   interaction data that is collected across many applications by the
   developers. Our study finds that on average developers spend similar to
   58 percent of their time on program comprehension activities, and that
   they frequently use web browsers and document editors to perform program
   comprehension activities. We also investigate the impact of programming
   language, developers' experience, and project phase on the time that is
   spent on program comprehension, and we find senior developers spend
   significantly less percentages of time on program comprehension than
   junior developers. Our study also highlights the importance of several
   research directions needed to reduce program comprehension time, e.g.,
   building automatic detection and improvement of low quality code and
   documentation, construction of software-engineering-specific search
   engines, designing better IDEs that help developers navigate code and
   browse information more efficiently, etc.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Volume = {8},
Pages = {96505-96514},
Abstract = {Detecting instances of plagiarism in student homework, especially
   programming homework, is an important issue for practitioners. In the
   past decades, several tools have emerged that are able to effectively
   compare large corpora of homeworks and sort pairs by degree of
   similarity. However, those tools are available to students as well,
   allowing them to experiment and develop elaborate methods for evading
   detection. Also, such tools are unable to detect instances of \&
   x201C;external plagiarism \& x201D; where students obtained unethical
   help from sources not among other students of the same course. One way
   to battle this problem is to monitor student activity while solving
   their homeworks using a cloud-based integrated development environment
   (IDE) and detect suspicious behaviours. Each editing event in program
   source can be stored as a new commit to create a form of
   ultra-fine-grained source code repository. In this paper, the authors
   propose several new features that can be extracted from such
   repositories with the purpose of building a comprehensive profile of
   each individual developer. Machine learning techniques were used to
   detect suspicious behaviours, which allowed the authors to significantly
   improve upon the performance of more traditional plagiarism detection
   tools.},

Abstract = {Developers often require knowledge beyond the one they possess, which
   boils down to asking co-workers for help or consulting additional
   sources of information, such as Application Programming Interfaces (API)
   documentation, forums, and Q\&A websites. However, it requires time and
   energy to formulate one's problem, peruse and process the results. We
   propose a novel approach that, given a context in the Integrated
   Development Environment (IDE), automatically retrieves pertinent
   discussions from Stack Overflow, evaluates their relevance using a
   multi-faceted ranking model, and, if a given confidence threshold is
   surpassed, notifies the developer. We have implemented our approach in
   Prompter, an Eclipse plug-in. Prompter was evaluated in two empirical
   studies. The first study was aimed at evaluatingPrompter's ranking model
   and involved 33 participants. The second study was conducted with 12
   participants and aimed at evaluating Prompter's usefulness when
   supporting developers during development and maintenance tasks. Since
   Prompter uses ``volatile information{''} crawled from the web, we also
   replicated Study I after one year to assess the impact of such a
   ``volatility{''} on recommenders like Prompter. Our results indicate
   that (i) Prompter recommendations were positively evaluated in 74 \% of
   the cases on average, (ii) Prompter significantly helps developers to
   improve the correctness of their tasks by 24 \% on average, but also
   (iii) 78 \% of the provided recommendations are ``volatile{''} and can
   change at one year of distance. While Prompter revealed to be effective,
   our studies also point out issues when building recommenders based on
   information available on online forums.},

   environment, real-time chat and code mirroring, error guide messages and
   related lectures, e-learning quizzes, and learning activity analysis
   features. The system standardizes the development environment between
   the instructor and students, helps students take the initiative in
   solving errors, and enables code-oriented interactions between the
   instructor and students. It also collects data from all learning
   situations in the database. Conducting a big data analysis with the

Title = {Transformation Architecture for Multi-Layered WebApp Source Code
   Generation},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {5223-5237},
Abstract = {The evolution of Web technologies leads to software premature
   obsolescence requiring technology-independent representations to
   increase the reuse rates during the development process. They also
   require integration into service-oriented architectures to exchange
   information with different Web systems supporting runtime
   interoperability. Web Applications (WebApps) run on devices with
   different capabilities and limitations increasing the complexity of the
   development process. To address these challenges, different proposals
   have emerged to facilitate the development of WebApps, which is still an
   open research field with many challenges to address. This paper presents
   a model transformation architecture based on software standards to
   automatically generate full stack multi-layered WebApps covering
   Persistence, Service, and Presentation layers. This transformation
   architecture also generates the set of test cases to test WebApp
   business logic. The proposed transformation architecture only requires a
   UML platform-independent class model as an input to generate fully
   functional Web applications in a three-tier architecture including the
   three layers, while most proposals focus on the generation of the
   Presentation layer. In addition, this architecture employs software
   industry standards to enable an easy integration into third-party tools
   and development environments. The transformation Architecture proposed
   has been empirically validated on the case study of a fully functional
   travel management WebApp that is generated using a UML class diagram
   employing a third-party tool integrated into the same integrated
   development environment.},

Abstract = {The Internet is fast becoming the standard environment for client-server
   applications that involve multiple users. The proliferation of
   Internet-based application development tools opens new doors to
   transportation researchers who work in real-time decision support system
   development In the 1990s, one of the most important problems in advanced
   transportation management systems research was the development of better
   incident management systems. Although the incident management process
   has been well studied, the development of real-time decision support
   systems that can be used by all the involved agencies remains a
   challenging area of transportation engineering research. Existing
   incident management systems are developed on various traditional
   computing platforms, Including UNIX and Windows. However, with the
   advent of the World Wide Web and Internet-based programming tools such
   as Java, it is possible to develop platform independent decision support
   tools for the incident management agencies. Web-based support tools
   offer an invaluable opportunity to develop next-generation online
   decision support tools for real-time traffic management. The
   applicability of Web-based tools to the development of online decision
   support systems for incident management Is explored and demonstrated,
   and a prototype incident management decision support system (DSS) that
   has most of the capabilities of similar UNIX-based DSS support systems
   is developed and tested. Briefly described are the implementation and
   development of a prototype wide-area incident management system using
   Web-based tools.},

Title = {Collaborative gaming and competition for CS-STEM education using SPHERES
   Zero Robotics},

Abstract = {There is widespread investment of resources in the fields of Computer
   Science, Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (CS-STEM)
   education to improve STEM interests and skills. This paper addresses the
   goal of revolutionizing student education using collaborative gaming and
   competition, both in virtual simulation environments and on real
   hardware in space. The concept is demonstrated using the SPHERES Zero
   Robotics (ZR) Program which is a robotics programming competition. The
   robots are miniature satellites called SPHERES-an experimental test bed
   developed by the MIT SSL on the International Space Station (ISS) to
   test navigation, formation flight and control algorithms in
   microgravity. The participants compete to win a technically challenging
   game by programming their strategies into the SPHERES satellites,
   completely from a web browser. The programs are demonstrated in
   simulation, on ground hardware and then in a final competition when an
   astronaut runs the student software aboard the ISS. ZR had a pilot event
   in 2009 with 10 High School (HS) students, a nationwide pilot tournament
   in 2010 with over 200 HS students from 19 US states, a summer tournament
   in 2010 with similar to 150 middle school students and an
   open-registration tournament in 2011 with over 1000 HS students from USA
   and Europe. The influence of collaboration was investigated by (1)
   building new web infrastructure and an Integrated Development
   Environment where intensive inter-participant collaboration is possible,
   (2) designing and programming a game to solve a relevant formation
   flight problem, collaborative in nature-and (3) structuring a tournament
   such that inter-team collaboration is mandated. This paper introduces
   the ZR web tools, assesses the educational value delivered by the
   program using space and games and evaluates the utility of collaborative
   gaming within this framework. There were three types of collaborations
   as variables within matches (to achieve game objectives), inter-team
   alliances and unstructured communication on online forums. Simulation
   competition scores, website usage statistics and post-competition
   surveys are used to evaluate educational impact and the effect of
   collaboration. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {WebProtege: A collaborative ontology editor and knowledge acquisition
   tool for the Web},
Journal = {SEMANTIC WEB},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {89-99},
Abstract = {In this paper, we present WebProtege-a lightweight ontology editor and
   knowledge acquisition tool for the Web. With the wide adoption of Web
   2.0 platforms and the gradual adoption of ontologies and Semantic Web
   technologies in the real world, we need ontology-development tools that
   are better suited for the novel ways of interacting, constructing and
   consuming knowledge. Users today take Web-based content creation and
   online collaboration for granted. WebProtege integrates these features
   as part of the ontology development process itself. We tried to lower
   the entry barrier to ontology development by providing a tool that is
   accessible from any Web browser, has extensive support for
   collaboration, and a highly customizable and pluggable user interface
   that can be adapted to any level of user expertise. The declarative user
   interface enabled us to create custom knowledge-acquisition forms
   tailored for domain experts. We built WebProtege using the existing
   Protege infrastructure, which supports collaboration on the back end
   side, and the Google Web Toolkit for the front end. The generic and
   extensible infrastructure allowed us to easily deploy WebProtege in
   production settings for several projects. We present the main features
   of WebProtege and its architecture and describe briefly some of its uses
   for real-world projects. WebProtege is free and open source. An online
   demo is available at http://webprotege.stanford.edu.},

Title = {Digital trail making test-black and white: Normal vs MCI},
Journal = {APPLIED NEUROPSYCHOLOGY-ADULT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1296-1303},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {Objective
   Trail Making Test-Black and White (TMT-B\&W) was developed to assess the
   cognition of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia,
   and Alzheimer's disease. Collection and analysis of test results have
   been limited due to scoring time and efforts required from both
   administrators and patients during and after taking the test. To
   increase efficiency and reducing scoring time, a computer version
   touchscreen-based digital trail making test-black and white (dTMT-B\&W)
   was developed on Android and it was administered on MCI versus
   cognitively normal controls (NC) participants. The current study
   examines the sensitivity of newly developed computer version dTMT-B\&W
   on NC and MCI subjects.
   Method
   dTMT-B\&W was developed using MIT app inventor software, a web-based
   integrated development environment (IDE) with the Android development
   tools that are used to build fully functional applications for
   smartphones and tablets. A total of 44 participants were included,
   comprised of 22 NC and 22 MCI. The dTMT-TMT-B\&W was administered to all
   NC and MCI subjects.
   Result
   dTMT-B\&W was designed to be as consistent with the pen-paper TMT-B\&W
   (ppTMT-B\&W) where the application is a standalone installation.
   dTMT-B\&W is divided into two parts (Part-A and Part-B), in which the
   subject attempts to connect black and white numbered circles
   sequentially as quickly as possible, while still maintaining accuracy.
   Similarly, the paper-based TMT-B\&W requires the subject to connect
   black and white numbered circles in ascending order, except on a sheet
   of paper rather than a tablet. dTMT-B\&W successfully distinguished NC
   from MCI subjects.
   Conclusion
   dTMT-B\&W is an Android application that was successfully developed to
   be as consistent as possible with the original pen-paper TMT-B\&W to
   establish equal concurrent validity, with some improved features
   embedded into the design and dTMT-B\&W revealed a significant
   correlation with frontal executive function and this can help in early
   diagnosing subjects with MCI among NC subjects.},

Year = {2024},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The growing popularity of computing applications has sparked the
   interest of students in computer programming languages. Minor mistakes
   are prevalent while writing small code blocks due to the coder's lack of
   knowledge and carelessness. Instead of merely providing syntax warnings,
   it would be better to offer developers with an Integrated Development
   Environment (IDE) that can automatically correct short code blocks
   containing mistakes. This makes code composition easier and more
   time-efficient, thus improving the efficacy of large-scale development
   environments. Because Python is becoming more popular, the goal of our
   study is to enhance the efficiency of writing Python code by offering an
   automatic code-correcting approach. Furthermore, automatic program
   evaluation has been performed to assist in the debugging of small code
   blocks, which will ultimately be employed in the creation of real-time
   computer applications. The proposed technique would be useful for new
   learners who wish to create small Python code blocks for ease of writing
   and debugging on online platforms (like edX, Coursera, and Udacity). One
   of the major contributions of the project is to create an erroneous
   dataset of Python coding that contains all potential forms of probable
   syntax errors. The dataset induces variety through the use of multiple
   coding templates and is used to train deep learning models. We used the
   state-of-the-art text-to-text T5 transformer network model to
   automatically repair and evaluate the incorrect code. The outcomes of
   auto-correction are examined using the ROUGE and BLEU scores, as well as
   accuracy. The model corrects Python code with single, double, and the
   multiple number of errors with greater than 80\% accuracy. Similarly,
   the performance of the basic T5 transformer network for program
   auto-evaluation with and without mistakes has been examined, and the
   model achieves greater than 65\% accuracy in both cases. The proposed T5
   base transformer outperforms the SOTA auto-correction models in terms of
   accuracy, according to a comparison study of the proposed method with
   the earlier techniques for auto-correcting codes.},

Abstract = {Many Internet of Things (IoT) applications are emerging and evolving
   rapidly thanks to widespread open-source hardware platforms. Most of the
   high-end open-source IoT platforms include built-in peripherals, such as
   the universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter (UART), pulse width
   modulation (PWM), general purpose input output (GPIO) ports and timers,
   and have enough computation power to run embedded operating systems such
   as Linux. However, each IoT platform has its own way of configuring
   peripherals, and it is difficult for programmers or users to configure
   the same peripheral on a different platform. Although diverse
   open-source IoT platforms are widespread, the difficulty in programming
   those platforms hinders the growth of IoT applications. Therefore, we
   propose an easy and convenient way to program and configure the
   operation of each peripheral using a user-friendly Web-based software

Abstract = {The growth in the data and computation need of today's operations has
   led to technical solutions that distribute workload over several
   entities for better performance. To facilitate such a paradigm, research
   studies have been investigating efficient approaches for combining high
   performance computing in shared-memory with distributed-memory
   environments. Meanwhile, the benefits of cloud computing and its modern
   enhancements have created potentials for applications to leverage the
   powerful, ubiquitous and cheap resources of cloud infrastructures. Yet,
   a small portion of the work in this area addresses the programming
   aspects of cloud-related technologies. Despite the extensive
   improvements in the fundamental mechanisms of this realm, programming
   environments offer little support for incorporating the high performance
   mechanisms of shared-memory computing with cloud computing. This study
   proposes a solution for an unobtrusive definition and integration of
   cloud-based and shared memory parallel computing, in order to further
   simplify the application of cloud capabilities in local systems. It does
   so by implementing the proposed concepts in @PT (Annotation Parallel
   Task), a parallel-programming environment that utilizes native Java
   annotations as its language constructs. The experimental evaluations
   discussed here demonstrate that the proposed approach facilitates
   achieving the potential benefits of cloud computing for performance and
   energy consumption in local devices. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {FQN Inference in Partial Code by Prompt-tuned Language Model of Code},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Partial code usually involves non-fully-qualified type names (non-FQNs)
   and undeclared receiving objects. Resolving the FQNs of these non-FQN
   types and undeclared receiving objects (referred to as type inference)
   is the prerequisite to effective search and reuse of partial code.
   Existing dictionary-lookup based methods build a symbolic knowledge base
   of API names and code contexts, which involve significant compilation
   overhead and are sensitive to unseen API names and code context
   variations. In this article, we propose using a prompt-tuned code masked
   language model (MLM) as a neural knowledge base for type inference,
   called POME, which is lightweight and has minimal requirements on code
   compilation. Unlike the existing symbol name and context matching for
   type inference, POME infers the FQNs syntax and usage knowledge
   encapsulated in prompt-tuned code MLM through a colze-style
   fill-in-blank strategy. POME is integrated as a plug-in into web and
   integrated development environments (IDE) to assist developers in
   inferring FQNs in the real world. We systematically evaluate POME on a
   large amount of source code from GitHub and Stack Overflow, and explore
   its generalization and hybrid capability. The results validate the
   effectiveness of the POME design and its applicability for partial code
   type inference, and they can be easily extended to different programming
   languages (PL). POME can also be used to generate a PL-hybrid type
   inference model for providing a one-for-all solution. As the first of
   its kind, our neural type inference method opens the door to many
   innovative ways of using partial code.},

Abstract = {A novel backstepping controller for uncertain single-input single-output

   time-derivatives of error signals used in virtual control terms are
   directly estimated in every backstepping design steps. As a result, the
   control law has a relatively simple form. In addition, convergence of
   tracking error to a small neighborhood of origin is guaranteed
   regardless of unstructured uncertainties or unmatched disturbances in
   the controlled system. It does not require separate adaptive schemes or
   universal approximators such as neural networks or fuzzy logic systems
   adaptively tuned online to cope with system uncertainties. Simulation
   results demonstrated the simplicity and good performance of the proposed
   approximation-free controller.},

   LEARN PROGRAMMING FUNDAMENTALS},
Journal = {INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING TOOLS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {93},
Number = {1},
Pages = {135-151},
Abstract = {Programming is an important course for any IT or engineering-related
   course. However, previous research shows that students face difficulties
   in learning programming due to its abstract concepts. This study aims to
   evaluate the acceptance of a developed Integrated Development
   Environment (IDE), namely C-SOLVIS which is a web-based application that
   specifically intends to facilitate the teaching and learning of the C
   programming fundamentals in Malaysian tertiary education. The C-SOLVIS
   integrates problem-solving into a program development environment for
   the C language. The goal is to guide the users in problem-solving and
   help them write C programs based on problem-solving algorithms. The
   Rapid Application Development (RAD) Model was employed in the C-SOLVIS
   development process. Based on this model, the requirement planning phase
   was carried out through the triangulation technique by applying
   qualitative approaches comprising a literature review supported by
   semi-structured interviews, document reviews, and content validation by
   expert programming lecturers. Subsequently, the design of the
   application was accomplished through the iterative prototyping process
   which was then followed by the application construction. Then, the
   C-SOLVIS is deployed to be used by several programming lecturers to
   evaluate its usability by adopting a quantitative method using the
   System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire. The study has discovered
   several suitable techniques and designs for the problem-solving and
   program development environment. For the problem -solving environment,
   the Computational Thinking (CT) concepts were applied which were
   supported by the Input-Process-Output (IPO) Model through Scientific
   Instructions and Inquiries. Meanwhile, the program development
   environment was designed and developed based on frame -based programming
   using a set of developed Code Patterns. The C-SOLVIS evaluation using
   the SUS instrument has yielded a SUS mean score of 86.07. This score is
   interpreted by SUS as an A grade that indicates C-SOLVIS as a highly
   usable application and thus is accepted for C programming learning.
   Hence, the development process of the C-SOLVIS can be used as a
   guideline for educational software development, especially in the field
   of programming education.},

Abstract = {Although the Semantic Web data standards are established, ontology-based
   applications built on the standards are relatively limited. This is
   partly due to high learning curve and efforts demanded in building
   ontology-based Semantic Web applications. In this paper, we describe an
   ontology application management (OAM) framework that aims to simplify
   creation and adoption of ontology-based application that is based on the
   Semantic Web technology. OAM introduces an intermediate layer between
   user application and programming and development environment in order to
   support ontology-based data publishing and access, abstraction and
   interoperability. The framework focuses on providing reusable and
   configurable data and application templates, which allow the users to
   create the applications without programming skill required. Three forms
   of templates are introduced: database to ontology mapping configuration,
   recommendation rule and application templates. We describe two case
   studies that adopted the framework: activity recognition in smart home
   domain and thalassemia clinical support system, and how the framework
   was used in simplifying development in both projects. In addition, we
   provide some performance evaluation results to show that, by limiting
   expressiveness of the rule language, a specialized form of
   recommendation processor can be developed for more efficient
   performance. Some advantages and limitations of the application
   framework in ontology-based applications are also discussed.},

Abstract = {The rapid progress of the mobile internet has been promoting the

Abstract = {This paper moves a first step towards the creation of Intelligent
   Domotic Environments (IDE) in real-life home-living. A new Domotic OSGi
   Gateway (DOG) is presented, able to manage different domotic networks as
   a single, technology neutral, home automation system. The adoption of a
   standard framework such as OSGi, and of sophisticated modeling
   techniques stemming from the Semantic Web research community, allows DOG
   to go beyond simple automation and to support reasoning-based
   intelligence inside home environments. By exploiting automatic device
   generalization, syntactic and semantic command validation, and
   internet-work scenario definition, DOG provides the building blocks for
   supporting the evolution of current, isolated, home automation plants
   into IDEs, where heterogeneous devices and domotic systems are
   coordinated to behave as a single, intelligent, proactive system. The
   paper introduces the DOG architecture and the underlying ontology
   modeling. A case stud), is also illustrated, where DOG controls a
   laboratory reconstruction of a simple domotic environment.},

Abstract = {Performing online behavioral research is gaining increased popularity
   among researchers in psychological and cognitive science. However, the
   currently available methods for conducting online reaction time
   experiments are often complicated and typically require advanced
   technical skills. In this article, we introduce the Qualtrics Reaction
   Time Engine (QRTEngine), an open-source JavaScript engine that can be
   embedded in the online survey development environment Qualtrics. The
   QRTEngine can be used to easily develop browser-based online reaction
   time experiments with accurate timing within current browser
   capabilities, and it requires only minimal programming skills. After
   introducing the QRTEngine, we briefly discuss how to create and
   distribute a Stroop task. Next, we describe a study in which we
   investigated the timing accuracy of the engine under different processor
   loads using external chronometry. Finally, we show that the QRTEngine
   can be used to reproduce classic behavioral effects in three reaction
   time paradigms: a Stroop task, an attentional blink task, and a
   masked-priming task. These findings demonstrate that QRTEngine can be
   used as a tool for conducting online behavioral research even when this
   requires accurate stimulus presentation times.},

Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The increasing prevalence of renewable energy resources introduces a
   high variability that complicates the task of energy management in
   modern power grids. Among other technologies, batteries have proven
   effective in managing power imbalances in such grids. However, the high
   cost of large-scale batteries, coupled with their enormous space
   requirements, could deter their adoption by large consumers such as
   shared facility controllers. The aggregation of residential energy
   storage units offers shared facility controllers (SFCs) an alternative
   way to leverage storage; however, a secure scheme that promotes fairness
   and transparency in the selection and compensation of shared storage
   unit owners is needed. To this end, an Ethereum smart contract that
   makes residential storage capacities available to SFCs via a double
   auction mechanism is proposed. The contract is written with solidity and
   deployed in the browser-based Remix-integrated development environment.
   Scenario tests prove the effectiveness of the smart contract in
   selecting and compensating the owners of shared storage capacities,
   according to predefined auction rules.},

   Lateral Sclerosis Online Genetics Database (ALSoD)},
Journal = {JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {1},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {Background: The ALS Online Genetics Database (ALSoD) website holds
   mutation, geographical, and phenotype data on genes implicated in
   amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and links to bioinformatics
   resources, publications, and tools for analysis. On average, there are
   300 unique visits per day, suggesting a high demand from the research
   community. To enable wider access, we developed a mobile-friendly
   version of the website and a smartphone app.
   Objective: We sought to compare data traffic before and after
   implementation of a mobile version of the website to assess utility.
   Methods: We identified the most frequently viewed pages using Google
   Analytics and our in-house analytic monitoring. For these, we optimized
   the content layout of the screen, reduced image sizes, and summarized
   available information. We used the Microsoft. NET framework mobile
   detection property (HttpRequest. IsMobileDevice in the Request. Browser
   object in conjunction with HttpRequest. UserAgent), which returns a true
   value if the browser is a recognized mobile device. For app development,
   we used the Eclipse integrated development environment with Android
   plug-ins. We wrapped the mobile website version with the WebView object
   in Android. Simulators were downloaded to test and debug the
   applications.
   Results: The website automatically detects access from a mobile phone
   and redirects pages to fit the smaller screen. Because the amount of
   data stored on ALSoD is very large, the available information for
   display using smartphone access is deliberately restricted to improve
   usability. Visits to the website increased from 2231 to 2820, yielding a
   26\% increase from the pre-mobile to post-mobile period and an increase
   from 103 to 340 visits (230\%) using mobile devices (including tablets).
   The smartphone app is currently available on BlackBerry and Android
   devices and will be available shortly on iOS as well.
   Conclusions: Further development of the ALSoD website has allowed access
   through smartphones and tablets, either through the website or directly
   through a mobile app, making genetic data stored on the database readily
   accessible to researchers and patients across multiple devices.},

Abstract = {From edge devices to cloud servers, providing optimized hardware
   acceleration for specific applications has become a key approach to
   improve the efficiency of computer systems. Traditionally, many systems
   employ commercial field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to implement
   dedicated hardware accelerator as the CPU's co-processor. However,
   com-mercial FPGAs are designed in generic architectures and are provided
   in the form of discrete chips, which makes it difficult to meet
   increasingly diver-sified market needs, such as balancing reconfigurable
   hardware resources for a specific application, or to be integrated into
   a customer's system-on -a-chip (SoC) in the form of embedded FPGA
   (eFPGA). In this paper, we propose an eFPGA generation suite with
   customizable architecture and in-tegrated development environment (IDE),
   which covers the entire eFPGA design generation, testing, and
   utilization stages. For the eFPGA design generation, our intellectual
   property (IP) generation flow can explore the optimal logic cell,
   routing, and array structures for given target applica-tions. For the
   testability, we employ a previously proposed shipping test method that
   is 100\% accurate at detecting all stuck-at faults in the entire
   FPGA-IP. In addition, we propose a user-friendly and customizable Web
   -based IDE framework for the generated eFPGA based on the NODE-RED
   development framework. In the case study, we show an eFPGA architecture
   exploration example for a differential privacy encryption application
   using the proposed suite. Then we show the implementation and evaluation
   of the eFPGA prototype with a 55 nm test element group chip design.},

Abstract = {Web Applications have become an omnipresent part of our daily lives.
   They are easy to use, but hard to develop. WYSIWYG editors, form
   builders, mashup editors, and markup authoring tools ease the
   development of Web Applications. However, more advanced Web Applications
   require servers-side programming, which is beyond the skills of end-user
   developers. In this paper, we discuss how declarative languages can
   simplify Web Application development and empower end-users as Web
   developers. We first identify nine end-user Web Application development
   levels ranging from simple visual customization to advanced three-tier
   programming. Then, we propose expanding the presentation tier to support
   all aspects of Web Application development. We introduce a unified
   XForms-based framework-called XFormsDB-that supports both client-side
   and server-side Web Application development. Furthermore, we make a
   language extension proposal-called XFormsRTC-for adding true real-time
   communication capabilities to XForms. We also present XFormsDB
   Integrated Development Environment (XIDE), which assists end-users in
   authoring highly interactive data-driven Web Applications. XIDE supports
   all Web Application development levels and, especially, promotes the
   transition from markup authoring and snippet programming to single and
   unified language programming.},

Abstract = {This research explored how educators with limited programming
   experiences learned to design mobile apps through peer support and
   instructor guidance. Educators were positive about the sense of
   community in this online course. They also considered App Inventor a
   great web-based visual programming tool for developing useful and fully
   functioning mobile apps. They had great sense of empowerment through
   developing unique apps by using App Inventor. They felt their own design
   work and creative problem solving were inspired by the customized mobile
   apps shared by peers. The learning activities, including sharing
   customized apps, providing peer feedback, composing design proposals,
   and keeping design journals (blogging), complemented each other to
   support a positive sense of community and form a strong virtual
   community of learning mobile app design. This study helped reveal the
   educational value of mobile app design activities and the web-based
   visual programming tool, and the possibility of teaching/learning mobile
   app design online. The findings can also encourage educators to explore
   and experiment on the potential of incorporating these design learning
   activities in their respective settings, and to develop mobile apps for
   their diverse needs in teaching and learning.},

Abstract = {One of the main tasks of institutions of higher pedagogical education is
   the teacher training for life in the information society and for
   computer technology and software application in professional activity.
   The article reveals the conditions for choosing programming environment
   as a means of developing ICT competence of future primary school
   teachers. The analysis of Ukrainian and foreign scientists' works shows
   that block visual programming languages have significant advantages over
   the text ones at the initial stage of programming training. The groups
   of criteria that influence the choice of visual programming environment
   are defined. The availability of support for performing basic
   mathematical and logical operations, the possibility to write formulas
   in mathematical form as well as the availability and support of the
   basic algorithmic constructions refer to the group of criteria related
   to the features of the programming environment. The criteria related to
   the possibility of using the environment at the initial stage of
   programming languages training contain the simplicity and convenience of
   the interface, the availability of instructions and manuals, the
   versions of programs that can be used free of charge. The technological
   criteria include the following indicators: a crossover form, the support
   for robotic designers, the availability of mobile and online versions, a
   license type, the support and the development of the environment. The
   paper presents a comparative analysis of present-day popular visual
   programming environments by all criteria and indicators (Alice, Google
   Blockly, Kodu, Scratch, Snap!). It has been determined that according to
   the mentioned above criteria and indicators, the most expedient,
   suitable and effective visual block programming environment for the
   formation and the development of ICT competence of future primary school
   teachers, despite some certain shortcomings, is Scratch and Scratch-like

Title = {Evolution of Knowledge Management Towards Wisdom Management},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION \& KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {22},
Number = {06},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {To provide solutions to the world's global challenges, there is an
   urgent demand for wise organisations, wise leadership, wise workers, and
   most importantly, for wise actions. Since the mid-1990s, Knowledge
   Management (KM) as a discipline and practice has emerged
   internationally, and it has passed through several phases of
   development. Simultaneously, in the last four decades we have
   experienced a growth of wisdom research and intensified discourses about
   Wisdom Management (WM) as a possible venue for dealing with wicked
   problems. The dilemma is whether the current sixth phase of KM is able
   to address the global problems of the world. Therefore, this conceptual
   paper seeks to answer the question if WM will complement or replace KM.
   This paper explores the evolutionary phases of KM; it presents the
   discourses about WM, and it discovers the presence of wisdom in the KM
   literature (1995-2022). The research approach is explorative and
   inductive. Methods of Computational Social Sciences and RStudio as an
   Integrated Development Environment (IDE) are utilised for analysing,
   visualising, and interpreting the data. This paper analyses 255
   wisdom-related keywords that emerged from 39 sources written by 50
   authors. The three data analyses methods are: word cloud data analysis;
   dictionary-based data analysis, and bipartite network analysis. The
   findings are presented in word clouds; keywords frequency; bipartite
   network, and in a synthesised framework to show the similar and
   different concepts of KM and WM. The novelty value of this paper is the
   result of the bipartite network analysis that allows to identify how
   authors and wisdom-related keywords are connected with the same word
   nodes. This paper contributes to KM because it is the first study to
   explore and illustrate the presence of wisdom attributes in the KM
   literature.},

Abstract = {A Java-based system called the GcoJAVA System was introduced in {[}1].
   This system allows a user to remotely compile his/her own C/C++ programs
   and execute them for visualization among a group of remote users. DISPE,
   which stands for DIStributed Programming Environment, expands on the
   GcoJAVA System by allowing the resulting executables to be run on
   systems other than the host on which they were compiled, thus making the
   system more versatile. DISPE uses Common Object Request Broker (CORBA)
   services to enable executables compiled on this system to invoke methods
   in libraries on remote sites in an architecturally heterogeneous
   environment. Not only does this allow users to compile and execute their
   programs remotely, but the maintenance and duplication of Libraries is
   lowered since agents are used to search for symbols in libraries located
   remotely and to compile them with the user's source code, hs long as
   there is an Internet connection between the hosts on which these
   libraries reside, the agents can search and compile with these
   libraries.},

Abstract = {Defeasible reasoning is a rule-based approach for efficient reasoning
   with incomplete and inconsistent information. Such reasoning is useful
   for many applications in the Semantic Web. However, the RuleML syntax of
   defeasible logic may appear too complex for many users. Furthermore, the
   interplay between various technologies and languages, such as defeasible
   reasoning, RuleML, and RDF impose a demand for using multiple, diverse
   tools for building rule-based applications for the Semantic Web. In this
   paper we present VDR-Dcvice, a visual integrated development environment
   for developing and using defeasible logic rule bases on top of RDF
   ontologies. VDR-Device integrates in a user-friendly graphical shell, a
   visual RuleML-compliant rule editor that constrains the allowed
   vocabulary through analysis of the input RDF ontologies and a defeasible
   reasoning system that processes RDF data and RDF Schema ontologies.},

   rich clients as business applications front ends. But very often these
   applications are tied to the development tools and very hard to extend.
   We propose a clean and elegant architecture which considers a plugin
   based approach as a general solution to the extensibility problem. The
   approach is demonstrated by refactoring a simple application taken from
   a public forum into the proposed architecture including two new
   extensions that are implemented as plugins.},

Abstract = {Much of the elegance and power of Smalltalk comes from its programming
   environment and tools. First introduced more than 20 years ago, the
   Smalltalk browser enables programmers to ``home in{''} on particular
   methods using a hierarchy of manually-defined classifications. By its
   nature, this classification scheme says a lot about the desired state of
   the code, but little about the actual state of the code as it is being
   developed. We have extended the Smalltalk browser with dynamically
   computed virtual categories that dramatically improve the browser's
   support for incremental programming. We illustrate these improvements by
   example, and describe the algorithms used to compute the virtual
   categories efficiently. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   Web application, Search/SR to a new, functionally identical application,

   technology. Our results indicate that provision of easy access to
   database engines and external objects is almost essential for a
   development environment to be considered viable for rapid and robust
   application delivery. While LISP itself is a robust language, its use in
   Web applications may be hard to justify given that current vendor
   implementations do not provide such functionality. Alternative,
   currently available scripting environments for Web development appear to
   have most of LISP's advantages and few of its disadvantages. (C) 2001

   novel approach of semantics-based matchmaking, which is named
   process-context aware matchmaking. The process-context aware matchmaking
   discovers the suitable service during web service composite modeling.
   During matchmaking, the approach utilizes not only semantics of
   technical process but also that of business process of a registered
   service, thus further improving the precision of matchmaking. We
   integrate the process-context aware matchmaking, with
   business-process-driven web service composition in an integrated
   development environment based on Eclipse. The performance evaluation
   shows that performance overhead of this novel approach is acceptable.

Abstract = {We present StochSS: Stochastic Simulation as a Service, an integrated
   development environment for modeling and simulation of both
   deterministic and discrete stochastic biochemical systems in up to three
   dimensions. An easy to use graphical user interface enables researchers
   to quickly develop and simulate a biological model on a desktop or
   laptop, which can then be expanded to incorporate increasing levels of
   complexity. StochSS features state-of-the-art simulation engines. As the
   demand for computational power increases, StochSS can seamlessly scale
   computing resources in the cloud. In addition, StochSS can be deployed
   as a multi-user software environment where collaborators share
   computational resources and exchange models via a public model
   repository. We demonstrate the capabilities and ease of use of StochSS
   with an example of model development and simulation at increasing levels
   of complexity.},

Abstract = {Model Driven Engineering relies on the availability of software models
   and of development tools supporting the transition from models to code.
   The generation of code from models requires the unambiguous
   interpretation of the semantics of the modeling languages used to
   specify the application. This paper presents the formalization of the
   semantics of the Interaction Flow Modeling Language (IFML), a recent 0MG
   MDA standard conceived for the specification of the front-end part of
   interactive applications. IFML constructs are mapped to equivalent
   structures of Place Chart Nets (PCN), which allows their precise
   interpretation. The defined semantic mapping is implemented in an online
   Model-driven development environment that enables the creation and
   inspection of PCNs from IFML, the analysis of the behavior of IFML
   specifications via PCN simulation, and the generation of code for mobile
   and web-based architectures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Malaria epidemics can be triggered by fluctuations in temperature and
   precipitation that influence vector mosquitoes and the malaria parasite.
   Identifying and monitoring environmental risk factors can thus provide
   early warning of future outbreaks. Satellite Earth observations provide
   relevant measurements, but obtaining these data requires substantial
   expertise, computational resources, and internet bandwidth. To support
   malaria forecasting in Ethiopia, we developed software for Retrieving
   Environmental Analytics for Climate and Health (REACH). REACH is a
   cloud-based application for accessing data on land surface temperature,
   spectral indices, and precipitation using the Google Earth Engine (GEE)
   platform. REACH can be implemented using the GEE code editor and
   JavaScript API, as a standalone web app, or as package with the Python
   API. Users provide a date range and data for 852 districts in Ethiopia
   are automatically summarized and downloaded as tables. REACH was
   successfully used in Ethiopia to support a pilot malaria early warning
   project in the Amhara region. The software can be extended to new
   locations and modified to access other environmental datasets through
   GEE.},

Abstract = {The conventional requirements of monozukuri (manufacturing) included
   needs for high performance, miniaturization, low costs and fast

   safety. In order to respond to these changes in technologies and the
   business environment, it is essential to introduce development processes
   and a development environment that allow for effective governance of
   development overall. Fujitsu has integrated the know-how of monozukuri
   cultivated over many years, and built Flexible Technical Computing

   for designing printed circuit boards, a key component of the electrical
   design platform; a simulation environment for analyzing noise and such

   Migration},
Journal = {CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS \& CONTINUA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {74},
Number = {1},
Pages = {279-291},
Abstract = {The demand for cloud computing has increased manifold in the recent
   past. More specifically, on-demand computing has seen a rapid rise as
   organizations rely mostly on cloud service providers for their
   day-to-day computing needs. The cloud service provider fulfills
   different user requirements using virtualization - where a single
   physical machine can host multiple Virtual Machines. Each virtual
   machine potentially represents a different user environment such as
   operating system, programming environment, and applications. However,
   these cloud services use a large amount of electrical energy and produce
   greenhouse gases. To reduce the electricity cost and greenhouse gases,
   energy efficient algorithms must be designed. One specific area where
   energy efficient algorithms are required is virtual machine
   consolidation. With virtual machine consolidation, the objective is to
   utilize the minimum possible number of hosts to accommodate the required
   virtual machines, keeping in mind the service level agreement
   requirements. This research work formulates the virtual machine
   migration as an online problem and develops optimal offline and online
   algorithms for the single host virtual machine migration problem under a
   service level agreement constraint for an over-utilized host. The online
   algorithm is analyzed using a competitive analysis approach. In
   addition, an experimental analysis of the proposed algorithm on
   real-world data is conducted to showcase the improved performance of the
   proposed algorithm against the benchmark algorithms. Our proposed online
   algorithm consumed 25\% less energy and performed 43\% fewer migrations
   than the benchmark algorithms.},

Year = {2022},

Pages = {3359-3371},
Abstract = {Introduction: Cancers presenting at advanced stages inherently have poor
   prognosis. High grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most common and
   aggressive form of tubo-ovarian cancer. Clinical tests to accurately
   diagnose and monitor this condition are lacking. Hence, development of
   disease-specific tests are urgently required. Methods: The molecular
   profile of HGSC during disease progression was investigated in a unique
   patient cohort. A bespoke data browser was developed to analyse gene
   expression and DNA methylation datasets for biomarker discovery. The
   Ovarian Cancer Data Browser (OCDB) is built in C\# with a.NET framework
   using an integrated development environment of Microsoft Visual Studio
   and fast access files (.faf). The graphical user interface is easy to
   navigate between four analytical modes (gene expression; methylation;
   combined gene expression and methylation data; methylation clusters),
   with a rapid query response time. A user should first define a disease
   progression trend for prioritising results. Single or multiomics data
   are then mined to identify probes, genes and methylation clusters that
   exhibit the desired trend. A unique scoring system based on the
   percentage change in expression/methylation between disease stages is
   used. Results are filtered and ranked using weighting and
   penalties.Results: The OCDB's utility for biomarker discovery is
   demonstrated with the identified target OSR2. Trends in OSR2 repression
   and hypermethylation with HGSC disease progression were confirmed in the
   browser samples and an independent cohort using bioassays. The OSR2
   methylation biomarker could discriminate HGSC with high specificity
   (95\%) and sensitivity (93.18\%).Conclusions: The OCDB has been refined
   and validated to be an integral part of a unique biomarker discovery
   pipeline. It may also be used independently to aid identification of
   novel targets. It carries the potential to identify further biomarker
   assays that can reduce type I and II errors within clinical
   diagnostics.Crown Copyright (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V. on

Abstract = {The recent outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19) has exposed the enormous
   scope of upgradation of our current healthcare facilities. People were
   forced to isolate themselves from others mainly to break the chain of
   virus transmission within society. Unfortunately, the patients, who were
   remotely located, could not even avail of healthcare facilities due to
   insufficient logistic and workforce support. This incident had led to
   the untimely death of many covid and non-covid patients, whose lives
   could have been saved with the timely delivery of healthcare facilities.
   As a result, we have realized the importance of prompt delivery of
   healthcare services to patients through a secured and virtual medium
   like the cloud. For this purpose, the authors have proposed a Healthcare
   Integrated Development Environment, where patients may avail
   multivariate healthcare facilities using a smart card-based
   single-window interface, namely, Multipurpose Electronic Card.
   Considering the installation and maintenance cost of a cloud-based
   electronic service delivery system, it would be a better idea to
   simulate its performance to verify its output gained with reference to
   the investment of resources. To achieve this objective, in this paper,
   the authors have performed an open-source Simpy library-based simulation
   of Cloud Healthcare System using Multipurpose Electronic Card.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Many block-based programming environments have proven to be effective at
   engaging novices in learning programming. However, most offer only
   restricted access to the outside world, limiting learners to commands
   and computing resources built in to the environment. Some allow learners
   to drag and drop files, connect to sensors and robots locally or issue
   HTTP requests. But in a world where most of the applications in our
   daily lives are distributed (i.e., their functionality depends on
   communicating with other computers or accessing resources and data on
   the internet), the limited support for beginners to envision and create
   such distributed programs is a lost opportunity. We argue that it is
   feasible to create environments with simple yet powerful abstractions
   that open up distributed computing and other widely-used but advanced
   computing concepts including networking, the Internet of Things, and
   cybersecurity to novices. The paper presents the architecture of and
   design decisions behind NetsBlox, a programming environment that
   supports these ideas. We show how NetsBlox expands opportunities for
   learning considerably: NetsBlox projects can access a wealth of online
   data and web services, and they can communicate with other projects.
   Moreover, the tool infrastructure enables young learners to collaborate
   with each other during program construction, whether they share their
   physical location or study remotely. Importantly, providing access to
   the wider world will also help counter widespread student perceptions
   that block-based environments are mere toys, and show that they are
   capable of creating compelling applications. In this way, NetsBlox
   offers an illuminating example of how tools can be designed to
   democratize access to powerful ideas in computing.},

Title = {A visual programming tool for mobile web augmentation},
Journal = {KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 23},
Abstract = {The use of mobile devices for web browsing has increased extraordinarily
   in recent years, becoming the main source of information. Unfortunately,
   developers cannot meet the needs of all users. As a result, users have
   been forced to adapt web content to their needs. Additionally, users
   face more costly interactions than on desktop computers due to the
   smaller screen size of cell phones. These interactions include URL
   typing, scrolling, taping, branching and tab-switching. If the number of
   web resources is large, the activity becomes unpleasant. Furthermore,
   should the quantity of interactions be extensive, the web experience
   also becomes unpleasant. Moreover, all these interactions lead to higher
   costs in terms of phone time and battery life, as well as more costly
   navigation. Web augmentation enhances the user web experience by adding
   content from different resources, modifying the original layout, or
   reducing interactions during web searches, among other benefits. To
   reduce user interactions and satisfy their information necessities, we
   propose MAWA, an extension for Firefox mobile that allows users to adapt
   any web page to their needs through web augmentation techniques. To
   validate our proposal, an evaluation of the tool has been carried out.
   The article presents the benefits introduced by MAWA as a response to
   the inconveniences experienced by users when performing their activities
   in the mobile browser. The results obtained show that MAWA is able to
   reduce the number of interactions significantly, as well as to reduce
   battery consumption and the time needed to obtain the desired
   information. In addition, users perceive that navigation is less
   cluttered.},

Abstract = {Cloud computing has become one of the leading technologies in the world
   today. The benefits of cloud computing affect end users directly. There
   are several cloud computing frameworks, and each has ways of monitoring
   and providing resources. Cloud computing eliminates customer
   requirements such as expensive system configuration and massive
   infrastructure while improving dependability and scalability. From the
   user's perspective, cloud computing makes it easy to upload multiagents
   and operate on different web services. In this paper, the authors used a
   restful web service and an agent system to discuss, deployments, and
   analysis of load performance parameters like memory use, cen-tral
   processing unit (CPU) utilization, network latency, etc., both on
   localhost and an Amazon Web Service Elastic Cloud Computing (AWS-EC2)
   server. The Java Agent Development Environment (JADE) tool has been used
   to propose an archi-tecture and conduct a comparative study on both
   local and remote servers. JADE is an open-source tool for maintaining
   applications on AWS infrastructure. The focus of the study should be to
   reduce the complexity and time of load perfor-mance parameters by using
   an agent system on a cloud server instead of establish-ing a massive
   infrastructure on a local system, even for a small application.},

Abstract = {Cloud manufacturing is an emerging service-oriented model to solve
   existing problems in manufacturing. This study proposes a process
   calculus-based approach to formally model cloud manufacturing service
   composition that is composed of description model, interaction scenario
   model, and composition process formal model, in which the semantics of
   process calculus to describe the quality of service (QoS) information of
   service composition is extended, and an intelligent service composition
   method is put forward based on the extended process calculus. Then, a
   platform architecture for implementing the proposed approach is
   addressed. The integrated development environment for the platform is
   set up with selection of free software tools. Thus, a prototype of the
   platform is developed. Finally, automated guided vehicle processing
   service composition and the open integrated manufacturing system service
   composition are taken as examples to illustrate the application of the
   proposed service composition method. The main attributes of the formal
   models for the application cases are verified. Case study results show
   that the proposed service composition and formal verification method
   based on the extended process calculus is feasible. Compared with other
   approaches for service composition, the proposed intelligent service
   composition method meets the most requirements for service composition.},

Journal = {DATA \& KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {66},
Number = {1},
Pages = {116-146},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Logic is currently the target of the majority of the upcoming efforts
   towards the realization of the Semantic Web vision, namely making the
   content of the Web accessible not only to humans, as it is today, but to
   machines as well. Defeasible reasoning, a rule-based approach to
   reasoning with incomplete and conflicting information, is a powerful
   tool in many Semantic Web applications. Despite its strong mathematical
   background, logic, in general, and defeasible logic, in particular, may
   overload the user with tons of additional complex semantic relationships
   among data and metadata of the Semantic Web. To this end, a
   comprehensible, visual representation of these semantic relationships
   (rules) would help users understand them and make more use of them. This
   paper presents VDR-DEVICE, a defeasible reasoning system, designed
   specifically for the Semantic Web environment. VDR-DEVICE is an
   integrated development environment for deploying and visualizing
   defeasible logic rule bases on top of RDF Schema ontologies. The system
   consists of a number of sub-components, which, though developed
   autonomously, are combined efficiently, forming a flexible framework.
   The system employs a defeasible reasoning system that supports direct
   importing and processing of RDF data and RDF Schema ontologies as well
   as a number of user-friendly rule base and ontology visualization
   modules. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {It is not possible to directly observe how students work in an online

   students. By using an online programming environment, we have the
   opportunity to record what the students actually do to solve an
   assignment. These recordings can be analyzed to provide teachers with
   valuable information. We developed such an online programming tool with
   fine-grained event logging and used it to observe how our students solve
   problems. Our tool provides descriptive statistics and accurate replays
   of a student's programming sessions, including mouse movements. We used
   the tool in a course and collected 1028 detailed recordings. In this
   article, we compare fine-grained logging to existing coarse-grained
   logging solutions to estimate assignment-solving time. We find that time
   aggregations are improved by including time for active reading and
   navigation, both enabled by the increased granularity. We also divide
   the time users spent into editing (on average 14.8\%), active use (on
   average 37.8\%), passive use (on average 29.0\%), and estimate time used
   for breaks (on average 18.2\%). There is a correlation between
   assignment solving time for students who pass assignments early and
   students that pass later but also a case where the times differ
   significantly. Our tool can help improve computer engineering education
   by providing insights into how students solve programming assignments
   and thus enable teachers to target their teaching and/or improve
   instructions and assignments.},

Title = {TermGenie - a web-application for pattern-based ontology class
   generation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL SEMANTICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},
Month = {DEC 11},
Abstract = {Background: Biological ontologies are continually growing and improving
   from requests for new classes (terms) by biocurators. These ontology
   requests can frequently create bottlenecks in the biocuration process,
   as ontology developers struggle to keep up, while manually processing
   these requests and create classes.
   Results: TermGenie allows biocurators to generate new classes based on
   formally specified design patterns or templates. The system is web-based
   and can be accessed by any authorized curator through a web browser.
   Automated rules and reasoning engines are used to ensure validity,
   uniqueness and relationship to pre-existing classes. In the last 4 years
   the Gene Ontology TermGenie generated 4715 new classes, about 51.4\% of
   all new classes created. The immediate generation of permanent
   identifiers proved not to be an issue with only 70 (1.4\%) obsoleted
   classes.
   Conclusion: TermGenie is a web-based class-generation system that
   complements traditional ontology development tools. All classes added
   through pre-defined templates are guaranteed to have OWL equivalence
   axioms that are used for automatic classification and in some cases
   inter-ontology linkage. At the same time, the system is simple and
   intuitive and can be used by most biocurators without extensive
   training.},

Abstract = {Background: The number of implanted total ankle replacements is
   increasing and most articles present short- and mid-term results.
   Comparison of outcomes is difficult because of inconsistent terminology
   and different use of parameters.
   Materials and methods: We created a module for total ankle prostheses in
   the framework of the International Documentation and Evaluation System
   (IDES). Content development was conducted with an iterative process
   based on a single surgeon series of 74 HINTEGRA (c) total ankle
   replacements and expert opinions.
   Results: The IDES ankle module comprises three forms A, B and C for
   recording of primary (A), revision (B) and followup (C) procedures. 74
   primary interventions, 28 revisions and 92 followups could be documented

Abstract = {BackgroundOnline questionnaires are commonly used to collect information
   from participants in epidemiological studies. This requires building
   questionnaires using machine-readable formats that can be delivered to
   study participants using web-based technologies such as progressive web
   applications. However, the paucity of open-source markup standards with
   support for complex logic make collaborative development of web-based
   questionnaire modules difficult. This often prevents interoperability
   and reusability of questionnaire modules across epidemiological
   studies.ResultsWe developed an open-source markup language for
   presentation of questionnaire content and logic, Quest, within a
   real-time renderer that enables the user to test logic (e.g., skip
   patterns) and view the structure of data collection. We provide the
   Quest markup language, an in-browser markup rendering tool,
   questionnaire development tool and an example web application that
   embeds the renderer, developed for The Connect for Cancer Prevention
   Study.ConclusionA markup language can specify both the content and logic
   of a questionnaire as plain text. Questionnaire markup, such as Quest,
   can become a standard format for storing questionnaires or sharing
   questionnaires across the web. Quest is a step towards generation of
   FAIR data in epidemiological studies by facilitating reusability of
   questionnaires and data interoperability using open-source tools.},

Abstract = {A monitoring application, called (Signed) Applet Watch-Dog, is proposed
   to control the execution of malicious Java applets that users can
   (download and) execute during Web surfing. Typical security attacks that
   the monitor can stop are related to denial-of-service and antagonism
   (e.g. obscuring the screen), at the price of a modest degradation of the
   performance of the Web browser. The Applet Watch-Dog described here is
   the second release, improving over the original version presented in R.

   execution of Java applets, in: G. Papp, R. Posch (Eds.), Proceedings of
   Fourteenth IFIP International Information Security Conference (SEC'98),
   Chapman Be Hall, London, September 1998). The application is a signed
   Java applet, to be executed outside of the sandbox, simple to use and
   easily configurable by the user, because it works like a user interface.
   Signed Applet Watch-Dog seems also a necessary tool for software

Abstract = {There has been minimal investigation into students programming their

   students' experiences of programming non-western symbols using visual

   exposed to a contextualised teaching strategy whereby cultural symbols
   were created using a web-based platform and an integrated development
   environment. In the end, 30 (N = 30) students responded to the
   questionnaires. The quantitative data revealed three key findings that
   were preferred to learning environments: 1) students' realisations of
   computers and perceived usefulness in cultural contexts; 2) students'
   motivations to succeed in computing education; 3) students' gradual
   assimilations of basic programming concepts. These findings seem to
   suggest that cultural referents stimulate students' interests to create
   indigenous projects in computing education that are also worthwhile

Abstract = {Traditional cloud computing providers enable developers to program and
   deploy applications in the cloud by using platform as a service (PaaS)
   providers. Despite the benefits of such an approach, this service model
   usually comes with a high level of the lock in effect into the service
   provider. The lock in effect occurs when a software developer needs to
   change its cloud provider. When this happens, it usually means a major
   application rewrite, specific for the new PaaS. This paper details the
   initial results of a project whose goal is to build a PaaS where vendor
   lock in does not occur. With this PaaS, developers wishing to deploy
   their applications into the cloud may continue to program using their
   usual development environments. There are no necessary changes required
   to make the application PaaS compatible. As a proof of concept, we
   developed an open source PaaS management application as a regular web
   application and then deployed it on the cloud.},

Abstract = {Loss in yield and quality of crop produce due to pest infestation could
   be reduced considerably if the pest occurrence is known in advance and
   timely remedial measures are taken. Weather plays an important role in
   pest development. Therefore, weather based models can be an effective
   scientific tool for forewarning pests in advance. In this study, weather
   based forewarning models have been developed for yellow stem borer
   {[}Scirpophaga incertulas(Walker)] and leaf folder {[}Cnaphalocrocis
   medinalis(Guenee)]of rice for different locations, viz., Aduthurai
   (Tamil Nadu), Chinsurah (West Bengal), Karjat (Maharashtra), Mandya
   (Karnataka), Ludhiana (Punjab) and Raipur (Chhattisgarh). The pest data
   comprised of population of yellow stem borer and leaf folder moths
   caught in light-trap per week for different locations. Weather data
   relating to maximum and minimum temperature (degrees C), morning and
   evening relative humidity (\%) and rainfall (mm) in respect of the
   locations were obtained from the meteorological observatories of the
   locations per se. Data of pest and weather on weekly basis in respect of
   Kharif and Rabi seasons of 11 years (2000-2010) for all locations, and
   of 16 years (1995-2010) for Mandya (KA) were used for developing the
   forewarning models. Weather of six lag weeks from week of forecast were
   used for development of weather indices. These weather indices were used
   as independent variables in model building against the pest population
   as dependent variables. Stepwise regression models for predicting the
   yellow stem borer population for peak periods of occurrence during
   Kharif {[}Aduthurai (TN), Karjat MH) \& Raipur (CG)]and Rabi
   {[}Chinsurah (WB) \& Mandya (KA)]were developed with R-2 >=
   0.9.Prediction of leaf folder for different weeks of Kharif for
   Aduthurai (TN) (32-35 SMW) and Ludhiana (PB) (32-36 SMW) and of Rabi for
   Aduthurai (TN) (44-47 SMW) gave R-2 between 0.6 and 0.8, respectively
   indicating better leaf folder prediction for Rabi over Kharif season at
   Aduthurai (TN). Validation of the models for subsequent years (2011) has
   been done for all cases. These developed models were converted into
   web-based forewarning system using 3-tier architecture. Net Beans 8.0.1
   IDE (Integrated Development Environment), MS SQL Server, Java Server
   Pages (JSP) technologies have been used for the development of the web
   enabled forecasting of the two rice pests.},

Abstract = {Effectively identifying and analyzing materials are key procedures for
   breeding novel crop varieties because of the large quantities of
   materials and their combinations. This paper presents an approach for
   crop breeding material management, improvement of crop breeding
   efficiency, and genealogical tracking through the golden seed breeding
   cloud platform (GSBCP). The system was developed with Java on an Eclipse
   integrated development environment. To support a large number of users,
   security, credibility, and expandability, we selected a cloud-based
   architecture for the system, in which material attribute, pedigree, and
   trait information were customized by a template. An intelligent
   retrieval function was provided for the rapid search of breeding
   materials, and material trait information, historical data, genealogical
   information, trial data analysis results and material images can be
   retrieved in the system. For the analysis of the materials' genealogy,
   the rules of genealogy were regulated. The genealogy of the breeding
   materials was automatically generated on the basis of these rules, which
   support many breeding methods, such as selfing, hybridization, double
   cross, three-way cross, and backcross. The developed system has been
   successfully applied in many Chinese breeding enterprises and scientific
   research institutions. The system provided a low-cost and highly
   efficient solution for crop material information management and
   genealogical tracking.},

Title = {Adapting EcoCyc for use on the World Wide Web},
Journal = {GENE-COMBIS},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {172},
Pages = {GC43-GC50},
Abstract = {The World Wide Web (WWW) offers the potential to deliver specialized
   information to an audience of unprecedented size. Along with this
   exciting new opportunity comes a challenge for software developers:
   instead of rewriting our software applications to operate over the WWW,
   how can we maximize software reuse by retrofitting existing
   applications? We have developed a Web server tool, written in Common
   Lisp, that allows existing graphical user interface applications written
   using the Common Lisp Interface Manager (CLIM) to hook easily into the
   WWW. This tool - CWEST (CLIM-WEb Server Tool, pronounced `'quest'') -
   was developed to operate with EcoCyc, an electronic encyclopedia of the
   genes and metabolism of the bacterium E. coli. EcoCyc consists of a
   database of objects relevant to E. coli biochemistry and a user
   interface, implemented in CLIM, that runs on the X-window system and
   generates graphical displays appropriate to biological objects. Each
   query to the EcoCyc WWW server is treated as a command to the EcoCyc
   program, which dynamically generates an appropriate CLIM drawing. CWEST
   translates that drawing, which can be a mixture of text and graphics,
   into the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and/or the Graphics
   Interchange Format (GIF), which are returned to the client. Sensitive
   regions embedded in the CLIM drawing are converted to hyperlinks with
   Universal Resource Locators (URLs) that generate further EcoCyc queries.
   This tight coupling of CLIM output with Web output makes CLIM a powerful
   high-level programming tool for Web applications. The flexibility of
   Common Lisp and CLIM made implementation of the server tool surprisingly
   easy, requiring few changes to the existing EcoCyc program. The results
   can be seen at URL http://www.ai.sri.com/ecocyc/browser.html. We have
   made CWEST available to the CLIM community at large, with the hope that
   it will spur other software developers to make their CLIM applications
   available over the WWW.},

Abstract = {Using cloud-based services can improve the performance, reliability, and
   scalability of a software application. However, transitioning an
   application to use cloud-based services is difficult, costly, and
   error-prone. The required re-engineering effort includes migrating to
   the cloud the functionality to be accessed as remote cloud-based
   services and re-targeting the client code accordingly. In addition, the
   client must be able to detect and handle the faults raised in the
   process of invoking the services. As a means of streamlining this
   transitioning, we developed a set of refactoring techniques-automated,
   IDE-assisted program transformations that eliminate the need to change
   programs by hand. In particular, we show how a programmer can extract
   services, add fault tolerance functionality, and adapt client code to
   invoke cloud services via refactorings integrated with a modern IDE. As
   a validation, we have applied our approach to automatically transform
   two third-party Java applications to use cloud-based services. We have
   also applied our approach to re-engineer a suite of services operated by
   General Electric to use cloud-based resources to better satisfy the GE
   business requirements.},

Abstract = {The effect of nucleos(t)ide analogues therapy in patients with
   decompensated cirrhosis remains unclear.
   The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of nucleos(t)ide
   analogues on decompensated cirrhotic patients.
   An online search within PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Central
   of Register of Controlled Trials and China Biology Medicine disc from
   1998-01-01 to 2011-09-05 was conducted. A meta-analysis was performed.
   Relative risks of mortality rate, Child-Pugh-Turcotte score and
   hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion of the decompensated
   patients were studied.
   Eight studies involving 511 patients were included. Data showed that
   lamivudine and telbivudine significantly decreased the mortality rate
   (relative risk 0.36, 95 \% confidence interval 0.25-0.54), improved the
   Child-Pugh-Turcotte scores (mean difference -3.23, 95 \% confidence
   interval -3.98 to -2.48) and promoted HBeAg seroconversion (relative
   risk 7.48, 95 \% confidence interval 2.31-24.20).
   For patients with decompensated cirrhosis, lamivudine and telbivudine
   significantly decrease the mortality rate and disease severity. Also,
   they promote their HBeAg seroconversion.},

Abstract = {As computing becomes pervasive across fields, introductory computing
   curricula needs new tools to motivate and educate the influx of learners
   with little prior background and divergent goals. We seek to improve
   curricula by enriching it with authentic, real-world contexts and
   powerful scaffolds that can guide learners to success using automated
   tools, thereby reducing the strain on limited human instructional
   resources. To address these issues, we have created the BlockPy
   programming environment, a web-based, open-access, open-source platform
   for introductory computing students (https://www.blockpy.com). BlockPy
   has an embedded data science context that allows learners to connect the
   educational content with real-world scenarios through meaningful
   problems. The environment is block-based and gives guiding feedback to
   learners as they complete problems, but also mediates transfer to more
   sophisticated programming environments by supporting bidirectional,
   seamless transitions between block and text programming. Although it can
   be used as a stand-alone application, the environment has first-class
   support for the latest Learning Tools Interoperability standards, so
   that instructors can embed the environment directly within their
   Learning Management System. In this paper, we describe interesting
   design issues that we encountered during the development of BlockPy, an
   evaluation of the environment from fine-grained logs, and our future
   plans for the environment.},

Abstract = {The World Wide Web (WWW) offers the potential to deliver specialized
   information to an audience of unprecedented size. Along with this
   exciting new opportunity comes a challenge for software developers:
   instead of rewriting our software applications to operate over the WWW,
   how can we maximize software reuse by retrofitting existing
   applications? We have developed a Web server tool, written in Common
   Lisp, that allows existing graphical user interface applications written
   using the Common Lisp Interface Manager (CLIM) to hook easily into the
   WWW. This tool - CWEST (CLIM-WEb Server Tool, pronounced `'quest'') -
   was developed to operate with EcoCyc, an electronic encyclopedia of the
   genes and metabolism of the bacterium E. coli. EcoCyc consists of a
   database of objects relevant to E. coli biochemistry and a user
   interface, implemented in CLIM, that runs on the X-window system and
   generates graphical displays appropriate to biological objects. Each
   query to the EcoCyc WWW server is treated as a command to the EcoCyc
   program, which dynamically generates an appropriate CLIM drawing. CWEST
   translates that drawing, which can be a mixture of text and graphics,
   into the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and/or the Graphics
   Interchange Format (GIF), which are returned to the client. Sensitive
   regions embedded in the CLIM drawing are converted to hyperlinks with
   Universal Resource Locators (URLs) that generate further EcoCyc queries.
   This tight coupling of CLIM output with Web output makes CLIM a powerful
   high-level programming tool for Web applications. The flexibility of
   Common Lisp and CLIM made implementation of the server tool surprisingly
   easy, requiring few changes to the existing EcoCyc program. The results
   can be seen at URL http://www.ai.sri.com/ecocyc/browser.html. We have
   made CWEST available to the CLIM community at large, with the hope that
   it will spur other software developers to make their CLIM applications
   available over the WWW.},

Month = {FEB 19},
Abstract = {Population genetics focuses on the analysis of genetic differences
   within and between-group of individuals and the inference of the
   populations' structure. These analyses are usually carried out using
   Bayesian clustering or maximum likelihood estimation algorithms that
   assign individuals to a given population depending on specific genetic
   patterns. Although several tools were developed to perform population
   genetics analysis, their standard graphical outputs may not be
   sufficiently informative for users lacking interactivity and complete
   information. StructuRly aims to resolve this problem by offering a
   complete environment for population analysis. In particular, StructuRly
   combines the statistical power of the R language with the friendly
   interfaces implemented using the shiny libraries to provide a novel tool
   for performing population clustering, evaluating several genetic
   indexes, and comparing results. Moreover, graphical representations are
   interactive and can be easily personalized. StructuRly is available
   either as R package on GitHub, with detailed information for its
   installation and use and as shinyapps.io servers for those users who are
   not familiar with R and the RStudio IDE. The application has been tested
   on Linux, macOS and Windows operative systems and can be launched as a

Abstract = {Recent advancements in life-science instrumentation and automation
   enable entirely new modes of human interaction with microbiological
   processes and corresponding applications for science and education
   through biology cloud laboratories. A critical barrier for remote and
   on-site life-science experimentation (for both experts and nonexperts
   alike) is the absence of suitable abstractions and interfaces for
   programming living matter. To this end we conceptualize a programming
   paradigm that provides stimulus and sensor control functions for
   real-time manipulation of physical biological matter. Additionally, a
   simulation mode facilitates higher user throughput, program debugging,
   and biophysical modeling. To evaluate this paradigm, we implemented a
   JavaScript-based web toolkit, ``Bioty,{''} that supports real-time
   interaction with swarms of phototactic Euglena cells hosted on a cloud
   laboratory. Studies with remote and on-site users demonstrate that
   individuals with little to no biology knowledge and intermediate
   programming knowledge were able to successfully create and use
   scientific applications and games. This work informs the design of
   programming environments for controlling living matter in general, for
   living material microfabrication and swarm robotics applications, and
   for lowering the access barriers to the life sciences for professional
   and citizen scientists, learners, and the lay public.},

Abstract = {Revisiting the seminal 2010 Nolan and Temple Lang article on the role of
   computing in the statistics curricula, we discuss several trends that
   have emerged over the last ten years. The rise of data science has
   coincided with a broadening audience for learning statistics and using
   computational packages and tools. It has also increased the need for
   communication skills. We argue that, for most of this audience,
   instruction should focus on foundational concepts and the early
   introduction of different types of data and modern methods through the
   use of interactive learning environments without programming
   prerequisites. We then describe Integrated Statistics Learning
   Environment (ISLE), a web-based e-learning platform and lesson authoring
   framework for teaching statistics. Built on top of computing and
   peer-to-peer technology, the platform allows collaborative data analysis
   and real-time interactions in the classroom. We describe how ISLE
   contributes to the three key Nolan and Temple Lang components:
   broadening the statistical computing curriculum, deepening computational
   reasoning and literacy, and expanding computing with data in the
   practice of statistics. We then present several advantages of using a
   computing-integrated environment such as ISLE, including promoting
   (cross-disciplinary) communication, supporting classroom-focused
   integrated development environments, and advancing the science of data

Abstract = {Two major attributes influence a project aimed at developing educational
   software: user interactivity and graphic design. These two attributes
   are not easily found within the same development tool. Moreover,
   sometimes the development tool is either very expensive to acquire or
   too difficult to use. This article aims to present a solution to the
   creation of educational development tools which emphasize the
   conjunction between interactivity and graphic design. The authors
   propose a methodology based on Web technology and an association between
   the Java programming language and the authoring tool Flash. In addition
   to fostering interactivity, Java offers development packages at no cost.
   The authoring software Flash is inexpensive and allows the creation of
   finely crafted Web pages with graphic animations and sound editing. This
   article describes the methodology that enables the association between
   Java and Flash components. This methodology was conceived during the
   development of a structural analysis educational software product
   specially geared to undergraduate engineering students. In order to
   ensure the understanding of our proposal, a specific example was
   created, along with sample pages that illustrate this methodology. (C)

Title = {RETRACTED: Research and Development of an IoT-Based Remote Asthma
   Patient Monitoring System (Retracted Article)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {This paper presents the research and development of an Internet of
   Things- (IoT-) based remote health monitoring system for asthmatic
   patients. Asthma is an inflammatory disease. Asthma causes the lungs to
   swell and get narrower, making it difficult to carry air in and out of
   the lungs. This situation makes breathing very difficult. Remote patient
   monitoring (RPM) is a method of collecting health-related data from
   patients who are in a remote location and electronically transmitting it
   to healthcare providers for evaluation and consultation. The aim of this
   study is to design a monitoring system that allows doctors to monitor
   asthmatic patients from a remote area. The proposed system will allow
   patients to measure oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate, body
   temperature, humidity, volatile gases, room temperature, and
   electrocardiogram (ECG) using various sensors, which will be displayed
   in an application. This data is then sent to the doctor to monitor the
   patient's condition and suggest appropriate actions. Overall, the system
   consists of an Android application, a website, and various sensors. The
   Android studio and Java programming language were used to develop the
   application. For the frontend, the website was built using Hypertext
   Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), JavaScript, and
   jQuery. The system also uses Django, a Python-based open-source web
   framework, for the backend. The system developed the various sensors
   using an ESP8266 microcontroller compatible with the Arduino Integrated
   Development Environment (IDE). The system uses a MAX30100 pulse oximeter
   and heart rate sensor, a GY-906 MLX90614 noncontact precision
   thermometer, a DHT11 humidity and temperature sensor, a MQ-135 gas and
   air quality sensor, and an AD8232 ECG sensor for collecting various
   parameters that may trigger asthma attacks. Finally, the system
   developed the Asthma Tracker app and the Asthma Tracker website for
   remote health monitoring. The system was initially tested on demo
   patients and later deployed and tested on seven real human test
   subjects. Overall, the monitoring system produced satisfactory results.
   The data acquired by the sensors has a high level of accuracy. The
   system also maintained user-friendliness and low cost.},

Abstract = {An important challenge in the age of Internet business is the proper
   alignment of customers' needs with the business system. In order to
   improve an Internet business system according to customers' needs
   continuously, reuse of design results is of particular importance. This
   paper proposes a development environment, called eBizBench, which
   provides support for this alignment and reusability. The eBizBench
   includes seven functions: (1) project management, (2) customer analysis,
   (3) value analysis, (4) web design, (5) implementation design, (6)
   repository management, and (7) repository. The eBizBench can help
   develop and maintain Internet business systems in a systematic fashion.
   The repository is useful for the conversion of design results among
   development environments. A real-life web site is illustrated to
   demonstrate the usefulness of the eBizBench. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Kinetically controlled glass transition measurement of organic aerosol

Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES},
Year = {2018},

Pages = {3479-3490},

Abstract = {Glass transitions from liquid to semi-solid and solid phase states have
   important implications for reactivity, growth, and cloud-forming (cloud
   condensation nuclei and ice nucleation) capabilities of secondary
   organic aerosols (SOAs). The small size and relatively low mass
   concentration of SOAs in the atmosphere make it difficult to measure
   atmospheric SOA glass transitions using conventional methods. To
   circumvent these difficulties, we have adapted a new technique for
   measuring glass-forming properties of atmospherically relevant organic
   aerosols. Aerosol particles to be studied are deposited in the form of a
   thin film onto an interdigitated electrode (IDE) using electrostatic
   precipitation. Dielectric spectroscopy provides dipole relaxation rates
   for organic aerosols as a function of temperature (373 to 233 K) that
   are used to calculate the glass transition temperatures for several
   cooling or heating rates. IDE-enabled broadband dielectric spectroscopy
   (BDS) was successfully used to measure the kinetically controlled glass
   transition temperatures of aerosols consisting of glycerol and four
   other compounds with selected cooling and heating rates. The glass
   transition results agree well with available literature data for these
   five compounds. The results indicate that the IDE-BDS method can provide
   accurate glass transition data for organic aerosols under atmospheric
   conditions. The BDS data obtained with the IDE-BDS technique can be used
   to characterize glass transitions for both simulated and ambient organic
   aerosols and to model their climate effects.},

Abstract = {An improved differential evolution (IDE) algorithm-based Elman neural
   network (ENN) controller is proposed to control a squirrel-cage
   induction generator (SCIG) system for grid-connected wind power
   applications. First, the control characteristics of a wind turbine
   emulator are introduced. Then, an AC/DC converter and a DC/AC inverter
   are developed to convert the electric power generated by a three-phase
   SCIG to the grid. Moreover, the dynamic model of the SCIG system is
   derived for the control of the square of DC-link voltage according to
   the principle of power balance. Furthermore, in order to improve the
   transient and steady-state responses of the square of DC-link voltage of
   the SCIG system, an IDE-based ENN controller is proposed for the control
   of the SCIG system. In addition, the network structure and the online
   learning algorithm of the ENN are described in detail. Additionally,
   according to the different wind speed variations, a lookup table built
   offline by the dynamic model of the SCIG system using the IDE is
   provided for the optimisation of the learning rates of ENN. Finally, to
   verify the control performance, some experimental results are provided
   to verify the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed SCIG
   system for grid-connected wind power applications.},

Title = {osFP: a web server for predicting the oligomeric states of fluorescent
   proteins},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {Background: Currently, monomeric fluorescent proteins (FP) are ideal
   markers for protein tagging. The prediction of oligomeric states is
   helpful for enhancing live biomedical imaging. Computational prediction
   of FP oligomeric states can accelerate the effort of protein engineering
   efforts of creating monomeric FPs. To the best of our knowledge, this
   study represents the first computational model for predicting and
   analyzing FP oligomerization directly from the amino acid sequence.
   Results: After data curation, an exhaustive data set consisting of 397
   non-redundant FP oligomeric states was compiled from the literature.
   Results from benchmarking of the protein descriptors revealed that the
   model built with amino acid composition descriptors was the top
   performing model with accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in excess of
   80\% and MCC greater than 0.6 for all three data subsets (e.g. training,
   tenfold cross-validation and external sets). The model provided insights
   on the important residues governing the oligomerization of FP. To
   maximize the benefit of the generated predictive model, it was
   implemented as a web server under the R programming environment.
   Conclusion: osFP affords a user-friendly interface that can be used to
   predict the oligomeric state of FP using the protein sequence. The
   advantage of osFP is that it is platform-independent meaning that it can
   be accessed via a web browser on any operating system and device. osFP
   is freely accessible at http://codes.bio/osfp/ while the source code and
   data set is provided on GitHub at https://github.com/chaninn/osFP/.},

Abstract = {. -The following document presents the development of a humidity sensor

   various applications that new technologies can offer, particularly in
   the cocoa industry. It involves designing a humidity sensor node to
   measure changes in humidity and temperature using the electronic design
   tool Proteus. The measurement module is programmed in Arduino IDE and
   connected to the cloud via IoT, incorporating Node-RED as a means to
   remotely visualize real-time results. This is achieved through a
   presentation dashboard as the final output of the measurement process,
   collecting data on climate changes received by the transducer and
   comparing them with data obtained from the web over a specified period.
   This process verifies the sensor's efficiency and data accuracy, setting
   a precedent for future research in applied electronics, IoT, and

Abstract = {Health care is one of the least funded sectors in Bangladesh and many
   other similar developing countries. People living in rural and remote
   areas do not have access to proper health care, and when they do, it is
   too expensive. This research aimed to develop a real-time health
   monitoring system that is cheap, easy to use, and accessible by doctors
   and patients. The system consists of several Internet of Things
   (IoT)-based sensors connected to an Arduino microprocessor, which thus
   measures the vital body signs of the patients. The measured readings are
   then transmitted to an Android application on a smartphone via a
   Bluetooth module. The sensors are connected to analog inputs. These
   sensors measure analog data, which is amplified by the microprocessor
   after being sorted. Doctors can also carry out the diagnosis of ailments
   using the data collected remotely from the patient. An Android-based
   mobile application that interfaces with a web-based application is
   implemented for efficient patients-doctors dual real-time communication.
   The Android application, which is connected to a MySQL database, updates
   the said database, which updates and displays the readings on a website
   accessible by both doctors and patients. Initially, the health monitor
   was tested using an Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
   monitor and a single user. Once initial simulations were successful, the
   proposed system was tested on five different real-human test subjects.
   The testing of the wireless health monitor produced successful results
   that measured patient vitals with a high level of accuracy. The proposed
   IoT-based system monitors vital signs such as the patient's body
   temperature, heart rate, ECG, SpO2 levels, blood pressure, and glucose
   levels. This system also includes a medical treatment plan by the
   doctors. The proposed system is novel as it integrates the IoT-based
   patient monitoring system with telemedicine. This proposed system has
   different sensors for real-time measuring the vital signs of the human
   body. A mobile and web application have also been integrated with this
   system for real-time remote patient monitoring and treatment plan. There
   are now systems available that only offer a telemedicine facility, where
   patients and doctors can have discussions, but do not have an IoT-based
   patient vital sign monitoring system integrated with telemedicine. The
   proposed system in this paper has the facility of IoT-based patient
   vital signs monitoring integrated with telemedicine, which makes this
   research work novel. The proposed system will increase the life
   expectancy of people throughout the world.},

Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-HUMAN INTERACTION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {End users with little formal programming background are creating
   software in many different forms, including spreadsheets, web macros,
   and web mashups. Web mashups are particularly popular because they are
   relatively easy to create, and because many programming environments
   that support their creation are available. These programming
   environments, however, provide no support for tracking versions or
   provenance of mashups. We believe that versioning support can help end
   users create, understand, and debug mashups. To investigate this belief,
   we have added versioning support to a popular wire-oriented mashup
   environment, Yahoo! Pipes. Our enhanced environment, which we call
   ``Pipes Plumber,{''} automatically retains versions of pipes and
   provides an interface with which pipe programmers can browse histories
   of pipes and retrieve specific versions. We have conducted two studies
   of this environment: an exploratory study and a larger controlled
   experiment. Our results provide evidence that versioning helps pipe
   programmers create and debug mashups. Subsequent qualitative results
   provide further insights into the barriers faced by pipe programmers,
   the support for reuse provided by our approach, and the support for
   debugging provided.},

Abstract = {Informal language and the absence of a standard taxonomy for software
   technologies make it difficult to reliably analyze technology trends on
   discussion forums and other on-line venues. We propose an automated
   approach called \$\textbackslash{}mathrm\{Witt\}\$ Witt for the
   categorization of software technologies (an expanded version of the
   hypernym discovery problem). \$\textbackslash{}mathrm\{Witt\}\$ Witt
   takes as input a phrase describing a software technology or concept and
   returns a general category that describes it (e.g., integrated
   development environment), along with attributes that further qualify it
   (commercial, php, etc.). By extension, the approach enables the dynamic
   creation of lists of all technologies of a given type (e.g., web
   application frameworks). Our approach relies on Stack Overflow and
   Wikipedia, and involves numerous original domain adaptations and a new
   solution to the problem of normalizing automatically-detected hypernyms.
   We compared \$\textbackslash{}mathrm\{Witt\}\$ Witt with six independent
   taxonomy tools and found that, when applied to software terms,
   \$\textbackslash{}mathrm\{Witt\}\$ Witt demonstrated better coverage
   than all evaluated alternative solutions, without a corresponding
   degradation in false positive rate.},

Title = {A declarative enhancement of JavaScript programs by leveraging the Java
   metadata infrastructure},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {181},
Pages = {27-46},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Web browsers have evolved into indispensable software platforms for
   modern applications. Although JavaScript has become a de-facto lingua
   franca for developing web applications, the JavaScript software
   development tools and methodologies lag behind those of languages such
   as Java and C\#. In particular, to enhance JavaScript programs with
   non-functional concerns (e.g., persistence, security, transactions, and
   logging) JavaScript developers need to modify the source code by hand.
   Developers then often end up having to maintain the resulting modified
   version separately for reasons that include poor design, the
   complexities of program evolution, and fundamental language limitations.
   The necessity to modify code by hand could be avoided if JavaScript had
   metadata facilities for developers to specify non-functional concerns
   declaratively.
   To address this problem, we present a novel declarative approach,
   Transparent Automated Enhancement for JavaScript (TAE-JS) that enhances
   JavaScript programs with the ability to use declarative metadata. The
   metadata is expressed by means of Java annotations. We have implemented
   our technique in an open-source plug-in for the Eclipse IDE. This plugin
   allows a developer to enhance the original version of a JavaScript
   program by specifying concerns declaratively using Java annotations. It
   then analyzes an original version of the program to automatically
   generate enhanced program versions by adding the declared concerns. We
   evaluated TAE-JS with four practical examples that enhance JavaScript
   programs by declaratively adding concerns such as persistence, security,
   transactions, and logging. In a user study with ten student developers
   and three professional engineers at PayPal, the participants viewed
   favorably TAE-JS's flexible declarative enhancement capabilities, seeing
   them as a valuable mechanism for implementing non-functional concerns in
   JavaScript programs. Our evaluation results are promising in
   demonstrating the potential benefits of our approach to complement
   existing JavaScript development tools. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {JAN 14},
Abstract = {The understanding of the biodiversity and biogeographical distribution
   of fungi is still limited. The small number of online databases and the
   large effort required to access existing data have prevented their use
   in research articles. The Mycology Collections Portal was established in
   2012 to help alleviate these issues and currently serves data online for
   over 4.3 million fungal records. However, the current process for
   accessing the data through the web interface is manual, therefore slow,
   and precludes the extensive use of the existing datasets. Here we
   introduce the software package rMyCoPortal, which allows users rapid,
   automated access to the data. rMyCoPortal makes data readily available
   for further computations and analyses in the open source statistical
   programming environment R. We will demonstrate the core functions of the
   package, and how rMyCoPortal can be employed to obtain fungal data that
   can be used to address basic research questions. rMyCoPortal is a free

   raindrops. The acquired sensor data is transmitted to the node MCU
   controller, whereas the Arduino IDE is utilized in posting the data. The
   serial monitor is placed as a gateway linking IoT sensors with cloud
   servers. The data is transmitted from IoT sensors to a serial monitor
   wherein the corresponding IP address is monitored. Finally, the data is
   read from the webserver using the HTTP protocol. The environmental
   parameter data are shown on a website to monitor weather data. Anyone
   can check the weather's state from anyplace utilizing a web server
   without relying webpage since the sensed data is provided in a public
   mode.},

Abstract = {Configuring and setting up a remote access laboratory for an advanced
   online school on fully programmable System-on-Chip (SoC) proved to be an
   outstanding challenge. The school, jointly organized by the

   applications to nuclear and scientific instrumentation and was mainly
   addressed to physicists, computer scientists and engineers from
   developing countries. The use of e-learning tools, which some of them
   adopted and others developed, allowed the school participants to
   directly access both integrated development environment software and
   programmable SoC platforms. This facilitated the follow-up of all
   proposed exercises and the final project. During the four weeks of the
   training activity, we faced and overcame different technology and
   communication challenges, whose solutions we describe in detail together
   with dedicated tools and design methodology. We finally present a
   summary of the gained experience and an assessment of the results we
   achieved, addressed to those who foresee to organize similar initiatives

Journal = {BIODATA MINING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 2},
Abstract = {Background: Heterogeneous biological data such as sequence matches, gene
   expression correlations, protein-protein interactions, and biochemical
   pathways can be merged and analyzed via graphs, or networks. Existing
   software for network analysis has limited scalability to large data sets
   or is only accessible to software developers as libraries. In addition,
   the polymorphic nature of the data sets requires a more standardized
   method for integration and exploration.
   Results: Mango facilitates large network analyses with its Graph
   Exploration Language, automatic graph attribute handling, and real-time
   3-dimensional visualization. On a personal computer Mango can load,
   merge, and analyze networks with millions of links and can connect to
   online databases to fetch and merge biological pathways.
   Conclusions: Mango is written in C++ and runs on Mac OS, Windows, and
   Linux. The stand-alone distributions, including the Graph Exploration
   Language integrated development environment, are freely available for
   download from http://www.complex.iastate.edu/download/Mango. The Mango

Abstract = {Many emerging smart applications rely on the Internet of Things (IoT) to
   provide solutions to time-critical problems. When building such
   applications, a software engineer must address multiple Non-Functional
   Requirements (NFRs), including requirements for fast response time, low
   communication latency, high throughput, high energy efficiency, low
   operational cost and similar. Existing modern container-based software
   engineering approaches promise to improve the software lifecycle;
   however, they fail short of tools and mechanisms for NFRs management and
   optimisation. Our work addresses this problem with a new decision-making
   approach based on a Pareto Multi-Criteria optimisation. By using
   different instance configurations on various geo-locations, we
   demonstrate the suitability of our method, which narrows the search
   space to only optimal instances for the deployment of the containerised
   microservice. This solution is included in two advanced software
   engineering environments, the SWITCH workbench, which includes an
   Interactive Development Environment (IDE) and the ENTICE Virtual Machine
   and container images portal. The developed approach is particularly
   useful when building, deploying and orchestrating IoT applications
   across multiple computing tiers, from Edge-Cloudlet to Fog-Cloud data

Abstract = {The Interplanetary Dust Experiment (IDE), one of the 56 experiments
   carried by LDEF, was, designed to detect impacts of extra-terrestrial
   particles and orbital debris. The IDE detectors (which covered about one
   square meter of the surface of LDEF) were sensitive to particles ranging
   in size from about 0.2 mum to 100 mum. The IDE experiment recorded the
   location in orbit and approximate origin direction for each impact. The
   resulting dataset represents perhaps the most extensive record ever
   gathered of the number and location of impacts due to small particles on
   a spacecraft in Earth orbit. The IDE dataset shows that impacts often
   occurred in `'bursts'' reoccurring each orbit. Such events, which we
   have designated Multiple orbit Events, can occur only if the impacting
   particles are in an Earth orbit that intersects that of LDEF. We have
   examined several such event sequences in the LDEF IDE dataset and have
   found orbital debris concentrations distributed in both moderate
   inclination (ca. 25-degrees-35-degrees) and high inclination (>
   60-degrees) orbits. A peak flux of at least 12 impacts/second/sq. meter
   was detected in one such cloud. This is nearly 4 orders of magnitude
   above the mean flux observed over the LDEF 5.77 year mission duration.},

Title = {A study of dynamic design dualities in a web-supported community of
   practice for teachers},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {161-177},
Abstract = {The concept of a community of practice (CoP) is prevalent in several
   venues for teachers' professional development, especially in online
   environments. However, there are few descriptive accounts that
   effectively represent a CoP in a manner that will be of use to other
   designers. In order to illuminate potential difficulties which may arise
   when attempting to design a framework to characterize or to build a CoP,
   this study describes the dynamics of five dualities (specific areas of
   tension) that were identified during the design and testing period of
   the Inquiry Learning Forum (ILF), a Web-based community for teachers'
   professional development. During the three-year design trajectory of the
   ILF, these five dualities emerged from and characterized the
   interactions between the participating teachers and the site designers.
   As part of the data collection for this study, we conducted document
   analyses, interviews with designers, researchers, and teachers, and
   observations of online and face-to-face meetings. The findings of this
   study are intended to help future Web-designers both to better realize
   the full potential of online professional development environments and
   to avoid potential design development issues which may hamper the
   utility or participation rates in newly created CoPs.},

Abstract = {Cloud computing is a current trend that reveals the next-generation
   application architecture and it is estimated that by 2013 the cloud
   market will have reached \$8.1bn. While cloud services such as web-mail,
   Flickr and YouTube have been widely used by individuals for some time,
   it not until relatively recently that organisations have began to use
   cloud services as a tool for meeting their IT needs. This study aims to
   investigate how cloud computing is understood by IT professionals and
   the concerns that IT professionals have in regard to the adoption of
   cloud services. The study was carried out in Taiwan and used a survey by
   interview approach to understand IT professionals' understandings and
   concerns about cloud computing. The findings of the study suggest that
   while the benefits of cloud computing such as its computational power
   and ability to help companies save costs are often mentioned in the
   literature, the primary concerns that IT managers and software engineers
   have are compatibility of the cloud with companies' policy, IS
   development environment, and business needs: and relative advantages of
   adopting cloud solutions. The findings also suggest that most IT
   companies in Taiwan will not adopt cloud computing until the
   uncertainties associated with cloud computing, e.g. security and
   standardisation are reduced and successful business models have emerged.

Abstract = {Background: Chronic hepatitis b (CHB) is a serious problem worldwide.
   Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and entecavir (ETV) both are
   first-line drugs for CHB, but there is debate about which is more
   appropriate in nucleos(t)ide analogue-naive CHB.
   Objective: To systematically evaluate the effectiveness and safety of
   tenofovir and ETV in nucleos(t)ide analogue-naive CHB.
   Methods: The Web of Science, PubMed, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE,
   Clinical Trials, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases
   will be electronically searched to collect randomized controlled trials
   regarding the comparison between tenofovir and ETV in nucleos(t) ide
   analogue-naive CHB since the date of database inception to July 2019.
   Two researchers independently screened and evaluated the obtained
   studies and extracted the outcome indexes. RevMan 5.3 software will be
   used for the meta-analysis.
   Result: We will provide practical and targeted results assessing the
   effectiveness and safety of TDF and ETV for nucleos(t) ide
   analogue-naive CHB patients, try to compare the advantages of TDF and
   ETV.
   Conclusion: The stronger evidence about the effectiveness and safety of
   TDF and ETV for nucleos(t) ide analogue-naive CHB patients will be
   provided for clinicians.

Abstract = {Much of the research on how social media is embedded into the
   educational practices of higher education students has a Western
   orientation. In concentrating on a case study of the varied ways in
   which African International Distance Education (IDE) students actively
   use social media to shape their learning experiences, we discuss an
   under-researched group. The paper draws on analysis of 1295 online
   questionnaires and 165 in-depth interviews with IDE students at UNISA,
   South Africa, one of the largest providers of IDE globally. WhatsApp
   emerges as `the' key social media tool that opens up opportunities for
   IDE students to transfer, translate and transform their educational
   journey when studying `at a distance'. Although WhatsApp does provide a
   `space of opportunity' for some students, this is framed through
   socio-technical marginalisation, itself a reflection of demographic
   legacies of inequality. Exploring social media practices though the case
   of African IDE students places these students centre stage and adds to
   the awareness of the multiple centres from which international education
   is practiced.},

Abstract = {Recently, graphic boards have come to have higher performance than CPUs
   as a result of the development of 3DCG and movie processing, and are now
   widely used due to progress in computer entertainment. Implementation of
   general-purpose computing on GPU (GPGPU) has become easier as a result
   of the integrated development environment CUDA distributed by NVIDIA. A
   GPU has dozens or hundreds of arithmetic circuits, whose allocations are
   controlled by CUDA. In prior research, the implementation of a neural
   network using GPGPU has been studied; however, the training of networks
   was not mentioned because the GPU performance is low in conditional
   processing but high in linear algebra processing. Therefore, we have
   proposed two methods. First, a whole network is implemented as a thread,
   and some networks are trained in parallel to shorten the time necessary
   to find the optimal weight coefficients. Second, this paper introduces
   parallelization in the neural network structure, in which the
   calculation of neurons in the same layers is parallelized. The
   processing to train the same network with different patterns is likewise
   independent. As a result, the second method is 20 times faster than the
   CPU, and 6 times as fast as the first proposed method. (c) 2013 Wiley

Abstract = {The amount of accessible computational devices over the Internet offers
   an enormous but latent computational power. Nonetheless, the complexity
   of orchestrating and managing such devices requires dedicated
   architectures and tools and hinders the exploitation of this vast
   processing capacity. Over the last years, the paradigm of
   (Browser-based) Volunteer Computing emerged as a unique approach to
   harnessing such computational capabilities, leveraging the idea of
   voluntarily offering resources. This article proposes VFuse, a
   groundbreaking architecture to exploit the Browser-based Volunteer
   Computing paradigm via a ready-to-access volunteer network. VFuse offers
   a modern multi-language programming environment for developing
   scientific workflows using WebAssembly technology without requiring the
   user any local installation or configuration. We equipped our
   architecture with a secure and transparent rewarding mechanism based on
   blockchain technology (Ethereum) and distributed P2P file system (IPFS).
   Further, the use of Non-Fungible Tokens provides a unique, secure, and
   transparent methodology for recognizing the users' participation in the
   network. We developed a prototype of the proposed architecture and four
   example applications implemented with our system. All code and examples

Abstract = {His paper presents a tool facilitating developers of user interfaces
   (UIs) to experience accessibility limitations that can be posed from
   various disabilities during the interaction of impaired users with their
   developments. In this respect, various aspects of visual, hearing,
   physical and cognitive impairments have been modelled through filters
   providing approximate, yet, realistic simulations over them. These
   filters have formed the basis for the developed tool, which can be used
   either on its own (as a standalone application), or be embedded in the
   NetBeans Integrated Development Environment. The tool, named DIAS,
   allows for impairment simulations to be performed over Java, mobile and
   web applications. Moreover, it integrates two of the most common
   assistive technologies (ATs), namely a screen reader and a magnifier. As
   a result, developers of UIs can not only experience how interaction
   would be affected from various impairments, but they can also understand
   how their developments would be perceived by impaired users through an
   AT. This work aims to provide an integrated, practical solution for
   impairment simulation, which could be easily adopted by developers, thus
   realistically increasing the possibilities for the future development of
   interactive applications that are more accessible to users with

Title = {A Middle-Up Approach with Online Capillary Isoelectric Focusing/Mass

   Heterogeneity},

Abstract = {Previously, we reported a new online capillary isoelectric focusing/mass
   spectrometric (CIEF/MS) method for intact monoclonal antibody (mAb)
   charge variant analysis that uses an electrokinetically pumped
   sheath-flow nanospray ion source on a time-of-flight (TOF) MS with a
   pressure-assisted chemical mobilization. The direct online CIEF/MS
   method exhibited excellent resolution of charge variants conforming to
   those of imaged capillary isoelectric focusing with ultraviolet
   detection (iCIEF/UV). However, for complex mAbs, CIEF/MS spectra of the
   intact charge variant peaks may be too convoluted to be effectively
   interpreted. In the present study, we implemented a middle-up approach
   to enhance the capability of the CIEF/MS method for characterizing
   complex mAb charge variants by reducing sample complexity. To
   demonstrate such a strategy, we fragmented cetuximab through IdeS
   enzymatic cleavage and dithiothreitol (DTT) reduction. For the first
   time, online CIEF/MS resolved the complex charge variants of cetuximab
   at subunit level, corroborating the profiles obtained by iCIEF/UV.
   Furthermore, high-resolution TOF mass spectra with high mass accuracy
   were obtained for the eight charge variants separated by CIEF/MS after
   IdeS cleavage and for the 11 charge variants after IdeS digestion with
   subsequent DTT reduction. In-depth analyses revealed the identities of
   all charge variants and pinpointed the causes of charge heterogeneity,
   which are in accord with those reported in the literature. The main
   sources of charge heterogeneity of cetuximab were identified as terminal
   lysine on the Fc domain (up to one on each single-chain Fc),
   glycolylneuraminic acid residues on the Fd' domain (up to two on each
   Fd'), and likely several deamidation species on the Fd' domain. No
   charge heterogeneity contribution was found from light chain. The
   in-depth characterization of complex charge variants for cetuximab
   demonstrates the remarkable capability of this middle up CIEF/MS
   approach. This novel workflow holds great potential for detecting and
   elucidating charge variants to help understand proteins with complex

Abstract = {In this paper, we present a visual-programming environment for teaching
   and research referred to as ``MTES{''}. MTES(Multimedia Education
   System) is the system designed to support both lecture and laboratory
   experiment simultaneously in one environment. It provides tools to
   prepare online teaching materials for the lecture and the experiment. It
   also provides a suitable teaching environment where lecturers can
   present the online teaching materials effectively and demonstrate new
   image processing concepts by showing real examples. In the same teaching
   environment, students can carry out experiments interactively by
   following the online instruction prepared by lecturer. In addition to
   support for the image processing education, MTES is also designed to
   assist research and application development with visual-programming
   environment. By supporting both teaching and research, MTES provides an
   easy bridge between learning and developing applications.},

Abstract = {Mapping rice area is a critical resource planning task in many South
   Asia countries where rice is the primary crop. Remote-sensing-based
   methods typically rely on domain knowledge, such as crop calendar and
   crop phenology, and supervised classification with ground truth samples.
   Applying such methods on Google Earth engine (GEE) has been proven
   effective, especially at large scale owing to the comprehensive and
   up-to-date data catalog and massive server-side processing power.
   However, writing scripts through the code editor requires users to
   program in JavaScript and understand GEE application programming
   interface (API), which can be challenging for many researchers. Thus,
   this article presents a GEE-based web application that aims to eliminate
   the programming requirements for data selection, preprocessing, and
   visualizations so that users can easily produce rice maps and refine
   ground truth collections through intuitive graphical user interfaces
   (GUI). This software includes three submodule apps, namely the ground
   truth collection app, threshold-based rice mapping app, and
   classification-based rice mapping app. Users can customize data
   processing flow using GUI designed with Bootstrap, and the backend
   server uses GEE Python API, and a Google service account for
   authentication to execute the workflow on Google cloud servers. The
   experiment shows that both the overall accuracy and Kappa scores of the
   mapping result are higher than 0.9, which suggests that RiceMapEngine
   can significantly reduce the complexity and time costs it takes to
   produce the accurate rice area maps and meet the demands of real-world
   stakeholders.},

Abstract = {Understanding species-habitat relationships is vital to successful
   conservation, but the tools used to communicate species-habitat
   relationships are often poorly suited to the information needs of

   translating a statistical species-habitat model, a regression analysis
   relating ring-necked pheasant abundance to landcover, into an
   interactive online tool. The Pheasant Habitat Simulator combines the
   analytical power of the R programming environment with the user-friendly
   Shiny web interface to create an online platform in which wildlife
   professionals can explore the effects of variation in local landcover on
   relative pheasant habitat suitability within spatial scales relevant to
   individual wildlife managers. Our tool allows users to virtually
   manipulate the landcover composition of a simulated space to explore how
   changes in landcover may affect pheasant relative habitat suitability,
   and guides users through the economic tradeoffs of landscape changes. We
   offer suggestions for development of similar interactive applications
   and demonstrate their potential as innovative science delivery tools for
   diverse professional and public audiences.},

Title = {TubeDB: An on-demand processing database system for climate station data},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& GEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {146},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Geographers, ecologists, and other environmental scientists are
   typically required to utilise non-continuous measurements from various
   types of sensors as part of their research activities. However, data
   management and processing require advanced computer skills and specific
   knowledge of the measurement sensors.
   Here, we present the Tube Database (TubeDB), an easy-to-operate software
   system to archive, quality control, query, and further process
   time-series data in an efficient manner. Data are imported by loading
   any unprocessed raw formats as recorded by climate stations into TubeDB.
   When a user requests data, a query to an on-demand processing unit is
   created that builds an individual processing flow with the raw data as a
   source. The processing flow builds on the typical preparation steps for
   time-series data, such as temporal aggregation, quality checks, and the
   interpolation of missing values and transformations. The primary user
   interface is a web-based application to allow easy access, rapid
   visualisations of time-series within seconds, and powerful
   product-export functionality. We also provide an R package (rTubeDB) for
   seamless connection to the R programming environment.
   TubeDB enables data requesters to assemble individually processed sets
   of time-series within a web-browser without requiring sensor-specific
   knowledge or experience in time-series processing. This complements
   existing time-series databases, which miss climate data-specific
   processing and visualisation capabilities. As a self-contained
   application with an embedded database and webserver, TubeDB has both low
   hardware demands and low installation complexity. TubeDB enables easy
   access to time-series data for a wide range of non computer scientists
   and will be useful for many research activities.},

Title = {Terrain Analysis in Google Earth Engine: A Method Adapted for
   High-Performance Global-Scale Analysis},
Journal = {ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Terrain analysis is an important tool for modeling environmental
   systems. Aiming to use the cloud-based computing capabilities of Google
   Earth Engine (GEE), we customized an algorithm for calculating terrain
   attributes, such as slope, aspect, and curvatures, for different
   resolution and geographical extents. The calculation method is based on
   geometry and elevation values estimated within a 3 x 3 spheroidal
   window, and it does not rely on projected elevation data. Thus, partial
   derivatives of terrain are calculated considering the great circle
   distances of reference nodes of the topographic surface. The algorithm
   was developed using the JavaScript programming interface of the online
   code editor of GEE and can be loaded as a custom package. The algorithm
   also provides an additional feature for making the visualization of
   terrain maps with a dynamic legend scale, which is useful for mapping
   different extents: from local to global. We compared the consistency of
   the proposed method with an available but limited terrain analysis tool
   of GEE, which resulted in a correlation of 0.89 and 0.96 for aspect and
   slope over a near-global scale, respectively. In addition to this, we
   compared the slope, aspect, horizontal, and vertical curvature of a
   reference site (Mount Ararat) to their equivalent attributes estimated
   on the System for Automated Geospatial Analysis (SAGA), which achieved a
   correlation between 0.96 and 0.98. The visual correspondence of TAGEE
   and SAGA confirms its potential for terrain analysis. The proposed
   algorithm can be useful for making terrain analysis scalable and adapted
   to customized needs, benefiting from the high-performance interface of
   GEE.},

Abstract = {We live and work in an era when seemingly every waking minute brings an
   invitation to visit yet another site on the World Wide Web. Inundated
   with calls to check out www.whatever.com, we can easily, lose sight of
   the fact that the birth of the Web is part of our very recent history.
   And notwithstanding the proliferation of personal and corporate vanity
   pages on the Web, this world of hyperlinks and hot spots has brought
   about dramatic changes in the means by which many individuals and
   organizations communicate, work, and trade. For new-products
   professionals interested in the processes that give rise to radical
   innovations, what lessons can be learned from the development of the
   World Wide Web?
   To gain insight into the process that resulted in the development of the
   first Web browser and Web sewer software, Ari-Pekka Hameri and Markus
   Nordberg examined project proposals, e-mail exchanges, and other
   documentation, and they interviewed key personnel who were involved in
   the process. From this research, they were able to document the process
   and the environmental constraints that shaped the development and
   diffusion of the tools and technologies that form the foundation of the
   World Wide Web.
   Although a staggeringly diverse range of Web-related services and
   applications have surfaced during the past few years, the original Web
   tools and technologies were targeted for a relatively small, focused
   community of researchers. Specifically, the origins of the World Wide
   Web are found in efforts aimed at meeting the information-sharing needs
   of researchers in the realm of high-energy physics. This far-flung group
   required a global network that could facilitate the interchange of
   documents stored in diverse formats on a wide variety of computing
   platforms.
   Meeting those needs required neither excessive R\&D investments nor
   radically new core technologies. Instead, the solution involved the
   integration of existing technologies-networking tools and protocols,
   document formats, and desktop applications and development tools-by an
   innovator who had both the necessary vision and firsthand knowledge of
   the practical benefits that were needed. From a management perspective,
   perhaps the key lesson learned involves giving R\&D personnel both the
   freedom and the support to initiate new projects and studies. (C) 1998

Abstract = {With the upcoming era of Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp) new demands on
   software engineering will arise. Fundamental needs for constructing user
   interfaces (UIs) in the context of UbiComp were identified and the
   subsumed results of a survey with special focus on model based user
   interface development environments (MB-UIDEs) are presented in this
   paper. It can be stated, that none of the examined systems is suitable
   for all the needs. Therefore a new architecture based on the Arch model
   is proposed, that supports the special UbiComp requirements. This
   layered architecture provides the desired flexibility with respect to
   different implementation techniques and UI modalities. It was
   implemented in a user interface development environment called Vesuf.
   Its usability was approved within the Global Info project {[}20], where
   heterogeneous services had to be integrated in a web portal.},

Abstract = {As information technology projects are creeping, it is essential to
   manage and maintain those projects using various project management
   tools. Most of the project management tools are designed to cater to the
   requirements which are laid down by the industry, but creating the
   project management tool from scratch is a cumbersome job for the IT
   industry thus most of the IT industries are now focusing of designing
   web services which can be consumed by the project management companies
   at large based on the requirement of the project selected web services
   can be consumed by the enterprise requesting the project management
   modules. As the number of projects is creeping and the same codes are
   being used in different projects, the code archive must be maintained,
   and the software should help the stakeholders using the software
   development tools to keep track of the reusability of the code. So that
   the efficiency of the project can be improved Some of the project
   management services such as task scheduling and resource allocation to
   the project can be recursively used and data repository can help in
   collection of relevant data items in the pool of the web services and
   segregate the information based on the project name and requirement of
   the project there is no need to rewrite these web services from scratch.
   Thus, such comprehensive web services can be grouped can and can be
   consumed by the enterprises as and when required for their project
   management activity. Archiving the project web services will help the
   project managers and the team members to run the web services live and
   will help the developers to contribute to development only on the
   required web service development environments.},

Title = {Studying the consistency of star ratings and reviews of popular free

Journal = {EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {7-32},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Nowadays, many developers make their mobile apps available on multiple
   platforms (e.g., Android and iOS). However, maintaining several versions
   of a cross-platform app that is built natively (i.e., using
   platform-specific tools) is a complicated task. Instead, developers can
   choose to use hybrid development tools, such as PhoneGap, to build
   hybrid apps. Hybrid apps are based on a single codebase across
   platforms. There exist two ways to use a hybrid development tool to
   build a hybrid app that runs on multiple platforms: (1) using web
   technologies (i.e., HTML, Javascript and CSS) and (2) in a common
   language, which is then converted to native code. We study whether these
   hybrid development tools achieve their main purpose: delivering an app
   that is perceived similarly by users across platforms. Prior studies
   show that users refer to star ratings and user reviews, when deciding to
   download an app. Given the importance of star ratings and user reviews,
   we study whether the usage of a hybrid development tool assists app
   developers in achieving consistency in the star ratings and user reviews
   across multiple platforms. We study 68 hybrid app-pairs, i.e., apps that
   exist both in the Google Play store and Apple App store. We find that 33
   out of 68 hybrid apps do not receive consistent star ratings across
   platforms. We run Twitter-LDA on user reviews and find that the star
   ratings of the reviews that discuss the same topic could be up to three
   times as high across platforms. Our findings suggest that while hybrid
   apps are better at providing consistent star ratings and user reviews
   when compared to cross-platform apps that are built natively, hybrid
   apps do not guarantee such consistency. Hence, developers should not
   solely rely on hybrid development tools to achieve consistency in the
   star ratings and reviews that are given by users of their apps. In
   particular, developers should track closely the ratings and reviews of
   their apps across platforms, so that they can act accordingly when
   platform-specific issues arise.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Abstract = {Background: EEG-driven research is paramount in
   cognitive-neuropsychological studies, as it provides a non-invasive
   window to the underlying neural mechanisms of cognition and behavior. A
   myriad collection of software and hardware frameworks has been developed
   to alleviate some of the technical barriers involved in EEG-driven
   research. Methods: we propose an integrated development environment
   which encompasses the entire technical ``data-collection pipeline{''} of
   cognitive-neuropsychological research, including experiment design, data
   acquisition, data exploration and analysis in a state-of-the-art user
   interface. Our framework is based on a unique integration between a
   python-based web framework, time-oriented databases and object-based
   data schemes. Results: we demonstrated our framework with the recording
   and analysis of an n-Back task completed by 15 elderly (ages 50 to 80)
   participants. This case study demonstrates the highly utilized nature of
   our integrated framework with a challenging target population.
   Furthermore, our results may provide new insights into the correlation
   between brain activity and working memory performance in elderly people,
   who are prone to experience accelerated decline in executive prefrontal
   cortex functioning. Conclusion: our framework extends the range of
   EEG-driven experimental methods for assessing cognition available for
   cognitive-neuroscientists, allowing them to concentrate on the creative
   part of their work instead of technical aspects.},

   Systems},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {39},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The clinical pathway (CP) as a novel medical management schema is
   beneficial for reducing the length of stay, decreasing heath care costs,
   standardizing clinical activities, and improving medical quality.
   However, the practicability of CPs is limited by the complexity and
   expense of adding the standard functions of electronic CPs to existing
   electronic medical record (EMR) systems. The purpose of this study was
   to design and develop an independent clinical pathway (ICP) system that
   is sharable with different EMR systems. An innovative knowledge base
   pattern was designed with separate namespaces for global knowledge,
   local knowledge, and real-time instances. Semantic web technologies were
   introduced to support knowledge sharing and intelligent reasoning. The
   proposed system, which was developed in a Java integrated development
   environment, achieved standard functions of electronic CPs without
   modifying existing EMR systems and integration environments in
   hospitals. The interaction solution between the pathway system and the
   EMR system simplifies the integration procedures with other hospital
   information systems. Five categories of transmission information were
   summarized to ensure the interaction process. Detailed procedures for
   the application of CPs to patients and managing exceptional alerts are
   presented by explicit data flow analysis. Compared to embedded pathway
   systems, independent pathway systems feature greater feasibility and
   practicability and are more advantageous for achieving the normalized
   management of standard CPs.},

Journal = {NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS},

Volume = {541},
Pages = {132-137},

Abstract = {The association between insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) gene
   polymorphisms and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk has been widely
   reported, but results were somewhat controversial. To assess the
   association between IDE polymorphisms and AD risk, a meta-analysis was
   performed. We systematically reviewed relevant studies retrieved by
   PubMed, Embase, AlzGene, CNKI and Web of Science. Finally, 8 articles
   were identified for rs3758505 polymorphism and 5 for rs1832196
   polymorphism. The pooled ORs were performed for all the four genetic
   models. Subgroup analysis was also performed by ethnicity. Results
   suggested that rs3758505 polymorphism was unlikely to be associated with
   genetic susceptibility of AD based on the current published studies.
   However, for the rs1832196 polymorphism, significant association with AD
   was found by the dominant model in overall and subgroup analysis.
   However, larger scale association studies are necessary to further
   validate the association of IDE polymorphisms with sporadic AD risk and
   to define potential gene-gene interactions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland

Title = {An adaptive fault detector strategy for scientific workflow scheduling
   based on improved differential evolution algorithm in cloud},
Journal = {APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {99},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {With the increasing popularity and acceptance of cloud computing, it is
   being applied in services like executing large-scale applications, where
   cloud environment is selected by the scientific associations to easily
   execute the computation intensive workflows. However, cloud computing
   can have higher failure rates due to the larger number of servers and
   components filled with the intensive workloads. These failures may lead
   to the unavailability of virtual machines (VMs) for computation. Hence,
   this issue of fault occurrences can be tolerated by adopting an
   effective and efficient fault tolerant strategy. The goal of our
   research in this paper is to develop an adaptive fault detector strategy
   based on Improved Differential Evolution (IDE) algorithm in cloud
   computing that can minimize the energy consumption, the makespan, the
   total cost and, at the same time, tolerate up faults when scheduling
   scientific workflows. This proposed work applies an adaptive
   network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) prediction model to
   proactively control resource load fluctuation that increases the failure
   prediction accuracy before fault/failure occurrence. In addition, it
   applies a reactive fault tolerance technique for when a processor fails
   and the scheduler must allocate a new VM to execute the workflow tasks.
   The experimental results show that compared with existing techniques,
   the proposed approach significantly improves the overall scheduling
   performance, achieves a higher degree of fault tolerance with high
   HyperVolume (HV) compared with the ICFWS, IDE, and ACO algorithms,
   minimizes the makespan, the energy consumption and task fault ratio, and
   reduces the total cost. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A wavelet fuzzy neural network using asymmetric membership function
   (WFNN-AMF) with improved differential evolution (IDE) algorithm is
   proposed in this study to control a six-phase permanent magnet
   synchronous motor (PMSM) for an electric power steering (EPS) system.
   First, the dynamics of a steer-by-wire EPS system and a six-phase PMSM
   drive system are described in detail. Moreover, the WFNN-AMF controller,
   which combines the advantages of wavelet decomposition, fuzzy logic
   system, and asymmetric membership function (AMF), is developed to
   achieve the required control performance of the EPS system for the
   improvement of stability of the vehicle and the comfort of the driver.
   Furthermore, the online learning algorithm of WFNN-AMF is derived using
   back-propagation method. However, degenerated or diverged responses will
   be resulted due to the inappropriate selection of small or large
   learning rates of the WFNN-AMF. Therefore, an IDE algorithm is proposed
   to online adapt the learning rates of WFNN-AMF. In addition, a 32-bit
   floating-point digital signal processor, TMS320F28335, is adopted for
   the implementation of the proposed intelligent controlled EPS system.
   Finally, the feasibility of the proposed WFNN-AMF controller with IDE
   for the EPS system is verified through experimental results.},

Abstract = {The partners in the Trilateral Euregio Cluster (TEC) are implementing
   and developing Remote Participation technologies that are expected to
   support a joint research programme on the experimental facility
   TEXTOR-94. A common TEC architecture for our heterogeneous data
   acquisition and storage systems is seen to be one of the major issues.
   As a consequence, legacy systems will be affected and have to be
   upgraded for optimised wide area network communication, platform
   independent data access and display. The object oriented redesign of the
   system to be described follows theses guidelines. The architecture of
   the system under development uses Java as programming environment and
   CORBA as Client/Server communication standard. It is described in this
   paper, how an operational Data Acquisition CAMAC subsystem of TEXTOR-94
   based on OpenVMS and Decnet communications could be redesigned into an
   open, object oriented architecture in a platform independent way. A
   suitable Web Browser is required on the client side without further
   installation of application software to run the server. CORBA static
   method invocations are used for the communication between the client and
   server. At the server side, there is only Java code on top of the
   existing commercial OpenVMS CAMAC device driver. A modular object
   oriented software design permitted to eliminate dependencies of the
   generic module levels from the underlying bus systems. Porting of the
   Java code to other platforms like Windows NT and Linux has proven to be
   successful. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Glycosylation is a common post-translational modification of therapeutic
   monoclonal antibodies produced in mammalian cells and is considered an
   important critical quality attribute (CQA), as it is known to impact
   efficacy, stability, half-life, and immunogenicity. For these reasons,
   glycosylation requires characterization and close monitoring during the
   manufacturing process. Due to the complexity of the glycosylation
   patterns, sophisticated analytical tools with high resolving power are
   required for the characterization of the glycoforms. This study
   describes, for the first time, the development and use of an online
   three-dimensional high-performance liquid chromatography/mass
   spectrometry (3D-HPLC/MS) approach for the monitoring of glycosylation
   patterns at the middle-up level. An immobilized IdeS-enzyme column was
   used in the first dimension for the digestion of mAbs in 10 min. Then,
   following an online reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) column
   reduction, the approximate to 25 kDa proteolytic fragments were analyzed
   using hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) coupled to MS. This
   novel analytical workflow demonstrated the ability to accurately profile
   glycosylated variants within a total run time of 95 min. To compare the
   performance of this analytical strategy with a conventional offline
   procedure (IdeS digestion x reduction-HILIC/MS), a proof of concept
   study using two mAbs is described here.},

Abstract = {Programming environments have evolved from purely text based to using
   graphical user interfaces, and now we see a move toward web-based
   interfaces, such as Jupyter. Web-based interfaces allow for the creation
   of interactive documents that consist of text and programs, as well as
   their output. The output can be rendered using web technology as, for
   example, text, tables, charts, or graphs. This approach is particularly
   suitable for capturing data analysis workflows and creating interactive
   educational material. This article describes SWISH, a web front-end for
   Prolog that consists of a web server implemented in SWI-Prolog and a
   client web application written in JavaScript. SWISH provides a web
   server where multiple users can manipulate and run the same material,
   and it can be adapted to support Prolog extensions. In this article we
   describe the architecture of SWISH, and describe two case studies of
   extensions of Prolog, namely Probabilistic Logic Programming and Logic
   Production System, which have used SWISH to provide tutorial sites.},

   for Data Librarians},
Journal = {EAI ENDORSED TRANSACTIONS ON SCALABLE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a novel type of library
   technology. AI technologies and the needs of data librarians are hybrid
   and symbiotic, because academic libraries must insert AI technologies
   into their information and data services. Library services need AI to
   interpret the context of big data.
   OBJECTIVES: In this context, we explore the use of the OpenAI Codex, a
   deep learning model trained on Python code from repositories, to
   generate code scripts for data librarians. This investigation examines
   the practices, models, and methodologies for obtaining code script
   insights from complex code environments linked to AI GPT technologies.
   METHODS: The proposed AI-powered method aims to assist data librarians
   in creating code scripts using Python libraries and plugins such as the
   integrated development environment PyCharm, with additional support from
   the Machinet AI and Bito AI plugins. The process involves collaboration
   between the data librarian and the AI agent, with the librarian
   providing a natural language description of the programming problem and
   the OpenAI Codex generating the solution code in Python.RESULTS: Five
   specific web-scraping problems are presented. The scripts demonstrate
   how to extract data, calculate metrics, and write the results to files.
   CONCLUSION: Overall, this study highlights the application of AI in
   assisting data librarians with code script creation for web scraping
   tasks. AI may be a valuable resource for data librarians dealing with
   big data challenges on the Web. The possibility of creating Python code
   with AI is of great value, as AI technologies can help data librarians
   work with various types of data sources. The Python code in Data Science
   web scraping projects uses a machine-learning model that can generate
   human-like code to help create and improve the library service for
   extracting data from a web collection. The ability of nonprogramming
   data librarians to use AI technologies facilitates their interactions
   with all types and data sources. The Python programming language has
   artificial intelligence modules, packages, and plugins such as the
   OpenAI Codex, which serialises automation and navigation in web browsers
   to simulate human behaviour on pages by entering passwords, selecting
   captcha options, collecting data, and creating different collections of
   datasets to be viewed.},

Abstract = {Ultrasonic backscatter and attenuation coefficients of a medium can be
   increased by the addition of solid, micron sized inhomogeneities. A
   potentially useful agent for ultrasonic contrast of liver images has
   been identified. Iodipamide ethyl ester (IDE) particles can be produced
   in the form of dense, relatively incompressible solids with high
   impedance mismatch to water. The chemical, biochemical, and
   pharmacological properties of the small, uniform diameter IDE particles
   permit safe intravenous injection followed by rapid accumulation by
   reticuloendothelial (RE) cells of the liver and spleen, and later
   elimination from these organs. Since the particles are phagocytized by
   RE cells, present in normal liver but not in tumors and many lesions,
   the selective enhancement of ultrasonic backscatter should improve
   detectability of lesions which are hypo- or iso-echoic compared to
   surrounding tissue. The mechanisms of particle-ultrasound interactions
   may be described by relative  motion attenuation, and scattering from a
   cloud of dense, incompressible spheres for the case of IDE particles in
   agar. Thus, values of attenuation and backscatter can be controlled by
   choice of ultrasound frequency and particle concentration and size. When
   the particles are accumulated in rat livers, additional mechanisms
   induce attenuation and backscatter in excess of that predicted by IDE in
   agar. This preliminary work demonstrates that solid, biocompatible
   particles may be useful as an ultrasonic contrast agent.},

   the framework and its workflow in four use cases analyzing data and
   enabling new services in health, automotive, and instruction. Our
   experience showed the benefits of the development tool, which is not

Abstract = {This study takes the digital campus construction planning of the high
   school as an example and determines the requirements of the postgraduate
   management information system under the digital campus environment
   through the analysis of the overall framework and technology of the
   digital campus. Combining the current situation of computer technology,
   network technology, and the actual situation of our university, the
   current mainstream B/S three-layer architecture is adopted, the web
   adopts the current popular Java Server Pages technology, and the struts
   framework connects to the Oracle backend database through the Java
   Database Connectivity interface to design the browser-side and
   server-side programs. The struts framework connects to the Oracle
   backend database through the Java Database Connectivity interface to
   design browser-side and serverside programs. The functional model and
   data flow model of the system were established through a detailed and
   effective analysis of the entire workflow of postgraduate students'
   training management during their school years. Then, the system
   analysis, design, and drawing of the swim lane diagram and data business
   flow diagram were carried out. The system was designed in detail in
   terms of system architecture, development tools, functional modules, and
   database design, and the core module of training program making in
   postgraduate training management was highlighted as an example to
   discuss the principles and methods in the construction of departmental
   business systems and informatization under the digital campus
   environment, and a flexible and efficient postgraduate management
   information system was realized. It standardizes the construction of
   data standardization in universities; does a good job of standardizing
   and normalizing information; improves the accuracy, validity, and
   real-time production of data collection and the real and safe unified
   management of historical data; and provides scientific and reasonable
   data support for the leadership to make relevant decisions.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we give a detailed account of the design principles and
   construction of activities designed for learning about the relationships
   between position, velocity and acceleration, and corresponding
   kinematics graphs. Our approach is model-based, that is, it focuses
   attention on the idea that students constructed their own models-in the
   form of programs-to formalise and thus extend their existing knowledge.
   In these activities, students controlled the movement of objects in a
   programming environment, recording the motion data and plotting
   corresponding position-time and velocity-time graphs. They shared their
   findings on a specially designed Web-based collaboration system, and
   posted cross-site challenges to which others could react. We present
   learning episodes that provide evidence of students making discoveries
   about the relationships between different representations of motion. We
   conjecture that these discoveries arose from their activity in building
   models of motion and their participation in classroom and online
   communities.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses how the benefits of cloud-based infrastructure can
   be harnessed for analytical workloads. Often, the software handling
   analytical workloads is not developed by a professional programmer but
   on an ad hoc basis by analysts in high-level programming environments
   such as R or MATLAB. The goal of this research is to allow Analysts to
   take an analytical job that executes on their personal workstations and
   with minimum effort execute it on cloud infrastructure and manage both
   the resources and the data required by the job. If this can be
   facilitated gracefully, then the Analyst benefits from on-demand
   resources, low maintenance cost and scalability of computing resources,
   all of which are offered by the cloud. In this paper, a Platform for
   Parallel R-based Analytics on the Cloud (P2RAC) that is placed between
   an Analyst and a cloud infrastructure is proposed and implemented. P2RAC
   offers a set of command-line tools for managing the resources, such as
   instances and clusters, the data and the execution of the software on
   the Amazon Elastic Computing Cloud infrastructure. Experimental studies
   are pursued using two parallel problems and the results obtained confirm
   the feasibility of employing P2RAC for solving large-scale analytical
   problems on the cloud.Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Title = {An Optimization Method for Integrating Educational Information Resources

Month = {JUL 19},
Abstract = {This paper adopts an edge computing approach to conduct in-depth
   research and analysis on the optimization of educational information
   resource integration and constructs an integrated teaching resource
   design model concerning the integrated teaching model, human-centered
   mobile learning resource design, and the interdisciplinary concept of
   physics subject teaching method. The learning field constituted by the
   model is divided into two parts, the explicit field and the potential
   field and then designs a five-stage teaching resource based on the
   model. A five-stage teaching resource development path was designed
   based on the model. Based on the cloud service center model, we propose
   a hierarchical mechanism for sharing educational information resources
   and analyze how each hierarchical entity constructs and shares resources
   and the rights and responsibilities of each hierarchical entity; we
   explain the meaning and functions of the personalized educational
   resource integrated development environment provided by the cloud
   service center for users. The dynamic evaluation model of the value of
   educational information resources is summarized and proposed for the
   resource exchange behavior in the sharing of educational information
   resources, and the significance of the calculation method of resource
   value, parameter values, and resource value difference for resource
   sharing is introduced. Firstly, the mechanism for coconstruction of
   educational information resources at different levels is proposed, and
   the construction tasks of subjects at different levels in the process of
   coconstruction and sharing of resources are elaborated. The sharing
   mechanism of educational information resources covering the
   regularization system, evaluation mechanism, incentive mechanism,
   problem handling mechanism, and supporting service mechanism is
   proposed, and a dynamic evaluation model of the value of educational
   information resources is designed to improve the enthusiasm of the
   coconstruction and sharing subjects.},

Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {209-271},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Data sets in large applications are often too massive to fit completely
   inside the computer's internal memory. The resulting input/output
   communication (or I/O) between fast internal memory and slower external
   memory (such as disks) can be a major performance bottleneck. In this
   article we survey the state of the art in the design and analysis of
   external memory (or EM) algorithms and data structures, where the goal
   is to exploit locality in order to reduce the I/O costs. We consider a
   variety of EM paradigms for solving hatched and online problems
   efficiently in external memory. For the batched problem of sorting and
   related problems such as permuting and fast Fourier transform, the key
   paradigms include distribution and merging. The paradigm of disk
   striping offers an elegant way to use multiple disks in parallel. For
   sorting, however, disk striping can be nonoptimal with respect to I/O,
   so to gain further improvements we discuss distribution and merging
   techniques for using the disks independently. We also consider useful
   techniques for batched EM problems involving matrices (such as matrix
   multiplication and transposition), geometric data (such as finding
   intersections and constructing convex hulls), and graphs (such as list
   ranking, connected components, topological sorting, and shortest paths).
   In the online domain, canonical EM applications include dictionary
   lookup and range searching. The two important classes of indexed data
   structures are based upon extendible hashing and B-trees. The paradigms
   of filtering and bootstrapping provide a convenient means in online data
   structures to make effective use of the data accessed from disk. We also
   reexamine some of the above EM problems in slightly different settings,
   such as when the data items are moving, when the data items are
   variable-length (e.g., text strings), or when the allocated amount of
   internal memory can change dynamically. Programming tools and
   environments are available for simplifying the EM programming task.
   During the course of the survey, we report on some experiments in the
   domain of spatial databases using the TPIE system (transparent parallel
   I/O programming environment). The newly developed EM algorithms and data
   structures that incorporate the paradigms we discuss are significantly
   faster than methods currently used in practice.},

Volume = {16},

Abstract = {The communication of web services is typically organized through public
   APIs, which rely on a common data model shared among all system
   components. Over time, this data model must be changed in order to
   accommodate new or changing requirements, and the system components
   including the data they are operating on must be migrated. In practice,
   however, not all the affected components can be migrated instantly and
   at the same time. A common approach is to plan data model changes in a
   backward compatible fashion, which eventually causes serious maintenance
   problems and is a common cause of technical debt. In this paper, we
   propose an alternative solution to this problem by using a translation
   layer serving as a round-trip migration service which is responsible for
   the lossless forth-and-back translation of object-oriented data model
   instances of different versions. We present a framework which offers a
   version-aware interface definition language (IDL) for APIs, a typed
   JavaScript-based language for defining migration functions using the IDL
   definition, and a run-time environment for executing migrations. This is
   bundled into an integrated development environment assisting developers
   in implementing migration functions. From a methodological point of
   view, the development of round-trip migrations is supported by a catalog
   which comprises a set of typical data model evolution scenarios along
   with corresponding suitable round-trip migration strategies. We validate
   our framework by carrying out an extensive evaluation including a
   systematic assessment of expressiveness using our catalog,
   micro-benchmarking the performance of round-trip migrations, as well as
   a practical application in a case study of a real-world e-commerce web
   application obtained from an industrial partner.},

Abstract = {Industry has put forward demands on cross enterprises collaboration
   including various resources sharing. In order to meet these demands,
   much has been done to realize cross-border collaboration. However, after
   analyzing the unique features of manufacturing resources and the limits
   of existing technologies like Internet, EC, ASP and Web-based
   design/manufacturing, which adopt many new Web technologies like Web
   mark-up languages, Web-based client-server programming tools and
   distributed object modeling methods, it is concluded that all these
   technologies could not meet industrial demands on dynamic sharing of
   various resources. Therefore grid manufacturing is put forward to meet
   these demands. According to the features of resources to be shared and
   the technologies to be used, grid manufacturing distinguishes itself
   from Web-based manufacturing by providing the transient services and by
   achieving the interoperability. The differences and relationship between
   grid manufacturing and grid computing are yielded. At last, a Web

Abstract = {This article presents how various on-site and remote computing resources
   are combined into a framework to support teaching parallel and
   distributed computing (PDC) at the undergraduate level. The combination
   of these resources enables the delivery of PDC programming, system, and
   architectural concepts via a browser-based common interface (JupyterHub)
   and a single programming environment (Python and its supported
   libraries). This also allows lecturers and students to focus more on the
   principles of PDC and less on the technicalities of native languages for
   different platforms. We describe how this framework can support a
   comprehensive set of PDC course modules, including lectures,
   assignments, and projects, for a full semester junior-level class.
   Adoption of this framework in various teaching environments at Clemson
   University has received positive feedback from both instructors and
   participants. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Abstract = {Optimal coordination of directional overcurrent relays (DOCRs) in
   interconnected power systems is a highly constrained, non-convex and
   non-linear optimisation problem. In this study, use of a series of
   linear programming (LP) problems in a variable neighbourhood search
   (VNS) framework is proposed, in which pickup current settings can be
   considered either as continuous or discrete variables. Therefore, the
   proposed hybrid algorithm (VNS-LP) is suitable for coordination
   problem-solving in a network with different types of DOCRs. Furthermore,
   two versions of the VNS algorithm are proposed, the first of which is
   very easy to implement, while, the other is somewhat more sophisticated,
   and at the same time much faster and possibly suitable for online
   coordination in smart grids applications. One advantage of the second
   algorithm is that it relies only on elementary arithmetic and requires
   low RAM, which makes it implementable in any low-level programming
   environment. This, in turn, can increase the interoperability, which is
   of crucial importance when automating tasks. The efficiency of the
   proposed algorithm was investigated in several test systems. Numerical
   results indicate that the two proposed approaches outperform the
   previous methods. Moreover, the coordination problem is solved in a
   reasonably short time using a faster approach.},

Abstract = {The paper describes JessGUI, a graphical user interface developed on top
   of the Jess expert system shell. The central idea of the JessGUI project
   was to make building, revising, updating, and testing Jess-based expert
   systems easier, more flexible, and more user friendly. There are many
   other expert system building tools providing a rich and comfortable
   integrated development environment to expert system builders. However,
   they are all either commercial or proprietary products. Jess and JessGUI
   are open-source freeware, and yet they are well suited for building even
   complex expert system applications, both stand-alone and Web-based ones.
   An important feature of JessGUI is its capability of saving knowledge
   bases in XML format (in addition to the original Jess format), thus
   making them potentially easy to interoperate with other knowledge bases
   on the Internet. Jess and JessGUI are also used as practical knowledge
   engineering tools to support both introductory and advanced university
   courses on expert systems. The paper presents design details of JessGUI,
   explains its links with the underlying Jess knowledge representation and
   reasoning tools, and shows examples of using JessGUI in expert system
   development. It also discusses some of the current efforts in extending
   Jess/JessGUI in order to provide intelligent features originally not
   supported in Jess. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The technology that integrates various types of Web contents to build a

   a uniform and flexible programmatic interface for integration of
   different Web contents is unavoidable. In this paper, we propose an
   approach that can be used to analyze Web applications automatically and
   reuse the information of Web applications through the programmatic
   interface we designed. Our approach can support the flexible integration
   of Web applications, Web services and Web feeds. In our experiments, we
   use a large number of Web pages from different types of Web applications
   and achieve the integration by the proposed programmatic interfaces. The
   experimental results show that our approach brings to the end-users a

Volume = {26},

Abstract = {The International Association for Mathematical Geology (IAMG) has been
   operating an Internet site since 1994. The site was initially started as
   an FTP service for computer program code published in Computers \&
   Geosciences followed by the establishment of a WWW site. The
   establishment of the FTP site required consideration for operating
   system support and data archive standards support. The implementation of
   the WWW site enabled the IAMG to provide information and services for
   all Internet users. Analysis of the access logs for both the FTP and WWW
   services have shown that there has been a steady increase in access to
   the programs and IAMG information. Long-term archival issues include
   dealing with programs available only in binary (executable) form and
   long-term support of compression formats (i.e. zip, tar). As computer
   programming environments become increasingly sophisticated the journal
   is faced with the challenge of insuring that the computer program code
   is useful to geoscientists. The Internet programming environment is
   becoming increasingly popular as a means of creating program code that
   is independent of user platform type and also allows programmers to
   maintain control over the use and development of their code on one site.
   As this type of environment develops the IAMG FTP site has started to
   create URL links to the program source sites. Computers viruses are an
   issue which requires the attention of all IAMG users. The Computers \&
   Geosciences Silver CD project has been started which will contain all
   program code (raster or ASCII text) form for volumes 1-25. Future
   services on the IAMG web site will include a searchable membership
   database, list servers for special interest groups within the IAMG and
   constant updating of useful services and links to the IAMG membership.

Abstract = {Grids collect the geographically distributed heterogeneous resources and
   use their aggregated power to solve large-scale scientific problems. In
   order to aggregate scientific computing libraries and parallel
   programming environments, a Grid computing agent is introduced. The
   agent acts as the middleware of grid computing. It coordinates several
   parallel programming environments to support the heterogeneous parallel
   computing and integrates scientific computing libraries to deliver the
   efficient solution of large problems. The agent consists of four
   modules: (1) parallel compilation module for compiling, debugging, and
   distributing codes. (2) parallel execution module for resource
   scheduling, application program execution and result redirection. (3)
   scientific computing module as a graphical user interface which is
   implemented by integrating Matlab and NetSolve {[}1]. (4) resource
   management module providing a single system image for the whole system.
   Based on the agent, a web portal is developed which provides a uniform
   service entry for end users. This approach improves the system usability
   significantly.},

   Front-End for High Performance Computing},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 17},
Abstract = {Complex computational pipelines are becoming a staple of modern
   scientific research. Often these pipelines are resource intensive and
   require days of computing time. In such cases, it makes sense to run
   them over high performance computing (HPC) clusters where they can take
   advantage of the aggregated resources of many powerful computers. In
   addition to this, researchers often want to integrate their workflows
   into their own web servers. In these cases, software is needed to manage
   the submission of jobs from the web interface to the cluster and then
   return the results once the job has finished executing. We have
   developed the Job Management System (JMS), a workflow management system
   and web interface for high performance computing (HPC). JMS provides
   users with a user-friendly web interface for creating complex workflows
   with multiple stages. It integrates this workflow functionality with the
   resource manager, a tool that is used to control and manage batch jobs
   on HPC clusters. As such, JMS combines workflow management functionality
   with cluster administration functionality. In addition, JMS provides
   developer tools including a code editor and the ability to version tools
   and scripts. JMS can be used by researchers from any field to build and
   run complex computational pipelines and provides functionality to
   include these pipelines in external interfaces. JMS is currently being
   used to house a number of bioinformatics pipelines at the Research Unit
   in Bioinformatics (RUBi) at Rhodes University. JMS is an open-source
   project and is freely available at https://github.com/RUBi-ZA/JMS.},

Abstract = {Collecting, storing, and providing access to Internet of Things (IoT)
   data are fundamental tasks to many smart city projects. However,
   developing and integrating IoT systems is still a significant barrier to
   entry. In this work, we share insights on the development of cloud data
   storage and visualization tools for IoT smart city applications using
   flood warning as an example application. The developed system
   incorporates scalable, autonomous, and inexpensive features that allow
   users to monitor real-time environmental conditions, and to create
   threshold-based alert notifications. Built in Amazon Web Services (AWS),
   the system leverages serverless technology for sensor data backup, a
   relational database for data management, and a graphical user interface
   (GUI) for data visualizations and alerts. A RESTful API allows for easy
   integration with web-based development environments, such as Jupyter
   notebooks, for advanced data analysis. The system can ingest data from
   LoRaWAN sensors deployed using The Things Network (TTN). A cost analysis
   can support users' planning and decision-making when deploying the
   system for different use cases. A proof-of-concept demonstration of the
   system was built with river and weather sensors deployed in a flood
   prone suburban watershed in the city of Charlottesville, Virginia.},

Abstract = {Nowadays there are several frameworks that permit the conversion between
   SOAP and RESTful web services. However, none of these frameworks defines
   a high-level characterization of the interchange process, hindering full
   understanding of this process. This paper provides a metamodel-based
   approach that formalizes the conversion between SOAP and RESTful web
   services, clarifying this process. This approach can be used for guiding
   the ranslation process in forthcoming conversion frameworks and the
   publication of services in IDEs. In order to characterize the conversion
   mechanism three MOF metamodels are defined: SOAP, RESTful and
   intermediate SOA metamodels. This intermediate metamodel is used as a
   bridge between the other two metamodels. QVT Relations transformation
   rules between SOAP, RESTful and SOA metamodels are defined for a formal
   characterization of the transformation process. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {The solubility of the RbCl-CsCl-H2O ternary system has been investigated
   at the temperature range from 298.15 to 348.15 K by two different
   methods, namely, the Flow-Cloud-Point (FCP) method and the Isothermal
   Dissolve Equilibrium (IDE) method. The measured solubility for this
   ternary system at 298.15 K by FCP method is consistent with the reported
   result in literature. The measured solubility results for this ternary
   system at 323.15 K by the FCP and IDE, two different methods that are
   consistent with each other, which indicated the results are more
   reliable. Meanwhile, the measured liquid-wet solid-solid lines proved
   that the equilibrium solid phases are two types of solid solutions
   (Rb,Cs)Cl-(ss) and (Cs,Rb)Cl-(ss) rather than pure salts (RbCl and CsCl)
   reported in literature. For the first time, the solubility of the
   RbCl-CsCl-H2O ternary system at 308.15 and 348.15 K has been measured by

Title = {Visual Programming Environments for End -User Development of intelligent

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTER LANGUAGES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {58},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Robots are becoming interactive and robust enough to be adopted outside
   laboratories and in industrial scenarios as well as interacting with
   humans in social activities. However, the design of engaging robot -
   based applications requires the availability of usable, flexible and
   accessible development frameworks, which can be adopted and mastered by
   researchers and practitioners in social sciences and adult end users as
   a whole. This paper surveys Visual Programming Environments aimed at
   enabling a paradigm fos- tering the so-called End -User Development of
   applications involving robots with social capabilities. The focus of
   this article is on those Visual Programming Environments that are
   designed to support social re- search goals as well as to cater for
   professional needs of people not trained in more traditional text -based
   computer programming languages. This survey excludes interfaces aimed at
   supporting expert program- mers, at allowing industrial robots to
   perform typical industrial tasks (such as pick and place operations),
   and at teaching children how to code. After having performed a
   systematic search, sixteen programming environments have been included
   in this survey. Our goal is two -fold: first, to present these software
   tools with their technical features and Authoring Artificial
   Intelligence modeling approaches, and second, to present open challenges
   in the development of Visual Programming Environments for end users and
   social researchers, which can be informative and valuable to the
   community. The results show that the most recent such tools are adopting
   distributed and Component -Based Software Engineering approaches and web
   technologies. However, few of them have been designed to enable the
   independence of end users from high-tech scribes. Moreover, findings
   indicate the need for (i) more objective and comparative evaluations, as
   well as usability and user experience studies with real end users; and
   (ii) validations of these tools for designing applications aimed at
   working ?in -the -wild? rather than only in laboratories and structured

Abstract = {As online learning has become an inevitable trend in the post-peak era
   of the COVID-19 pandemic, distributed pair programming (DPP) is gaining
   momentum in both education and industry. DDP serves as a collaborative
   programming approach and also benefits the development of computational
   thinking, a fundamental skill in today's world. This study conducted a
   systematic review of studies on DPP published after 2010 to understand
   the themes and factors that impact the team effectiveness of DPP and
   thus inform future research and practices on how to better leverage this
   approach for teaching and learning. The results showed that individual
   characteristics attracted major investigations in the selected 23
   studies, including prior programming experience, actual skill, perceived
   skill, gender, personality, time management, confidence, and
   self-esteem, with pair compatibility identified as a critical team
   design factor that significantly affects programmers' satisfaction.
   Although the feel-good factor in the team process was investigated, no
   significant impact was found. Under the team environment theme, we
   compared different opinions on the orientation (e.g., scripted roles)
   and the use of technology (e.g., integrated development environment
   tools). Future research should investigate how task structure influences
   team effectiveness of DPP and relates to computational thinking
   education. Additionally, because most studies were conducted in higher
   education contexts, more research in primary and secondary educational
   contexts is also needed.},

Abstract = {The flexibility demands in manufacturing are severe, e.g., for
   rapid-change-over to new product variants, while robots are flexible
   machines that potentially can be adapted to a large variety of
   production tasks. Task definitions such as explicit robot programs are
   hardly reusable from an application point-of-view. To improve the
   situation, a knowledge-based approach exploiting distributed declarative
   information and cloud computing offers many possibilities for knowledge
   exchange and reuse, and it has the potential to facilitate new business
   models for industrial solutions. However, there are many unresolved
   questions yet, e.g., those related to reliability, consistency, or legal
   responsibility. To investigate some of these issues, different
   knowledge-based architectures have been prototyped and evaluated by
   confronting the solution candidates with key application demands. The
   conclusion is that distributed cloud-based approaches offer many
   possibilities, but there is still a need for further research and better
   infrastructure before this approach can become industrially attractive.
   Note to Practitioners-It is possible to extend the capabilities of a
   robot system by providing online services. An example of such a service
   is an online library of robot applications, an app store, where robot
   programs can be downloaded and installed on the system with little
   effort from the user. Another is text analysis, that requires heavy
   computations but can provide a more natural user interaction.
   Experiences from several European projects with the goal to simplify
   robot usage/programming have resulted in a number of insights around the
   core challenges. For instance, providing application libraries in a
   traditional software sense is too limited when considering the necessary
   management of uncertainty (including human interaction, configuration of
   sensing, and learning). Robot programs are therefore better represented
   as distributable and compositional knowledge, together with supporting
   computational services. Since robot programming is time consuming and
   requires expertise, thus expensive, there is a need for good services
   that simplify this process. We see a need for coherent APIs in existing
   robot programming tools such that the desired app store can be added to
   the back-end of existing solutions.},

Title = {A Market-based Framework for Resource Management in Cloud Federation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GRID COMPUTING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A federated cloud is a form of the inter-cloud environment in which
   cloud service providers cooperate for better scalability and service
   provisioning. By communicating with other cloud providers and sharing
   resources, federated members gain more advantages from utilizing a
   comprehensive resource management system. There are different setups for
   federated clouds, in terms of federation formation and member
   interactions. Consequently, difficulties arise since resource management
   must be dealt with as a general entity. The current paper introduces a
   generic resource management framework for inter-federation resource
   management that can be used for a wide range of cloud federation models.
   By considering the federated cloud as a market for trading resources,
   the present study proposes a market-based framework to manage the
   various types of federated clouds. The main components of the proposed
   framework are based on market management models. This generic framework
   is able to cover a variety of centralized cloud federation models that
   divide the federated cloud life cycle into time slots. Finally, the
   present work introduces a resource management model which is compatible
   with the proposed framework. The model is implemented with Java and
   NetBeans IDE 8.2 and evaluated using the FederatedCloudSim 2.0 toolkit.
   The results are discussed in order to evaluate the proposed framework
   and the selected market algorithms.},

Title = {Hadoop-Based Painting Resource Storage and Retrieval Platform
   Construction and Testing},
Journal = {COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {MAY 7},
Abstract = {This paper adopts Hadoop to build and test the storage and retrieval
   platform for painting resources. This paper adopts Hadoop as the
   platform and MapReduce as the computing framework and uses Hadoop
   Distributed Filesystem (HDFS) distributed file system to store massive
   log data, which solves the storage problem of massive data. According to
   the business requirements of the system, this paper designs the system
   according to the process of web text mining, mainly divided into log
   data preprocessing module, log data storage module, log data analysis
   module, and log data visualization module. The core part of the system
   is the log data analysis module. The analysis of search keywords
   ranking, Uniform Resource Locator (URL), and user click relationship,
   URL ranking, and other dimensions are realized through data statistical
   analysis, and Canopy coarse clustering is performed first according to
   search keywords, and then K-means clustering is used for the results
   after Canopy clustering, and the calculation of cosine similarity is
   adopted to realize the grouping of users and build user portrait. The
   Hadoop development environment is installed and deployed, and functional
   and performance tests are conducted on the contents implemented in this
   system. The constructed private cloud platform for remote sensing image
   data can realize online retrieval of remote sensing image metadata and
   fast download of remote sensing image data and solve the problems in
   storage, data sharing, and management of remote sensing image data to a
   certain extent.},

Abstract = {Recently the World Wide Web has emerged as a platform for computer-based
   oral health records. Web-based patient records can make teledentistry an
   instant reality. Because an increasing number of dental care providers
   can access Web pages, traditional barriers to exchanging information are
   dropping. Web-based records also make cumulative, longitudinal patient
   records possible. Sophisticated security mechanisms can ensure the
   integrity and confidentiality of patient information. Because Web-based
   systems are simpler to install and configure, the cost of operating them
   may be reduced. However, their development is complex, difficult, and
   expensive because the Web was not developed as a programming environment
   Furthermore, the technologies underlying the Web are constantly
   evolving, forcing developers to continuously reengineer their systems.
   In addition, several policy questions, such as storage of and access to
   computer-based patient records, have to be answered. This article
   describes CMSWeb, a Web-based clinical information system implemented at
   Temple University School of Dentistry.},

Title = {Dynamic soft sensor modeling method fusing process feature information
   based on an improved intelligent optimization algorithm},
Journal = {CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {217},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {The lack of real-time and accurate melting index forecast model puts
   forward challenges to the online quality detection and control of the
   polypropylene industrial production. Meanwhile, the key process
   characteristics of dynamic and time delay are not fully and effectively
   integrated into the soft sensor model. Therefore, a novel dynamic soft
   sensing (DSS) modeling method using the orthogonal echo state network
   (OESN) based on the cumulative mutual information (CMI) threshold
   setting integrating an improved differential evolution algorithm (IDE)
   (OESN-CMI-IDE) is proposed. The mutual information of each candidate
   auxiliary variable relative to the dominant variable is calculated and
   sorted to determine the CMI threshold and select the corresponding
   auxiliary variable. Then an IDE algorithm is used to optimize the
   parameters of the OESN model, which has faster convergence, higher
   accuracy and stronger robustness than that of DE, self-adaptive DE
   (jDE), DE with time varying scale factor (DETVSF), line decreased
   inertia weight particle swarm optimization (LDPSO), flexible exponential
   inertia weight particle swarm optimization (FEPSO), and oscillating
   triangular inertia weight particle swarm optimization (OTPSO) in terms
   of evolutionary computing competition benchmark function tests. Finally,
   the proposed method is applied to predict the melt index in an actual
   polypropylene plant. The experimental results demonstrate that the
   prediction effect of the proposed method is better than that of the OESN
   model optimized by DE, jDE, DETVSF, LDPSO, FEPSO, OTPSO and the OESN
   model without optimization, which can escort the online monitoring and
   advanced control of the melt index in the propylene industry.},

Title = {MiniDeep: A Standalone AI-Edge Platform with a Deep Learning-Based
   MINI-PC and AI-QSR System},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In this paper, we present a new AI (Artificial Intelligence) edge
   platform, called ``MiniDeep{''}, which provides a standalone deep
   learning platform based on the cloud-edge architecture. This AI-Edge
   platform provides developers with a whole deep learning development
   environment to set up their deep learning life cycle processes, such as
   model training, model evaluation, model deployment, model inference,
   ground truth collecting, data pre-processing, and training data
   management. To the best of our knowledge, such a whole deep learning
   development environment has not been built before. MiniDeep uses Amazon
   Web Services (AWS) as the backend platform of a deep learning tuning
   management model. In the edge device, the OpenVino enables deep learning
   inference acceleration at the edge. To perform a deep learning life
   cycle job, MiniDeep proposes a mini deep life cycle (MDLC) system which
   is composed of several microservices from the cloud to the edge.
   MiniDeep provides Train Job Creator (TJC) for training dataset
   management and the models' training schedule and Model Packager (MP) for
   model package management. All of them are based on several AWS cloud
   services. On the edge device, MiniDeep provides Inference Handler (IH)
   to handle deep learning inference by hosting RESTful API (Application
   Programming Interface) requests/responses from the end device. Data
   Provider (DP) is responsible for ground truth collection and dataset
   synchronization for the cloud. With the deep learning ability, this
   paper uses the MiniDeep platform to implement a recommendation system
   for AI-QSR (Quick Service Restaurant) KIOSK (interactive kiosk)
   application. AI-QSR uses the MiniDeep platform to train an LSTM (Long
   Short-Term Memory)-based recommendation system. The LSTM-based
   recommendation system converts KIOSK UI (User Interface) flow to the
   flow sequence and performs sequential recommendations with food
   suggestions. At the end of this paper, the efficiency of the proposed
   MiniDeep is verified through real experiments. The experiment results
   have demonstrated that the proposed LSTM-based scheme performs better
   than the rule-based scheme in terms of purchase hit accuracy,
   categorical cross-entropy, precision, recall, and F1 score.},

Abstract = {A Web application's codebase is typically divided into a server side and

   developments like Node.js allow using JavaScript in a simple and
   efficient way also on the server side, but lack offering a common
   codebase for the entire Web application. In this article, we present the
   SWAG approach that aims at reducing development efforts and minimizing
   coding errors in order to make creating Web applications more
   efficiently. Based on our approach, we created the SWAC framework. It
   enables establishing a unified Web application codebase that provides
   both dynamic functionality and progressive enhancement by taking

Abstract = {Microservice architecture (MSA) is a paradigm to design and develop
   scalable distributed applications using loosely coupled, highly cohesive
   components that can be deployed independently. The applications that
   realize the MSA may contain thousands of services that together form the
   overall system. Microservices interact with each other by producing and
   consuming data. Deploying frequently communicating services to the same
   physical resource would reduce network utilization, which is vital for
   reducing costs and improving scalability. Since the physical resources
   have limited capacity, it is not always possible to deploy communicating
   services to the same resource. Therefore, automated efficient deployment
   alternatives need to be generated for MSA in the design phase. To
   address this problem, we proposed an algorithmic approach to generate
   efficient microservice deployment configurations to available cloud
   resources in our previous study. In this study, a tool (Micro-IDE) has
   been proposed to realize and evaluate this approach. The Micro-IDE tool
   has been validated using a case study inspired by the Spotify

Abstract = {This paper addresses several approaches to implementing web-based,
   three-dimensional (3-D), gee-referenced visualization. The discussion
   focuses on the relationship between multi-dimensional data sets and

   structure. Two models of data sets are addressed in this paper. One is
   the use of traditional 3-D data format such as 3-D Studio Max, Open
   Inventor 2.0, Vis5D and OBJ. The other is modelled by a web-based
   language such as VRML, Also, traditional languages such as C and C++, as
   well as web-based programming tools such as Java, Java3D and ActiveX,
   can be used for developing applications. The strengths and weaknesses of
   each approach are elaborated. Four practical solutions for using VRML
   and Java, Java and Java3D, VRML and ActiveX and Java wrapper classes
   (Java and C/C++), to develop applications are presented for web-based,
   real-time interactive and explorative visualization. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {This study looks at how human and social issues affect software

   positions software development as an activity within Information Systems

   address human and social issues they do so by considering either
   business organisations or software development environments separately
   but do not connect both contexts together. This research tries to build
   this connection through a model of social issues in software
   development. The model was generated from data collected from an
   interpretive online ethnography of virtual communities of software
   developers. The model of social issues complements Orlikowski's
   structurational model of enactment of technologies-in-practice and
   suggests that human and social issues that affect the production of
   software emerge from three different contexts: software development
   environment, software development practices and complex business

Title = {Web-centred end-user component modelling},
Journal = {FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {54},

Abstract = {This paper formally defines a web component model enabling end-user
   programmers to build component-based rich internet applications (RIAs)
   that are tailored to meet their particular needs. It is the product of a
   series of previously published papers. The formal definition in
   description logic verifies that the model is consistent and subsumes
   currently existing models. We demonstrate experimentally that it is more
   effective than the others.
   Current tools propose very disparate web component models, which are
   based on the appropriate invocation of service backends, overlooking
   user needs in order to exploit these services and resources in a
   friendly manner. We have proposed a web model based on a detailed study
   of existing tools, their pros and cons, limitations and key success
   factors that have enabled other web end-user development (WEUD)
   solutions to help end-user programmers to build software to support
   their needs. In this paper we have verified that the proposed model
   subsumes and is instantiated by the models of the other existing tools
   that we analysed, coming a step closer to the standardization of
   end-user centred RIAs and development environments. We have implemented
   a development tool, called EzWeb, to produce RIAs that implement the
   proposed model. This tool enables users to develop their application
   following the model's component structure based on end-user programming
   success factors. We report a statistical experiment in which users
   develop increasingly complex web software using the EzWeb tool
   generating RIAs that conform to the proposed component model, and other
   WEUD tools generating RIAs that conform to other models. This experiment
   confirms the applicability of the proposed model and demonstrates that
   more enduser programmers (EUPs) (users concerned with programming
   primarily for personal rather public use) successfully develop web
   solutions for complex problems using the EzWeb tool that implements the
   model, which is more efficient than existing tools that implement other
   models. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present a system referred to as ``Hello-Vision.{''}
   Hello-Vision is a software development environment that can be used in
   conjunction with research and application development in the area of
   image processing. It is an integrated environment that supports reusable
   image processing algorithm developments, systematic management of
   algorithms and related information. Hello-Vision's function is to
   simplify image processing applications using the algorithms and to
   provide an ideal environment for the education of practical image
   processing engineers. Hello-Vision adopts a true object-oriented
   approach supporting well-separated data classes similar to WE (Image
   Understanding Environment) classes. This process allows algorithm to be
   written by their functions without user interface programming by
   separating the interface layer from data processing functions. The
   user-defined functions are easily registered in the online algorithm
   management systems and treated as a system command. Hello-Vision is
   equipped with a visual programming environment where a user can easily
   create image- processing applications by manipulating visual command
   icons and user-defined function icons that are created automatically
   when they are registered. Hello-Vision also provides an ideal
   environment where instructors can register their lecture materials for
   image processing theory, which allows hands-on experimentation with
   Hello-Vision through user interaction.},

Title = {A LoRa sensor network for monitoring pastured livestock location and
   activity},
Journal = {TRANSLATIONAL ANIMAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Precision technologies for confinement animal agricultural systems have
   increased rapidly over the past decade, though precision technology
   solutions for pastured livestock remain limited. There are a number of
   reasons for this limited expansion of technologies for pastured animals,
   including networking availability and reliability, power requirements,
   and expense, among others. The objective of this work was to demonstrate
   a rapidly deployable long-range radio (LoRa) based, low-cost sensor
   suite that can be used to track location and activity of pastured
   livestock. The sensor is comprised of an inexpensive Arduino-compatible
   microprocessor, a generic MPU-9250 motion sensor which contains a 3-axis
   accelerometer, 3-axis magnetometer, and a 3-axis gyroscope, a generic
   GPS receiver, and a RFM95W generic LoRa radio. The microprocessor can be
   programmed flexibly using the open source Arduino IDE software to adjust
   the frequency of sampling, the data packet to send, and what conditions
   are needed to operate. The LoRa radio transmits to a Dragino LoRa
   gateway which can also be flexibly programmed through the Arduino IDE
   software to send data to local storage or, in cases where a web or
   cellular connection is available, to cloud storage. The sensor was
   powered using a USB cord connected to a 3,350 mAh lithium-ion battery
   pack. The Dragino gateway was programmed to upload data to the
   ThingSpeak IoT application programming interface for data storage,
   handling, and visualization. Evaluations showed minimal benefit
   associated with reducing sampling frequency as a strategy to preserve
   battery life. Packet loss ranged from 40\% to 60\%. In a 3 d evaluation
   on pastured sheep, the sensor suite was able to report GPS locations,
   inertial sensor readings, and temperature. Preliminary demonstrations of
   our system are satisfactory to detect animal location based on GPS data
   in real-time. This system has clear utility as a lower-cost strategy to
   deploy flexible, useful precision technologies for pasture-based
   livestock species.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},

Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Programming online judges (POJs) have been increasingly used in CS1
   classes, as they allow students to practice and get quick feedback. For
   instructors, it is a useful tool for creating assignments and exams.
   However, selecting problems in POJs is time consuming. First, problems
   are generally not organized based on topics covered in the CS1 syllabus.
   Second, assessing whether problems require similar effort to be
   completed and map onto the same topic is a subjective and
   expert-dependent task. The difficulty increases if the instructor must
   create variations of these assessments, e.g., to avoid plagiarism. Thus,
   here, we research how to support CS1 instructors in the task of
   selecting problems, to compose one-size-fits-all or personalized
   assignments/exams. Our solution is to propose a novel intelligent
   recommender system, based on a fine-grained data-driven analysis of the
   students' effort on solving problems in the integrated development
   environment of a POJ system, and automatic detection of topics for CS1
   problems, based on problem descriptions. Data collected from 2714
   students are processed to support, via our artificial intelligence (AI)
   method recommendations, the instructors' decision-making process. We
   evaluated our method against the state of the art in a simple blind
   experiment with CS1 instructors (N < 35). Results show that our
   recommendations are 88\% accurate, surpassing our baseline (p < 0.05).
   Finally, our work paves the way for novel POJ smart learning
   environments, wherein instructors define learning tasks
   (assignments/exams) supported by AI.},

   validate the presented model, the cloud user files data was considered
   and imported to the system as input. Then further processes such as
   preprocessing feature extraction, attack detection and classification
   were performed. Once the malicious event is predicted, it is neglected
   by the cloud user environment. Furthermore, implemented novel DGDBN
   model is tested in the MATLAB programming environment. Finally, the
   performance parameters like accuracy, precision, reconfiguration time,
   Recall, F-measure, and data overhead were measured and compared with
   associated approaches. The novel DGDBN scored the highest accuracy at
   99.6\%, reduced reconfiguration time at 320 ms and optimized data

   We recognized leadership role of Facebook lying in online social media
   industry and network with a social site for may people to connect around
   the world.
   This paper will uses OLS method to estimate effects of Face book good
   management, via both micro and macro factors on net profit. Authors will
   analyze effects of Seven (7) micro and macroeconomic factors such as:
   stock price, net profit, lending rate, inflation, GPD growth, S\&P 500,
   etc. on net profit of an online media company, Facebook in USA during
   2014-2019 and make further analysis.
   Findings show that if inflation, GDP (increasing too much) there is
   significant effect on reducing Facebook net profit wand the next factor

Abstract = {A new generation of mobile touch devices, such as the iPhone, iPad and
   Android devices, are equipped with powerful, modern browsers. However,
   regular websites are not optimized for the specific features and
   constraints of these devices, such as limited screen estate, unreliable
   Internet access, touch-based interaction patterns, and features such as
   GPS. While recent advances in web technology enable web developers to
   build web applications that take advantage of the unique properties of
   mobile devices, developing such applications exposes a number of
   problems, specifically: developers are required to use many loosely
   coupled languages with limited tool support and application code is
   often verbose and imperative. We introduce mobl, a new language designed
   to declaratively construct mobile web applications. Mobl integrates
   languages for user interface design, styling, data modeling, querying
   and application logic into a single, unified language that is flexible,
   expressive, enables early detection of errors, and has good IDE support.},

   Studio.NET being the development environment and Client software is
   programmed in Java with Borland JBuilder 9 being the development tool.
   Findings - Finds that the communication structure following MMS can make
   the multi-robot monitoring and control system have perfect robustness,
   interoperability and reconfigurability. Besides, web services technology
   can conveniently realize MMS services, also can successfully resolve the
   remote multi-robot monitoring and control problem among cross-network,
   cross-platform and heterogeneous systems. Research
   limitations/implications - Provides an easy and low-cost method for
   realizing heterogeneous multi-robot remote driving. The web-based
   distribution of the presented system is critical in enabling
   capabilities such as e-manufacturing, e-diagnostics and e-maintenance.
   Practical implications - The proposed system can be seamlessly
   integrated into other automated manufacturing systems or management
   systems in plug-and-play fashion. The combination of MMS and web
   services is in favor of real manufacturing equipments being embedded in
   the network, so the presented systematic methodology can be a useful
   reference for constructing web-based reconfigurable manufacturing
   systems.
   Originality/value - Provides robot communication model based on MMS and
   web services and presents service-oriented distributed remote multirobot
   monitoring and control software architecture.},

Abstract = {Traditional methods to measure power system harmonics employ the power
   harmonic analyzer or a software package, such as Matlab or others, but
   they do have certain limitations in the graphical programming
   environment, applications for remote monitoring and control performance
   and for multi-point harmonic measurement. In this paper, a PC-based
   virtual instrument (VI) based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to
   implement a remote multipoint power system harmonics analysis and
   monitoring using LabVIEW is proposed. The nearby PC (Server) can collect
   real-time waveform data from different multi-locations and transmit it
   to remote PCs (Clients) for on line harmonic analysis and monitoring via
   the Internet, The history of Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) in the
   waveform signals from remote locations can be also recorded and tracked
   in the data base. The strategies and guidelines are also developed to
   enhance teaching and/or learning the basics of operating Internet-based
   systems. Experimental results have testified its well performance and
   remote web-based capability. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Comput

   Technique: IDS for VCN},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL CRIME AND FORENSICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Abstract = {In this modern era, due to demand for cloud environments in business,
   the size, complexity, and chance of attacks to virtual cloud network
   (VCN) are increased. The protection of VCN is required to maintain the
   faith of the cloud users. Intrusion detection is essential to secure any
   network. The existing approaches that use the conventional neural
   network cannot utilize all information for identifying the intrusions.
   In this paper, the anomaly-based NIDS for VCN is proposed. For feature
   selection, grey wolf optimization (GWO) is hybridized with a bald eagle
   search (BES) algorithm. For classification, a deep learning
   approach-deep sparse auto-encoder (DSAE)-is employed. In this way, this
   paper proposes a NIDS model for VCN named GWO-DES-DSAE. The proposed
   system is simulated in the python programming environment. The proposed
   NIDS model's performance is compared with other recent approaches for
   both binary and multi-class classification on the considered
   datasets-NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS 2017-and found better than other

Abstract = {Objective: The aim of the study is to describe a portable and convenient
   software to facilitate the diagnostics of gestational (GDM) and
   pre-gestational diabetes (PGDM). Materials and methods: An open source
   software, d-GDM, was developed in Java. The integrated development
   environment Android Studio was used as the Android operational
   system.The software for GDM diagnosis uses the criteria endorsed by the
   International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group,
   modified by the World Health Organization. Results: GDM diagnosis
   criteria is not simple to follow, therefore, errors or inconsistencies
   in diagnosis are expected and could delay the appropriate treatment. The
   d-GDM, was developed to assist GDM diagnosis with precision and
   consistency diagnostic reports.The open source software can be
   manipulated conveniently.The operator requires information regarding the
   gestational period and selects the appropriate glycaemic marker options
   from the menu. During operation, pressing the button ``diagnosticar{''}
   on the screen will present the diagnosis and information for the follow
   up. d-GDM is available in Portuguese or English and can be downloaded
   from the Google PlayStore. A responsive web version of d-GDM is also
   available.The usefulness and accuracy of d-GDM was verify by field tests
   involving 22 subjects and 5 mobile phone brands.The approval regards
   user-friendliness and efficiency were 95\% or higher.The GDM diagnosis
   were 100\% correct, in this pilot test. d-GDM is a user-friendly, free
   software for diagnosis that was developed for mobile devices. It has the
   potential to contribute and facilitate the diagnosis of gestational
   diabetes for healthcare professionals.},

Abstract = {Automated test scripts are used with success in many web development
   projects, so as to automatically verify key functionalities of the web
   application under test, reveal possible regressions and run a large
   number of tests in short time. However, the adoption of automated web
   testing brings advantages but also novel problems, among which the test
   code fragility problem. During the evolution of the web application,
   existing test code may easily break and testers have to correct it. In
   the context of automated DOM-based web testing, one of the major costs
   for evolving the test code is the manual effort necessary to repair
   broken web page element locators - lines of source code identifying the
   web elements (e.g. form fields and buttons) to interact with. In this
   work, we present Robula+, a novel algorithm able to generate robust
   XPath-based locators - locators that are likely to work correctly on new
   releases of the web application. We compared Robula+ with several state
   of the practice/art XPath locator generator tools/algorithms. Results
   show that XPath locators produced by Robula+ are by far the most robust.
   Indeed, Robula+ reduces the locators' fragility on average by 90\%
   w.r.t. absolute locators and by 63\% w.r.t. Selenium IDE locators.

Abstract = {The power of Web Service (WS) technology lies in the fact that it
   establishes a common, vendor-neutral platform for integrating
   distributed computing applications, in intranets as well as the Internet
   at large. Semantic Web Services (SWSs) promise to provide solutions to
   the challenges associated with automated discovery, dynamic composition,
   enactment, and other tasks associated with managing and using
   service-based systems. One of the barriers to a wider adoption of SWS
   technology is the lack of tools for creating SWS specifications. OWL-S
   is one of the major SWS description languages. This paper presents an
   OWL-S Editor, whose objective is to allow easy, intuitive OWL-S service
   development and to provide a variety of special-purpose capabilities to
   facilitate SWS design. The editor is implemented as a plugin to the
   Protege OWL ontology editor, and is being developed as open-source
   software.},

Abstract = {This paper covers recent computer system upgrades made to the DIII-D
   tokamak control and neutral beam computer systems. The systems
   responsible for monitoring and controlling the DIII-D tokamak and
   injecting neutral beam power have recently come online with new
   computing hardware and software. The new hardware and software have
   provided a number of significant improvements over the previous Modcomp
   AEG VME and accessware based systems. These improvements include the
   incorporation of faster, less expensive, and more readily available
   computing hardware which have provided performance increases of up to a
   factor 20 over the prior systems. A more modern graphical user interface
   with advanced plotting capabilities has improved feedback to users on
   the operating status of the tokamak and neutral beam systems. The
   elimination of aging and non supportable hardware and software has
   increased overall maintainability. The distinguishing characteristics of
   the new system include: (1) a PC based computer platform running the
   Redhat version of the Linux operating system; (2) a custom PCI CAMAC
   software driver developed by general atomics for the kinetic systems
   2115 serial highway card; and (3) a custom developed supervisory control
   and data acquisition (SCADA) software package based on Kylix, an
   inexpensive interactive development environment (IDE) tool from borland
   corporation. This paper provides specific details of the upgraded
   computer systems. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Nucleos(t)ide analogues causes HBV S gene mutations and carcinogenesis},
Journal = {HEPATOBILIARY \& PANCREATIC DISEASES INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6},
Pages = {579-586},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The long-term use of nucleos(t)ide analogues causes drug
   resistance and mutations in the HBV reverse transcriptase (RT) region of
   the polymerase gene. The RT region overlaps the HBV surface gene (S
   gene) and therefore, the mutations in the RT region simultaneously
   modify S gene sequence. Certain mutations in the RT region bring about
   truncated S proteins because the corresponding changed S gene encodes a
   stop codon which results in the loss of a large portion of the
   C-terminal hydrophobic region of HBV surface protein. The
   rtA181T/sW172{*}, rtM204I/sW196{*} and rtV191I/sW182{*} are the most
   frequently reported drug-resistant mutations with C-terminal truncation,
   these mutations have oncogenic potential.
   DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Web of Science were searched using terms:
   ``hepatitis B virus{''}, ``HBV drug resistance mutation'; ``HBV surface
   protein'; ``HBV truncation; ``hepatocellular carcinoma';
   ``rtA181T/sW172{*}'; ``rtM204IfsW196{*}'; ``rtV191I/sW182{*}'; and
   relevant articles published in English in the past decades were
   reviewed.
   RESULTS: The rtA181T/sW172{*} and rtV191I/sW182{*} mutants occurred more
   frequently than the rtM204I/sW196{*} mutant both in chronic hepatitis B
   patients and the HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. Although
   these mutations occur naturally, nucleos(t)ide analogues therapy is the
   main driving force. These mutations may exist alone or coexist with
   other HBV mutations. All these three mutants impair the virion secretion
   and result in HBV surface protein retention and serum HBV DNA level
   reduction. These mutations possess potential carcinogenic properties.
   The three mutations are resistant to more than one nucleos(t)ide
   analogue and therefore, it is difficult to treat the patients with the
   truncated mutations.
   CONCLUSIONS: Nucleos(t)ide analogues induce drug resistance and HBV S
   gene truncated mutations. These mutations have potential carcinogenesis.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the Cloud environment has played a major role in
   running High-Performance Computing (HPC) applications, which are
   computationally intensive and data intensive in nature. The
   High-Performance Computing Cloud (HPCC) or Science Cloud (SC) provides
   the resources to these types of applications in an on demand and
   scalable manner. Scheduling of jobs or applications in a Cloud
   environment is NP-Complete and complex in nature due to the dynamicity
   of resources and on demand user application requirements. The main
   motivation behind this research study is to design and develop a CLOUD
   Resource Broker (CLOUDRB) for efficiently managing cloud resources and
   completing jobs for scientific applications within a user-specified
   deadline. It is implemented and integrated with a Deadline-based Job
   Scheduling and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based Resource
   Allocation mechanism. Our proposed approach intends to achieve the
   objectives of minimizing both execution time and cost based on the
   defined fitness function. It is simulated by modeling the HPC jobs and
   Cloud resources using the Matlab programming environment. The simulation
   results prove the effectiveness of the proposed research work by
   minimizing the completion time, cost and job rejection ratio and
   maximizing the number of jobs completing their applications within a
   deadline and meeting the user's satisfaction. The proposed work has been
   tested in our Eucalyptus-based cloud environments by submitting
   real-world HPC applications and observed the improvements in
   performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {MEDICINE},

Month = {MAR 24},
Abstract = {Background: There is controversy over the drainage threshold for removal
   of chest tubes in the absence of significant air leakage after selective
   pulmonary resection.Methods: A comprehensive search of online databases
   (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Ovid,
   Elsevier, Ebsco, and Wiley) and clinical trial registries (WHO-ICTRP and
   ClinicalTrials.gov) was performed to investigate the efficacy and safety
   of early chest tube removal with high-output drainage. Primary outcome
   (postoperative hospital day) and secondary outcomes (30-day
   complications, rate of thoracentesis, and chest tube placement) were
   extracted and synthesized. Subgroup analysis, meta-regression, and
   sensitivity analysis were used to explore the potential heterogeneity.
   Study quality was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and evidence
   was graded using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development
   and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment by the online GRADEpro Guideline
   Development Tool.Results: Six cohort studies with a total of 1262
   patients were included in the final analysis. The postoperative hospital
   stay in the high-output group was significantly shorter than in the
   conventional treatment group (weighted mean difference: -1.34 {[}-2.34
   to -0.34] day, P = .009). While there was no significant difference
   between 2 groups in 30-day complications (relative ratio {[}RR]: 0.92
   {[}0.77-1.11], P = .38), the rate of thoracentesis (RR: 1.93
   {[}0.63-5.88], P = .25) and the rate of chest tube placement (RR: 1.00
   {[}0.37-2.70], P = .99). According to the sensitivity analysis, the
   relative impacts of the 2 groups had already stabilized. Subgroup
   analysis revealed that postoperative hospital stay was modified by
   Newcastle-Ottawa Scale score. The online GRADEpro Guideline Development
   Tool presented very low quality of evidence for the available
   data.Conclusions: This meta-analysis revealed that it is feasible and
   safe to remove a chest tube with high-output drainage after pulmonary
   resection for selected patients.},

Abstract = {Background: The seroclearance of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in
   patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is considered to be associated
   with favourable clinical outcomes.
   Aims: This meta-analysis was performed to establish the proportion of
   HBsAg loss rates among CHB patients who received combination treatment
   based on pegylated interferon (PegIFN). Four combination strategies have
   been studied with the aim of improving HBsAg loss: ``de novo,{''}
   ``NA-experienced,{''} ``switch-to{''} and ``add-on.{''} This
   meta-analysis was performed to determine which, if any, of these
   combination strategies was more effective.
   Methods: Medline, Web of Science and Embase databases were searched from
   inception to December 2017. The proportion of patients who achieved
   HBsAg loss after combination therapy was pooled using a random-effects
   model.
   Results: Twenty-four studies fulfilled the meta-analysis criteria. The
   overall pooled proportion suggested that the rate of HBsAg loss could be
   increased to 9\% (95\% CI: 7\%-12\%) based on the combination treatment
   in CHB patients. Compared with ``de novo{''} strategy (8\%, 95\% CI:
   6\%-10\%), the ``nucleos(t)ide analogues-experienced{''} (11\%, 95\% CI:
   8\%-15\%) was found to be more likely (P=0.036) to achieve a response.
   Compared with the ``add-on{''} strategy (8\%, 95\% CI: 5\%-13\%), the
   ``switch-to{''} (14\%, 95\% CI: 9\%-20\%) was found to be more likely
   (P=0.012) to achieve HBsAg loss.
   Conclusion: The ``nucleos(t)ide analogues-experienced{''} strategy was
   more effective than the ``De novo{''} strategy in achieving HBsAg loss
   for CHB patients. Combination treatment using regimens based on Peg-IFN
   may be useful to help nucleos(t)ide analogues-treated patients, who have
   experienced at least 48 weeks of nucleot(s)ide analogue, achieve HBsAg
   seroclearance.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL},

Abstract = {The significant development of the Internet has posed some new
   challenges and many new programming tools have been developed to address
   such challenges. Today, semantic web is a modern paradigm for
   representing and accessing knowledge data on the Internet. This paper
   tries to use the semantic tools such as resource definition framework
   (RDF) and RDF query language (SPARQL) for the optimization purpose.
   These tools are combined with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the
   selection of the best solutions depends on its fitness. Instead of the
   local best solution, a neighborhood of solutions for each particle can
   be defined and used for the calculation of the new position, based on
   the key ideas from semantic web domain. The preliminary results by
   optimizing ten benchmark functions showed the promising results and thus
   this method should be investigated further.},

   automating entire experiments a reality. Automation offers the benefit
   of high-throughput experimentation, rapid prototyping, and improved

   experiments is a difficult task as it requires programming expertise.
   Here, we present a web-based visual development environment called
   BioBlocks for describing experimental protocols in biology. It is based
   on Google's Blockly and Scratch, and requires little or no experience in
   computer programming to automate the execution of experiments. The
   experiments can be specified, saved, modified, and shared between
   multiple users in an easy manner. BioBlocks is open-source and can be
   customized to execute protocols on local robotic platforms or remotely,
   that is, in the cloud. It aims to serve as a de facto open standard for
   programming protocols in Biology.},

Abstract = {The paper introduces a visual programming language and corresponding web
   and cloud-based development environment called NetsBlox. NetsBlox is an
   extension of Snap! and builds upon its visual formalism as well as its
   open source code base. NetsBlox adds distributed programming
   capabilities by introducing two well-known abstractions to block-based
   programming: message passing and Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). Messages
   containing data can be exchanged by two or more NetsBlox programs
   running on different computers connected to the Internet. RPCs are
   called on a client program and are executed on the NetsBlox server.
   These two abstractions make it possible to create distributed programs
   such as multi-player games or client-server applications. We believe
   that NetsBlox not only teaches basic distributed programming concepts
   but also provides increased motivation for high-school students to
   become creators and not just consumers of technology. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Abstract = {Formally verifying a program requires significant skill not only because
   of complex interactions between program sub-components, but also because
   of deficiencies in current verification interfaces. These skill barriers
   make verification economically unattractive by preventing the use of
   less-skilled (less-expensive) workers and distributed workflows (i.e.,
   crowdsourcing).
   This paper presents VeriWeb, a web-based IDE for verification that
   decomposes the task of writing verifiable specifications into manageable
   subproblems. To overcome the information loss caused by task
   decomposition, and to reduce the skill required to verify a program,
   VeriWeb incorporates several innovative user interface features: drag
   and drop condition construction, concrete counterexamples, and
   specification inlining.
   To evaluate VeriWeb, we performed three experiments. First, we show that
   VeriWeb lowers the time and monetary cost of verification by performing
   a comparative study of VeriWeb and a traditional tool using 14 paid
   subjects contracted hourly from Exhedra Solution's vWorker online
   marketplace. Second, we demonstrate the dearth and insufficiency of
   current ad-hoc labor marketplaces for verification by recruiting workers
   from Amazon's Mechanical Turk to perform verification with VeriWeb.
   Finally, we characterize the minimal communication overhead incurred
   when VeriWeb is used collaboratively by observing two pairs of
   developers each use the tool simultaneously to verify a single program.},

Abstract = {Macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (MIP-1), MIP-1 alpha (CCL3) and MIP-1
   beta (CCL4) are chemokines crucial for immune responses towards
   infection and inflammation. Both MIP-1 alpha and MIP-1 beta form
   high-molecular-weight aggregates. Our crystal structures reveal that
   MIP-1 aggregation is a polymerization process and human MIP-1 alpha and
   MIP-1 beta form rod-shaped, double-helical polymers. Biophysical
   analyses and mathematical modelling show that MIP-1 reversibly forms a
   polydisperse distribution of rod-shaped polymers in solution.
   Polymerization buries receptor-binding sites of MIP-1 alpha, thus
   depolymerization mutations enhance MIP-1 alpha to arrest monocytes onto
   activated human endothelium. However, same depolymerization mutations
   render MIP-1 alpha ineffective in mouse peritoneal cell recruitment.
   Mathematical modelling reveals that, for a long-range chemotaxis of
   MIP-1, polymerization could protect MIP-1 from proteases that
   selectively degrade monomeric MIP-1. Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is
   identified as such a protease and decreased expression of IDE leads to
   elevated MIP-1 levels in microglial cells. Our structural and proteomic
   studies offer a molecular basis for selective degradation of MIP-1. The
   regulated MIP-1 polymerization and selective inactivation of MIP-1
   monomers by IDE could aid in controlling the MIP-1 chemotactic gradient
   for immune surveillance. The EMBO Journal (2010) 29, 3952-3966.

   PhoneIoT also allows building a Graphical User Interface (GUI) remotely
   from NetsBlox, which can be set to trigger custom code written by the
   student via NetsBlox's message system. This approach enables students to

Abstract = {A Resource Space Grid is a virtual Grid that aims at effectively
   sharing, using and managing versatile resources across the Internet. The
   kernel of the Resource Space Grid includes a Resource Space Model (RSM)
   and a uniform Resource Using Mechanism (RUM). This paper presents the
   Resource Space Grid's core scientific issues and methodology,
   architecture, model and theory, design criteria and method, and
   practice. A normal form theory is proposed to normalize the resource
   space-a coordinate system for uniformly specifying and organizing
   resources. The RUM provides not only the end-users with an operable
   resource browser to operate resources using the built-in Resource
   Operation Language (ROL), but also the application developers with the
   ROL-based programming environment. The prototype platform based on the
   proposed model and method has been implemented and used for sharing and
   managing resources in distributed research teams. Operations on Resource
   Spaces can constitute the virtual communities of Resource Space Grids-a
   platform independent resource sharing environment. Copyright (C) 2004

Title = {Developing the TriLab, a Triple Access Mode (Hands-On, Virtual, Remote)
   Laboratory, of a Process Control Rig Using LabVIEW and Joomla},
Journal = {COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {21},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Laboratory education is a core part of engineering curricula;
   engineering students generally prefer to work on something real. The
   classical mode and the oldest form of laboratory education is the
   hands-on mode. Advances in information and communication technologies
   have contributed to the laboratory education by creating two new modes,
   the simulated (virtual) mode and the online controlled mode (remote).
   Recently, developments or utilizations of hybrid structures of two types
   (e.g., virtual and hands-on, or remote and hands-on) have been reported
   in the literature; however, until now there are no reports of hybrid
   structures of the three types together. This paper describes the
   technical development of a novel laboratory model that combines the
   three modes in one unifying software package, namely the TriLab, by
   using Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW). It
   is shown that LabVIEW provides a single programming environment for
   developing all components of the TriLab. Furthermore, it is shown that
   the Joomla web content management system can be used as a solution for
   efficient deployment of a remote lab online portal on the top of the
   LabVIEW core software. The development of the TriLab using LabVIEW and
   Joomla for an Instrumentation and Control Engineering Laboratory rig is
   shown. The analysis of student survey is presented which has shown
   positive impact of the pedagogical utilization of the TriLab. This is
   the first paper which aims to provide engineering academics a generic
   architecture and software solutions to rapidly develop their own TriLab.

Journal = {LIBRARY HI TECH},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {440-453},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to report the result of follow-up research oil
   end-users conceptions of information visibility oil the web and their
   conceptualizations of success and failure in web searching.
   Design/methodology/approach - The data were collected by a questionnaire
   followed by a brief interview with the participants. The questionnaire
   was developed based oil the information visibility model suggested by
   the author in the original study. Fifty-two library and information
   sciences, students from Tarbiat Mollem University (TMU) and Iran
   University of Medical Sciences (IUMS) in Tehran took part in the study.
   Findings - The model of information visibility can enable web users to
   gain a better understanding of their information seeking (IS) outcomes,
   and it can assist them to improve their information literacy skills. The
   model can provide a theoretical framework to investigate web users IS
   behavior and can be used as a diagnostic tool to explore the contextual
   mid conceptual elements affecting the visibility of information for
   end-users.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper suggests a visibility
   learning diary (VLD), which might be useful to measure the efficiency of
   information literacy training Courses.
   Originality/value - The contextual and conceptual approach of the paper
   provides ides a deeper insight into the issue of information visibility,
   which has received little attention by IS and information retrieval
   researchers until now.},

   A principled approach to configuration was adopted from the outset with
   special attention given to ongoing product enhancement. Computer Parts
   and Engineering Constraints are separated in this unique configuration
   engine allowing each to be updated independently; typically by different
   people. The complex modelling essential in capturing multi-way
   relationships is dealt with by coding configuration information using a
   tool boasting a patented pattern-matching algorithm. This highly
   versatile rules-based, object-orientated development tool encouraged the
   simplification of a potentially difficult and complex problem into a
   relatively straightforward and extensible system.
   This online configuration system goes live on the Digital customer Web
   pages early next year. Future enhancements to PCONFIG includes a parts
   editor, a constraints editor and ordering methods allowing users to
   place orders not only by part numbers, but also system functions and

   Spatial Modeling Language. The novel module of software tools can
   convert raster data to brightness temperature and includes a special set
   time function, cloud top height, and cloud cover area. This study
   demonstrates successful cloud detection and classification from the
   Multi-functional Transport Satellite-2, which will be useful in

Abstract = {In this paper, we present briefly the implementation of a Java interface
   for WMPI, a Windows-based implementation of MPI, Then, we describe a
   system that is oriented for Web-based computing and present a solution
   to integrate WMPI with this tool by making use of a Java bridge
   component and the Java bindings for WMPI, This solution allows the
   execution of meta-applications over a mixed configuration of platforms,
   execution models and programming languages. The resulting system
   provides a way to solve the problem of heterogeneity and to unleash the
   potential of diverse computational resources and programming tools.

Title = {Effects of intradialytic exercise on health-related quality of life in
   patients undergoing maintenance haemodialysis: a systematic review and
   meta-analysis},
Journal = {QUALITY OF LIFE RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Purpose To summarize the current evidence regarding the effectiveness of
   intradialytic exercise (IDE) on the health-related quality of life
   (HRQOL) of patients undergoing maintenance haemodialysis. Methods Five
   English databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and
   ScienceDirect) and four Chinese databases (VIP, WAN FANG, CNKI, CBM)
   were comprehensively searched from their inception to 18 March 2021.
   This study was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for
   Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Two independent
   reviewers selected the papers and extracted the details of each study
   therein. Only randomized controlled trials were included. The risk of
   bias tool version 2.0 was used to evaluate the risk of bias of the
   included studies. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to pool
   the effect size. Results Thirty-three eligible studies with 1481
   participants were included. For the generic HRQOL, assessed by the
   Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form survey, IDE significantly improved
   most domains and the physical component summary compared with the
   control group. Furthermore, aerobic exercise alone significantly
   improved more domains compared to resistance exercise, combined aerobic
   and resistance exercise, and other types of exercise. Regarding the
   kidney-specific HRQOL, IDE improved three of eleven domains, including
   the symptom/problem list, the effect of kidney disease, and the quality
   of social interaction. No significant effect was found on other domains
   of kidney-specific HRQOL. Conclusion Intradialytic exercise could
   benefit patients undergoing haemodialysis in improving most domains of
   generic HRQOL, but the effect on most domains of kidney-specific HRQOL
   is insufficient.},

Abstract = {The science and engineering disciplines rely heavily on computer
   simulation as a tool for solving large, complex mathematical problems.
   The difficulty of creating scientific simulation code presents the need
   for a programming environment that is able to assist the programmer in
   the code development process. This paper describes a development
   methodology and a prototype implementation of a system that provides
   such assistance. Refiner, a programming environment for creating
   scientific simulators, provides expert users with online support for the
   entire development process, from mathematical modeling to low-level
   implementation details. Refiner is based on Posit, a high-level
   object-oriented modeling and programming language. Mathematical models
   are specified, and executable programs are then developed through the
   successive application of semantics-preserving program transformations.
   Code development is recorded in the form of a refinement tree structure
   where each path from root to leaf encodes a series of program
   transformations representing a single-solution strategy.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   To evaluate pediatric educators' use of and satisfaction with the
   Academic Pediatric Association's Educational Guidelines for Pediatric
   Residency.
   Method
   The authors used customized programming to document all registered users
   and downloaded files from the Guidelines Web site for a 30-month period
   after site completion. An online survey of volunteer users was
   conducted.
   Results
   Between July 2005 and December 2007, 1,747 individuals registered on the
   Web site, and 8,754 files were downloaded. Registrants who downloaded
   files (n = 1,239) represented 97\% of the pediatric residency programs
   in 2008 that were approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate
   Medical Education. During 30 months, the frequency of downloads remained
   robust, peaking each spring. Curriculum-building tools were downloaded
   by 97\% of programs using the site; the majority chose predesigned
   formats rather than self-selected lists of goals and objectives.
   Resident evaluation forms and tutorials were downloaded less frequently.
   A survey was completed by 111 site users, who indicated that the
   Guidelines tools were useful for Residency Review Committee site visit
   preparation. Most respondents said that the curriculum-building tools
   were easy to use, adaptable, and helpful in integration of competencies
   into residency programs. Respondents rated tutorials highly for
   educational content and clarity.
   Conclusions
   The data collection methods offer a practical strategy for evaluating
   access to online curriculum development tools. The majority of U.S.
   pediatric residency programs have accessed Guidelines' resources for
   curriculum development; patterns of use have been sustained over time.
   Most users preferred the predesigned versions of the materials. Users
   surveyed found the tools useful for planning rotations and integrating
   competencies into their programs and reported high satisfaction with the
   Guidelines.},

Title = {What happened to my application? Helping end users comprehend evolution
   through variation management},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {55-74},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Context: Millions of end users are creating software applications. These
   end users typically do not have clear requirements in mind; instead,
   they debug their programs into existence and reuse their own or other
   persons' code. These behaviors often result in the creation of numerous
   variants of programs. Current end-user programming environments do not
   provide support for managing such variants.
   Objective: We wish to understand the variant creation behavior of end
   user programmers. Based on this understanding we wish to develop an
   automated system to help end user programmers efficiently manage
   variants.
   Method: We conducted an on-line survey to understand when and how
   end-user programmers create program variants and how they manage them.
   Our 124 survey respondents were recruited via email from among non
   computer science majors who had taken at least one course in the
   computer science department at our university; the respondents were
   involved in the Engineering, Sciences, Arts, and Management fields.
   Based on the results of this survey we identified a set of design
   requirements for providing variation management support for end users.
   We implemented variation management support in App Inventor - a drag and
   drop programming environment for creating mobile applications. Our
   support, AppinventorHelper, is meant to help end-user programmers
   visualize the provenance of and relationships among variants. We
   conducted a think-aloud study with 10 participants to evaluate the
   usability of AppinventorHelper. The participants were selected on a
   first come, first-served basis from those who responded to our
   recruitment email sent to list-servers. They were all end users majoring
   in electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, or physics. None had
   formal training in software engineering methods, but all had some
   experience with visual programming languages.
   Results: Our (user study) results indicate that AppinventorHelper can
   help end users navigate through variants and find variants that could be
   utilized cost-effectively as examples or actual code upon which to build
   new applications. For example, in one of our empirical studies end users
   explored variants of a paint application in order to find a variant that
   could easily be extended to incorporate a new feature.
   Conclusions: Our survey results show that end users do indeed reuse
   program variants and suggest that understanding the differences between
   variants is important. Further, end users prefer running code and
   looking at outputs, accessing source code and meta information such as
   filenames, referring to the creation and update dates of programs, and
   having information on the authors of code. When selecting variants users
   prefer to look at their major features such as correctness, similarity
   and authorship information. End users rely primarily on memory to track
   changes. They seldom make use of online or configuration management
   tools. Hence, integrated domain-specific variation management tools like
   AppInventorHelper can significantly help improve users' interactions
   with the system. A key contribution of our work is a set of design
   requirements for end-user programming environments that facilitate the
   management and understanding of the provenance of program variants.},

Abstract = {The service-oriented computing (SOC) paradigm has recently gained a lot
   of attention in the software industry because SOC represents a novel and
   a fresh way of architecting distributed applications. SOC is usually
   materialized via web services, which allows developers to structure
   applications exposing a clear, public interface to their capabilities.
   Although conceptually and technologically mature, SOC still lacks
   adequate development support from a methodological point of view. In
   this paper, we present the EasySOC project, a set of guidelines to
   simplify the development of service-oriented applications and services.
   EasySOC is a synthesized catalog of best SOC development practices that
   arise as a result of several years of research in fundamental Services
   Computing topics, that is, Web Service Description Language-based
   technical specification, Web Service discovery, and Web Service
   outsourcing. In addition, we describe a materialization of the
   guidelines for the Java language, which has been implemented as a
   plug-in for the Eclipse IDE. We believe that both the practical nature
   of the guidelines and the availability of this software that enforces
   them may help software practitioners to rapidly exploit our ideas for
   building real SOC applications. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons,

   state-of-the-art bioinformatic tools, making these available as an
   integrated package through the novel use of web-based programmability
   and an integrated Wiki-based community code and data store. The pilot
   instantiation of BioLingua, which has been developed in collaboration
   with several cyanobacteriologists, integrates knowledge about a subset
   of cyanobacteria with the Gene Ontology, KEGG and BioCyc knowledge
   bases. We introduce the BioLingua concept, architecture and language,

Title = {BacAv, a new free online platform for clinical back-averaging},
Journal = {CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY PRACTICE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {5},
Pages = {38-42},
Abstract = {Objective: The back-average technique is very useful to study the
   relation between the activity in the cortex and the muscles. It has two
   main clinical applications, Bereitschaftspotential (BP) recording and
   myoclonus studies. The BP is a slow wave negativity originating in the
   supplementary motor cortex and premotor cortex that precedes voluntary
   movements. This wave also precedes involuntary movements in functional
   movement disorders (FMD), and it can be used as a helpful diagnostic
   tool. For the myoclonus studies, the back-average technique is very
   important to help localizing the source of the myoclonus. The hardware
   needed to do BP or myoclonus studies is standard and available in any
   electrophysiology lab, but there are not many software solutions to do
   the analysis. In this article together with describing the methodology
   that we use for recording clinical BPs and myoclonus, we present BacAv,
   an online free application that we developed for the purpose of doing
   back-average analysis.
   Methods: BacAv was developed in ``R{''} language using Rstudio, a free
   integrated development environment. The recommended parameters for the
   data acquisition for BP recording and myoclonus studies are given in
   this section.
   Results: The platform was successfully developed, is able to read txt
   files, look for muscle bursts, segment the data, and plot the average.
   The parameters of the algorithm that look for the muscle bursts can be
   adapted according to the characteristics of the dataset.
   Conclusion: We have developed software for clinicians who do not have
   sophisticated equipment to do back-averaging.
   Significance: This tool will make this useful analysis method more
   available in a clinical environment. Published by Elsevier B.V. on

   The configuration file is covering all the variations, with

   (3) personalizing the web application look and feel by simply selecting
   a design template. To achieve this, an ontology-based strategy is
   introduced to support end-users throughout the web application

Abstract = {An important issue arising from Web Service applications is how to
   conveniently, accurately and efficiently retrieve services from
   large-scale and expanding service repositories. This paper proposes a
   flexible Web Service retrieval approach, which solves this issue by
   means of an orthogonal service space and establishing the multi-valued
   specialization relationships between services. The similarity degree
   between services is measured based on the specialization relationship
   between operations defined in services. An SQL-like flexible query
   language is used to support the flexible retrieval of services. The
   related programming environment and graphical user operation interface
   of the language have been implemented in the Service Grid environment.
   Compared with the current UDDI-based service retrieval approach, the
   proposed approach has the advantages of convenience, accuracy and

Title = {Large-Scale, Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing of Palaeo-River Networks: A
   Case Study from Northwest India and its Implications for the Indus
   Civilisation},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Remote sensing has considerable potential to contribute to the
   identification and reconstruction of lost hydrological systems and
   networks. Remote sensing-based reconstructions of palaeo-river networks
   have commonly employed single or limited time-span imagery, which limits
   their capacity to identify features in complex and varied landscape
   contexts. This paper presents a seasonal multi-temporal approach to the
   detection of palaeo-rivers over large areas based on long-term
   vegetation dynamics and spectral decomposition techniques. Twenty-eight
   years of Landsat 5 data, a total of 1711 multi-spectral images, have
   been bulk processed using Google Earth Engine((C)) Code Editor and cloud
   computing infrastructure. The use of multi-temporal data has allowed us
   to overcome seasonal cultivation patterns and long-term visibility
   issues related to recent crop selection, extensive irrigation and
   land-use patterns. The application of this approach on the Sutlej-Yamuna
   interfluve (northwest India), a core area for the Bronze Age Indus
   Civilisation, has enabled the reconstruction of an unsuspectedly complex
   palaeo-river network comprising more than 8000 km of palaeo-channels. It
   has also enabled the definition of the morphology of these relict
   courses, which provides insights into the environmental conditions in
   which they operated. These new data will contribute to a better
   understanding of the settlement distribution and environmental settings
   in which this, often considered riverine, civilisation operated.},

   information. The authors are now using the Web, coupled with their own
   local clinical data server and vocabulary server, to carry out rapid
   prototype development of clinical information systems. They have
   developed one such prototype system that can be run on most popular
   computing platforms from anywhere on the Internet. The Web paradigm
   allows easy integration of clinical information with other local and
   Internet-based information sources. The Web also simplifies many aspects
   of application design; for example, it includes facilities for the use
   of encryption to meet the authors' security and confidentiality
   requirements. The prototype currently runs on only the Web server in the
   Department of Medical Informatics at Columbia University, but it could
   be run on other Web servers that access the authors' clinical data and
   vocabulary servers. It could also be adapted to access clinical
   information from other systems with similar server capabilities. This

Abstract = {Several studies have explored the factors that influence self-efficacy
   as well as its contribution to academic development in online learning
   environments in recent years. However, little research has investigated
   the effect of a web-based learning environment on enhancing students'
   beliefs about self-efficacy for learning. This is especially noticeable
   in the field of online distributed programming. We need to design online
   learning environments for programming education that foster both
   students' self-efficacy for programming learning and the added value
   that students perceive of the tool as a successful learning environment.
   To that end, we conducted a quantitative analysis to collect and analyze
   data of students using an online Distributed Systems Laboratory (DSLab)
   in an authentic, long-term online educational experience. The results
   indicate that (1) our distributed programming learning tool provides an
   environment that increases students' belief of programming
   self-efficacy; (2) the students' experience with the tool strengthens
   their belief in the intrinsic value of the tool; however (3) the
   relationship between students' belief in the tool intrinsic value and
   their self-efficacy is inconclusive. This study provides relevant
   implications for online distributed (or general) programming course
   teachers who seek to increase students' engagement, learning and
   performance in this field.},

Journal = {ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY},

Month = {2023 JAN 19},
Abstract = {Microdroplet reactions have aroused much interest due to significant
   reaction acceleration (e.g., ultrafast protein digestion in
   microdroplets could occur in less than 1 ms). This study integrated a

   and an enzyme (IdeS or IgdE) enabled rapid analysis with high
   reproducibility (total analysis time: 2 min per sample; reproducibility:
   similar to 2\% coefficient of variation). Spraying the sample in
   ammonium acetate buffer (pH 7) using a jet stream source allowed
   efficient digestion of antibodies and efficient ionization of resulting
   antibody subunits under native-pH conditions. Importantly, it also
   provided a platform to directly study specific binding of an antibody
   and an antigen (e.g., detecting the complexes mAb/RSFV antigen and F(ab
   `)2/RSVF in this study). Furthermore, subsequent tandem MS analysis of a
   resulting subunit from microdroplet digestion enabled localizing
   post-translational modifications on particular domains of a mAb in a
   rapid fashion. In combination with IdeS digestion of an antibody,
   additional tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) reduction and
   N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) deglycosylation reactions that facilitate
   antibody analysis could be realized in ``one-pot{''} spraying.
   Interestingly, increased deglycosylation yield in microdroplets was
   found, simply by raising the sample temperature. We expect that our
   method would have a high impact for rapid characterization of monoclonal
   antibodies.},

Abstract = {Cloud computing (CC) is an emerging field in the IT sector due to its
   prospective, progress and incredible impact on the development of that
   sector. CC is a centralized and distributed network comprised of
   interrelated and interconnected systems, and the whole universe uses the
   cloud for the ultimate portion of data transmission. However, the cloud
   cannot provide security assurance, which is one of the main drawbacks of
   the cloud. Blockchain is the fascinating massive attention in the cloud
   field because of its security features. It consists of a chain of
   several blocks composed of multiple transactions. These data available
   in blocks are encrypted and cannot be altered by any in the world.
   Several emerging applications are affected by insurance companies,
   anomalies, thieves, and intruders fetching individual data and
   disturbing the user's routine. This paper develops a blockchain-based
   modified infinite chaotic elliptic cryptography (MICEC) to improve and
   tighten the security in the cloud. It contains three stages: protection
   of authentication, ownership protection, and identity mapping
   validation. At first, MICEC is employed for an authentication process
   that combines the infinite elliptic curve cryptography and modified
   chaotic neural network for pair of key generation and data encryption.
   In addition, the hash function is generated with the aid of the improved
   message digest 5 algorithm. Second, the improved Message Content
   Recommendation Algorithm with Latent Dirichlet Allocation is used to
   compute the score values. At last, cosine similarity matching criteria
   is computed in the validation based on the digests. The proposed work is
   simulated using the JAVA programming language with NetBeans IDE. The
   performance is evaluated and compared to other methods.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Context: From the past few years, Application Programming Interface
   (API) is widely used for mobile- and web-based application developments.
   Software developers can integrate third-party services into their
   projects to achieve their development goals efficiently using APIs;
   however, with the rapid increase in the number of APIs, the manual
   selection of Mashup-oriented API is becoming more difficult for the
   developer. Objective: In the COVID-19 pandemic, everyone wants an update
   about the latest Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and the latest
   information on COVID-19. Additionally, a software developer wants to
   develop an application that provides the SOPs and latest information of
   COVID-19; a developer can add these functionalities into an application
   using COVID-19-based APIs. Moreover, the current work aims at proposing
   a COVID-19-based API recommendation system for the developers. Method:
   In this study, we propose a COVID-19-based API recommendation system for
   developers. The recommendation system takes a developer query as input
   and recommends top-3 APIs and supported features, which help the
   developer during software development. Furthermore, the proposed
   COVID-19-based API recommendation system ensures the maximum
   participation of the developers by validating the recommended APIs and
   recommendation system from the expert developers using research
   questionnaires. Results: Additionally, the proposed COVID-19-based API
   recommendation system's output is validated by expert developers and
   evaluated on 120 expert developers' queries. In addition, experiment
   results show that single value decomposition achieves better prediction.
   Conclusion: We conclude that it is significantly important to recommend
   APIs along with supported features to the developer for project
   development, and future work is needed to take more developer's queries
   also to build Integrated Development Environment for the developers.},

   Meta-Analysis},
Journal = {DISEASE MARKERS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {2017},
Abstract = {Aim. To determine whether nucleot(s) ide analogs therapy has survival
   benefit for patients with HBV-related HCC after unresectable treatment.
   Method. A systematic search was conducted through seven electronic
   databases including PubMed, OVID, EMBASE, Cochrane Databases, Elsevier,
   Wiley Online Library, and BMJ Best Practice. All studies comparing NA
   combined with unresectable treatment versus unresectable treatment alone
   were considered for inclusion. The primary outcome was the overall
   survival (OS) after unresectable treatment for patients with HBV-related
   HCC. The secondary outcome was the progression-free survival (PFS).
   Results were expressed as hazard ratio (HR) for survival with 95\%
   confidence intervals. Results. We included six studies with 994
   patients: 409 patients in nucleot(s) ide analogs therapy group and 585
   patients without antiviral therapy in control group. There were
   significant improvements for the overall survival (HR = 0.57; 95\% CI =
   0.47-0.70; p < 0.001) and progression-free survival (HR = 0.84; 95\% CI
   = 0.71-0.99; p = 0.034) in the NA-treated group compared with the
   control group. Funnel plot showed that there was no significant
   publication bias in these studies. When it comes to antiviral drugs and
   operation method, it also showed benefit in NA-treated group. At the
   same time, overall mortality as well as mortality secondary to liver
   failure in NA-treated group was obviously lesser. Sensitivity analyses
   confirmed the robustness of the results. Conclusions. Nucleot(s) ide
   analogs therapy after unresectable treatment has potential beneficial
   effects in terms of overall survival and progression- free survival. NA
   therapy should be considered in clinical practice.},

Year = {2004},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {63-77},
Month = {APR-JUL},
Abstract = {The increasing complexity of software development spawns lots of
   specialised tools to edit code, employ UML schemes, integrate
   documentation, and so on. The problem is that the tool builders
   themselves are responsible for making their tools interoperable with
   other tools or development environments. Because they cannot anticipate
   all other tools they can integrate with, a lot of tools cannot
   co-operate. This paper introduces the classification model, a
   lightweight integration medium that enables unrelated tools that were
   not meant to be integrated to cooperate easily. Moreover, the tool
   integration is done by a tool integrator, and not by the tool builder.
   To validate this claim, we show how to integrate several third-party
   tools using the classification model, and how it forms the foundation
   for the StarBrowser, a Smalltalk browser integrating different tools.

   Optimization (EMFO) Algorithm},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A new generation of computing resources is available to customers via
   IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS administrations, making cloud computing the most
   significant innovation in recent history for the general public. A
   virtual machine (VM) is configured, started, and maintained across
   numerous physical hosts using IaaS. In many cases, cloud providers (CPs)
   charge utility customers who have registered their premises with the
   utility registration authorities. Given the opposing aims of increasing
   customer demand fulfillment while decreasing costs and optimizing asset
   efficiency, efficient VM allocation is generally considered as one of
   the most difficult tasks for CPs to overcome. This paper proposes the
   Enhanced Moth Flame Optimization (EMFO) algorithm to provide a unique
   strategy for assigning virtual machines to suit customer requirements.
   The recommended approach is applied on Amazon's EC2 after three distinct
   experiments are assumed. The utility of the proposed method is further
   shown by the use of well-known optimization techniques for effective VM
   allocation. The app was created using a Java-based programming language
   and then run on the Netbeans IDE 12.4 platform.},

   Robotics, which tackles the issues for supporting daily activity,

   With recent advances in robotic development environments and in
   integrated multi-robot systems, robots are acquiring richer
   functionalities and robotic systems are becoming much easier to develop.
   However, such stand-alone robotic services are not enough for
   continuously and seamlessly supporting daily activity. We examine the
   requirements in typical daily supporting services through example
   scenarios that target senior citizens and the disabled. Based on these
   requirements, we discuss the key research issues in cloud network
   robotics. As a case study, a field experiment in a shopping mall shows
   how our proposed prototype infrastructure of cloud networked robotics
   enables multi-location robotic services for life support.},

   well-defined and structured access to the types and elements Of

   The information system transforms XML-based mathematical knowledge into
   a complex PROLOG-structure called field notation, which serves as the
   basis for building a digital library of fine-grained mathematical
   objects. Based on the field notation we provide a powerful and flexible
   declarative query language in a logic programming environment.},

Abstract = {The Semantic Web promises to open innumerable opportunities for
   automation and information retrieval by standardizing the protocols for
   metadata exchange. However, just as the success of the World Wide Web
   can be attributed to the ease of use and ubiquity of Web browsers, we
   believe that the unfolding of the Semantic Web vision depends on users
   getting powerful but easy-to-use tools for managing their information.
   But unlike HTML, which can be easily edited in any text editor, RDF is
   more complicated to author and does not have an obvious presentation
   mechanism. Previous work has concentrated on the ideas of generic RDF
   graph visualization and RDF Schema-based form generation. In this paper,
   we present a comprehensive platform for constructing end user
   applications that create, manipulate, and visualize arbitrary
   RDF-encoded information, adding another layer to the abstraction cake.
   We discuss a programming environment specifically designed for
   manipulating RDF and introduce user interface concepts on top that allow
   the developer to quickly assemble applications that are based on RDF
   data models. Also, because user interface specifications and program
   logic are themselves describable in RDF, applications built upon our
   framework enjoy properties such as network updatability, extensibility,
   and end user customizability - all desirable characteristics in the
   spirit of the Semantic Web.},

Title = {Minimizing the ripple effect of web-centric software by using the

Abstract = {The ripple effect metric shows what impact changes to a software will
   likely have on the rest of the system. In web-based data analysis, it
   has become a widespread practice to deploy both the script and the
   program developed with a high-level programming language software tool.
   Due to different vendors and the diversified philosophies behind
   different software tools, it may be slightly difficult to cope with the
   ripple effect across them. This paper initiates an experimental idea to
   minimize the wrapper interface ripple for web-based script tools and
   high-level programming environments and also indicates many potential
   research directions for the development of computationally intelligent
   tools in the software engineering domain that demand lower cost and less
   complexity. This work incorporates Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and its
   prime artifact pheromone, which has been modified as a pheromone
   extension module to minimize ripples when cross-coding. A standard
   benchmark data set has been taken to validate the performance of the
   proposed algorithm. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The article describes an IDE for functional programming, called WinHIPE.
   It provides an interactive and flexible tracer, as well as a powerful

   rewriting model of evaluation, and the latter provides automatic
   generation of visualizations and animations, friendly support for
   customization, maintenance and exportation of animations to the Web, and
   facilities to cope with large scale. Its main advantage over other
   visualization systems is an effortless approach to animation creation
   and maintenance, based on generating visualizations and animations
   automatically, as a side effect of program execution. Finally, we
   briefly describe our experience using the system during several years in
   educational settings.},

Year = {1993},
Volume = {115},

Abstract = {Many mechanical systems are sufficiently complex that it is impractical
   to describe their dynamics by exact mathematical models. In the presence
   of such modeling uncertainties, advanced controllers like adaptive
   controllers perform better than linear feedback controllers since they
   actively reduce the uncertainty by online parameter estimation.
   Unfortunately, the advanced control strategies, due to their lack of
   robustness, can become unstable in the presence of unpredictable
   external disturbances, and hence, there exists a need for a
   fault-tolerant approach to preserve the overall system integrity even at
   the cost of design performance. This motivated the research, presented
   in this paper, to investigate the suitability of the IDES (Influence
   Diagram Based Expert System) as an expert supervisory controller to
   predict incipient instability, a significant failure mode, and take
   corrective action in real-time when closed loop stability appears to be
   in danger. The expert supervisory control scheme is demonstrated on a
   model-referenced adaptive controller as applied to a robotic
   manipulator. The real-time expert system, with the information from
   sensors, dynamically optimizes the cost of control and as a result
   chooses between a robust auxiliary controller and the nonrobust adaptive
   controller depending on inferences made from the observable variables.
   IDES, as a real-time expert supervisory controller, preserves the
   stability of the system even under potentially destabilizing unexpected
   disturbances, exhibiting on demand a fault-tolerant behavior by trading
   design performance for overall system integrity. The results indicate
   the potential for influence diagram expert systems in monitoring and
   controlling mechanical systems where exact mathematical models are
   difficult or not practical to obtain.},

Abstract = {A highly sensitive, selective, reversible, and reusable glucose sensor
   is developed by using molecularly imprinted polymer-based artificial
   receptors onto interdigital transducer. Sensor receptors were
   synthesized through bulk imprinting technology by using styrene as
   monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as cross-linker, and
   AIBN as free radical initiator. Topography of the synthesized receptors
   was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fabricated
   sensor showed concentration-dependent linear and reversible response
   with lower limit of detection of 30 ppb and upper limit of detection
   similar to 500 ppm. Furthermore, newly fabricated sensor is highly
   selective towards its analyte of interest in the presence of other
   competing agents, and the regeneration of sensor response has been
   assessed with the percentage error of less than 2\% under the period of
   1 year at room temperature and pressure conditions. The reported sensor
   may have potential technological applications in the field of medical
   diagnostics, food, and pharmaceutical industry.},

Abstract = {Field inspection is a traditional way to detect the problem of shaft

   correction to the propulsion system online. In this study, Arduino IDE,
   InduSoft, and LabVIEW are used to create a function monitored by HMMI.
   By comparing the abnormal vibration amplification of the moment of
   inertia, HMMI calculates the correct mass to reduce the vibration. The
   experimental results show that, after HMMI carries out continuous active
   balance correction online, the correction rate achieves 105.37\%. This
   indicates that HMMI can calculate the amount of imbalance and phase
   angles and drive a counterweight to the correct balance position while
   the device is still operating.},

Abstract = {Interaction management is concerned with the protocols that govern
   structured interactive activities among multiple users or agents in
   networked collaborative environments. It is an important aspect of
   networked software in many application domains such as online meetings,
   online groupware and online games. However, there is limited support in
   most programming languages and programming environments for implementing
   interaction management. High-level features, such as interaction
   protocols and management policies, are usually hard coded by skilled
   network programmers, who are often scarce in many applications such as
   e-learning.
   In this paper, we present an abstraction of various collaborative
   applications in the form of the noughts and crosses game and its
   variations. We examine the needs in these games for programming
   interaction protocols, and propose a comprehensive collection of program
   constructs for supporting interaction. We report our efforts for
   incorporating these new constructs into JACIE (Java-based Authoring
   language for Collaborative Interactive Environments), an existing
   scripting language designed to support rapid prototyping and
   implementation of collaborative applications. We demonstrate, through
   variations of the noughts and crosses game and an on-line bridge game,
   the usefulness of these language constructs. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Web user interface (UI) test automation strategies have been dominated
   by programmable and record-playback approaches. Of these,
   record-playback allows creating automation tests easily and reduces the
   cost of test generation. However, this approach increases the cost of
   test maintenance due to its unstable generated locators for identifying
   UI objects during playback. In this paper, we propose a new approach to
   generating and selecting resilient and maintainable locators. Our
   approach consists of two parts, a new XPath construction method and
   selecting the best XPath to locate the target element. Our XPath
   construction method relies on semantic structures of Web pages to locate
   the target element using its neighbors. We conducted an experiment on 15
   popular websites. The results show that our approach outperforms the
   state-of-the-practice/art Selenium IDE and Robula+ in locating target
   elements by effectively avoiding wrong locators. It also produces more
   readable XPaths (hence more maintainable tests) than do these
   approaches.},

Abstract = {Proteins carry out the most fundamental processes of life such as
   cellular metabolism, regulation, and communication. Understanding these
   processes at a molecular level requires knowledge of their
   three-dimensional structures. Experimental techniques such as X-ray
   crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and cryogenic electron microscopy can
   resolve protein structures but are costly and time-consuming and do not
   work for all proteins. Computational protein structure prediction tries
   to overcome these problems by predicting the structure of a new protein
   using existing protein structures as a resource. Here we present
   TopSuite, a web server for protein model quality assessment (TopScore)
   and template-based protein structure prediction (TopModel). TopScore
   provides meta-predictions for global and residue-wise model quality
   estimation using deep neural networks. TopModel predicts protein
   structures using a top-down consensus approach to aid the template
   selection and subsequently uses TopScore to refine and assess the
   predicted structures. The TopSuite Web server is freely available at
   https://cpclab.uni-duesseidorf.ide/topsuite/.},

Abstract = {Named entities (e.g., ``Kofi Annan{''}, ``Coca-Cola{''}, ``Second World
   War{''}) are ubiquitous in web pages and other types of document and
   often provide a simplified picture of the document's content. We present
   an ontology currently containing 31,000 named entities in different
   languages from various domains such as history, geography, politics,
   sports, arts, etc., which is being developed at the University of Munich
   (LMU). The underlying graph data model is simple and yet extremely
   versatile in different application scenarios. We demonstrate a prototype
   of a graphical interface to both the ontology and to documents on the
   web or in a local document repository, with a tight interaction in both
   directions. Occurrences of concepts from the ontology are highlighted
   and hyperlinked in the documents. Unrecognized entities could be added
   to the database and related to other concepts in a semiautomatic
   process. The entity database can also be used for extending full-text
   queries on the web or the repository to semantically close documents,
   and for indexing different kinds of named entities in the document
   repository. Similar to a programming IDE, the system illustrates how
   integrated browsing, search and update functionality contributes to the
   construction of high-quality ontologies, fundamental to the vision of a
   truly ``semantic{''} web.},

Abstract = {Several genetic loci (JAZF1, CDC123/CAMK1D, TSPAN8/LGR5, ADAMTS9, VEGFA
   and HHEX-IDE) were identified to be significantly related to the risk of
   type 2 diabetes and quantitative metabolic traits in European
   populations. Here, we aimed to evaluate the impacts of these novel loci
   on type 2 diabetes risk in a population-based case-control study of Han
   Chinese (1912 cases and 2041 controls). We genotyped 13
   single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in/near these genes and examined
   the differences in allele/genotype frequency between cases and controls.
   We found that both IDE rs11187007 and HHEX rs1111875 were associated
   with type 2 diabetes risk (for both variants: odds ratio (OR)=1.15, 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.28, P=0.009). In a meta-analysis where
   we pooled our data with the three previous studies conducted in East
   Asians, we found that the variants of JAZF1 rs864745 (1.09 (1.03-1.16);
   P=3.49x10(-3)) and TSPAN8/LGR5 rs7961581 (1.11 (1.05-1.17);
   P=1.89x10(-4)) were significantly associated with type 2 diabetes risk.
   In addition, the meta-analysis (7207 cases and 8260 controls) also
   showed that HHEX rs1111875 did have effects on type 2 diabetes in
   Chinese population (OR=1.15(1.10-1.21); P=1.93x10(-8)). This large
   population-based study and meta-analysis further confirmed the modest
   effects of the JAZF1, TSPAN8/LGR5 and HHEX-IDE loci on type 2 diabetes
   in Chinese and other East Asians. Journal of Human Genetics (2010) 55,

Title = {Pangea: An MLOps Tool for Automatically Generating Infrastructure and
   Deploying Analytic Pipelines in Edge, Fog and Cloud Layers},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Development and operations (DevOps), artificial intelligence (AI), big
   data and edge-fog-cloud are disruptive technologies that may produce a
   radical transformation of the industry. Nevertheless, there are still
   major challenges to efficiently applying them in order to optimise
   productivity. Some of them are addressed in this article, concretely,
   with respect to the adequate management of information technology (IT)
   infrastructures for automated analysis processes in critical fields such
   as the mining industry. In this area, this paper presents a tool called
   Pangea aimed at automatically generating suitable execution environments
   for deploying analytic pipelines. These pipelines are decomposed into
   various steps to execute each one in the most suitable environment
   (edge, fog, cloud or on-premise) minimising latency and optimising the
   use of both hardware and software resources. Pangea is focused in three
   distinct objectives: (1) generating the required infrastructure if it
   does not previously exist; (2) provisioning it with the necessary
   requirements to run the pipelines (i.e., configuring each host operative
   system and software, install dependencies and download the code to
   execute); and (3) deploying the pipelines. In order to facilitate the
   use of the architecture, a representational state transfer application
   programming interface (REST API) is defined to interact with it.
   Therefore, in turn, a web client is proposed. Finally, it is worth
   noting that in addition to the production mode, a local development
   environment can be generated for testing and benchmarking purposes.},

Abstract = {For many organizations today, maintaining hypertext documents is
   becoming a burdensome task in its own right. The development process for
   hypertext documents is also starting to resemble that of software, with
   increasingly complex analysis of hypertext documents' ability to meet an
   organization's needs, well-planned design and implementation, and
   follow-up testing fur consistency and effectiveness.
   Software maintenance is a major problem, and hypertext documents share
   many of the characteristics of software. Yet according to the authors'
   review of the summaries of 52 Web development tools, only six contained
   maintenance-related terms or features.
   The situation is made more critical because Web development has
   attracted a mixed community of professional and nonprofessional
   developers.
   In this article, the authors compare the characteristics of software and
   hypertext documents. They derive lessons from software development that
   can be applied to the creation and maintenance of hypertext documents,
   in terms of structure, reuse, testing, version management, development
   tools, and development processes.},

Abstract = {We propose a specification-driven approach to Web service composition.
   Our framework allows the users (or service developers) to start with a
   high-level, possibly incomplete specification of a desired (goal)
   service that is to be realized using a subset of the available component
   services. These services are represented using labeled transition
   systems augmented with guards over variables with infinite domains and
   are used to determine a strategy for their composition that would
   realize the goal service functionality. However, in the event the goal
   service cannot be realized using the available services, our approach
   identifies the cause(s) for such failure which can then be used by the
   developer to reformulate the goal specification. Thus, the technique
   supports Web service composition through iterative reformulation of the
   functional specification. We present a prototype implementation in a
   tabled-logic programming environment that illustrates the key features

Abstract = {At every software design stage nowadays, there is an acute need to solve
   the problem of effective choice of libraries, development technologies,
   data exchange formats, virtual environment systems, characteristics of
   virtual machines. Due to the spread of various kinds of devices and the
   popularity of Web platforms, lots of systems are developed not for the
   universal installation on a device (box version), but for a specific
   architecture with the subsequent provision of web services. Under these
   conditions, the only way for estimating the efficiency parameters at the
   design stage is to conduct various kinds of experiments to evaluate the
   parameters of a particular solution. Using the example of the Web
   platform of digital psychological tools, the methods for experimental
   parameter evaluation were developed in the article. The mechanisms and
   technologies for improving the efficiency of the Vagrant and Docker
   cloud virtual environment were also proposed in the paper. A set of
   basic criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the configuration of
   the virtual development environment has been determined to be rapid
   deployment; increase in the speed and decrease in the volume of
   resources used; increase in the speed of data exchange between the host
   machine and the virtual machine. The results of experimental estimates
   of the parameters that define the formulated efficiency criteria are
   given as: processor utilization involved (percentage); the amount of RAM
   involved (GB); initialization time of virtual machines (seconds); time
   to assemble the component completely (Build) and to reassemble the
   component (Watch) (seconds). To improve the efficiency, a file system
   access driver based on the NFS protocol was studied in the paper.},

Abstract = {Objective
   To compare the efficacy of tenofovir and entecavir in nucleos(t)ide
   analogue-naive chronic hepatitis B.
   Methods
   The Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Clinical Trials
   and China National Knowledge Infrastructure(CNKI) databases were
   electronically searched to collect randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
   regarding the comparison between tenofovir and entecavir in
   nucleos(t)ide analogue-naive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) since the date of
   database inception to July 2019. Two researchers independently screened
   and evaluated the obtained studies and extracted the outcome indexes.
   RevMan 5.3 software was used for the meta-analysis.
   Results
   Early on, tenofovir had a greater ability to inhibit the hepatitis B
   virus, I-2 = 0\% {[}RR = 1.08, 95\% CI (1.03, 1.13), P<0.01] (96 weeks).
   Entecavir can normalize the ALT levels earlier, I-2 = 0\% {[}RR = 0.87,
   95\% CI (0.77, 0.98), P = 0.02] (48 weeks). However, there was no
   statistically significant difference between TDF and ETV at 144 weeks.
   Tenofovir was as effective as entecavir in terms of HBeAg clearance and
   HBeAg seroconversion, I-2 = 0\% {[}RR = 1.05, 95\% CI (0.68, 1.62), P =
   0.82]; I-2 = 69\% {[}RR = 0.93, 95\% CI (0.54, 1.61), P = 0.80]. The
   difference in the incidence of elevated creatine kinase levels was not
   statistically significant I-2 = 0\% {[}RR = 0.66, 95\% CI (0.27, 1.60),
   P = 0.35].
   Conclusions
   Tenofovir and entecavir were equally effective in the treatment of
   patients with nucleos(t)ide analogue-naive chronic hepatitis B. In
   addition, TDF has an advantage in the incidence of hepatocellular
   carcinoma. Additional RCTs and a large-sample prospective cohort study
   should be performed.},

Abstract = {Software programming is one of the key abilities for the development of
   Computational Thinking (CT) skills in Science, Technology, Engineering
   and Mathematics (STEM). However, specific software tools to emulate
   realistic scenarios are required for effective teaching. Unfortunately,
   these tools have some limitations in educational environments due to the
   need of an adequate configuration and orchestration, which usually
   assumes an unaffordable work overload for teachers and is inaccessible
   for students outside the laboratories. To mitigate the aforementioned
   limitations, we rely on cloud solutions that automate the process of
   orchestration and configuration of software tools on top of cloud
   computing infrastructures. This way, the paper presents ACTaaS as a
   cloud-based educational resource that deploys and orchestrates a whole
   realistic software programming environment. ACTaaS provides a simple,
   fast and automatic way to set up a professional integrated environment
   without involving an overload to the teacher, and it provides an
   ubiquitous access to the environment. The solution has been tested in a
   pilot group of 28 students. Currently, there is no tool like ACTaaS that
   allows such a high grade of automation for the deployment of software
   production environments focused on educational activities supporting a
   wide range of cloud providers. Preliminary results through a pilot group
   predict its effectiveness due to the efficiency to set up a class
   environment in minutes without overloading the teachers, and providing
   ubiquitous access to students. In addition, the first student opinions
   about the experience were greatly positive.},

Title = {Understanding the motivations, challenges and needs of Blockchain
   software developers: a survey},

Abstract = {The blockchain technology has potential applications in various areas
   such as smart-contracts, Internet of Things (IoT), land registry, supply
   chain management, storing medical data, and identity management.
   Although GitHub currently hosts more than six thousand active Blockchain
   software (BCS) projects, few software engineering researchers have
   investigated these projects and their contributors. Although the number
   of BCS projects is growing rapidly, the motivations, challenges, and
   needs of BCS developers remain a puzzle. Therefore, the primary
   objective of this study is to understand the motivations, challenges,
   and needs of BCS developers and analyze the differences between BCS and
   non-BCS development. On this goal, we sent an online survey to 1,604
   active BCS developers identified by mining the GitHub repositories of
   145 popular BCS projects. The survey received 156 responses that met our
   criteria for analysis. The results suggest that the majority of the BCS
   developers are experienced in non-BCS development and are primarily
   motivated by the ideology of creating a decentralized financial system.
   Although most of the BCS projects are Open Source Software (OSS)
   projects by nature, more than 93\% of our respondents found BCS
   development somewhat different from a non-BCS development as BCS
   projects have higher emphasis on security and reliability than most of
   the non-BCS projects. Other differences include: higher costs of
   defects, decentralized and hostile environment, technological
   complexity, and difficulty in upgrading the software after release.
   These differences were also the primary sources of challenges to them.
   Software development tools that are tuned for non-BCS development are
   inadequate for BCS and the ecosystem needs an array of new or improved
   tools, such as: customized IDE for BCS development tasks, debuggers for
   smart-contracts, testing support, easily deployable simulators, and BCS
   domain specific design notations.},

Abstract = {We report an exploratory research project that investigates the impacts
   of different forms of design planning on end users asked to develop a
   simple interactive web application. End users created their projects (a
   Ride Board application) using the CLICK end-user web development tool
   {[}J. Rode, User-centered design of end-user web development tool, Ph.D.
   Dissertation, Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg,
   VA, USA, 2005]. Some participants were asked to create a conceptual map
   to plan their projects and others to write user interaction scenarios; a
   third group was asked to do whatever they found useful. We describe the
   planning that each group underwent, how they approached the web
   development task, and their reactions to the experience afterwards. The
   overall pattern of results suggests that while the participants who
   planned using scenarios felt they better understood the web development
   task, it was the group who created concept maps that explored and
   incorporated more of the novel programming features of the CLICK tool.
   We also discuss the role of gender in the CLICK development task, noting
   that women were less likely to explore the tool's novel features and
   perceived themselves as less successful in the task. We conclude with a
   discussion of design implications and future work. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Title = {ChIPpeakAnno: a Bioconductor package to annotate ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip
   data},
Journal = {BMC BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAY 11},
Abstract = {Background: Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by
   high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) or ChIP followed by genome tiling
   array analysis (ChIP-chip) have become standard technologies for
   genome-wide identification of DNA-binding protein target sites. A number
   of algorithms have been developed in parallel that allow identification
   of binding sites from ChIP-seq or ChIP-chip datasets and subsequent
   visualization in the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome
   Browser as custom annotation tracks. However, summarizing these tracks
   can be a daunting task, particularly if there are a large number of
   binding sites or the binding sites are distributed widely across the
   genome.
   Results: We have developed ChIPpeakAnno as a Bioconductor package within
   the statistical programming environment R to facilitate batch annotation
   of enriched peaks identified from ChIP-seq, ChIP-chip, cap analysis of
   gene expression (CAGE) or any experiments resulting in a large number of
   enriched genomic regions. The binding sites annotated with ChIPpeakAnno
   can be viewed easily as a table, a pie chart or plotted in histogram
   form, i.e., the distribution of distances to the nearest genes for each
   set of peaks. In addition, we have implemented functionalities for
   determining the significance of overlap between replicates or binding
   sites among transcription factors within a complex, and for drawing Venn
   diagrams to visualize the extent of the overlap between replicates.
   Furthermore, the package includes functionalities to retrieve sequences
   flanking putative binding sites for PCR amplification, cloning, or motif
   discovery, and to identify Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with
   adjacent genes.
   Conclusions: ChIPpeakAnno enables batch annotation of the binding sites
   identified from ChIP-seq, ChIP-chip, CAGE or any technology that results
   in a large number of enriched genomic regions within the statistical
   programming environment R. Allowing users to pass their own annotation
   data such as a different Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
   preparation and a dataset from literature, or existing annotation
   packages, such as GenomicFeatures and BSgenome, provides flexibility.
   Tight integration to the biomaRt package enables up-to-date annotation
   retrieval from the BioMart database.},

Abstract = {To interpret whole exome/genome sequence data for clinical and research
   purposes, comprehensive phenotypic information, knowledge of pedigree
   structure, and results of previous clinical testing are essential. With
   these requirements in mind and to meet the needs of the Centers for
   Mendelian Genomics project, we have developed PhenoDB
   (http://phenodb.net), a secure, Web-based portal for entry, storage, and
   analysis of phenotypic and other clinical information. The phenotypic
   features are organized hierarchically according to the major headings
   and subheadings of the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM (R))
   clinical synopses, with further subdivisions according to structure and
   function. Every string allows for a free-text entry. All of the
   approximately 2,900 features use the preferred term from Elements of
   Morphology and are fully searchable and mapped to the Human Phenotype
   Ontology and Elements of Morphology. The PhenoDB allows for
   ascertainment of relevant information from a case in a family or cohort,
   which is then searchable by family, OMIM number, phenotypic feature,
   mode of inheritance, genes screened, and so on. The database can also be
   used to format phenotypic data for submission to dbGaP for appropriately
   consented individuals. PhenoDB was built using Django, an open source

Abstract = {Background JNJ-73763989 (JNJ-3989), a small interfering RNA, targets all
   hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNAs, reducing all HBV proteins. JNJ-56136379
   (JNJ-6379; also known as bersacapavir), a capsid assembly modulator,
   inhibits HBV replication. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy (ie,
   antiviral activity) and safety of these therapeutics in combination with
   nucleos(t)ide analogues in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Methods
   The REEF-1 multicentre, double-blind, active-controlled, randomised,
   phase 2b study was done at 108 hospitals or outpatient centres across 19
   countries in Asia, Europe, and North and South America. We included
   patients aged 18-65 years with chronic hepatitis B (defined as HBsAg
   positivity at screening and at least 6 months before screening or
   alternative markers of chronicity {[}eg, HBV DNA]), including those not
   currently treated, virologically suppressed, HBeAg positive, and HBeAg
   negative. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:2:2:2:2) via permuted
   block randomisation according to a computer-generated schedule to
   receive oral nucleos(t)ide analogues once per day plus placebo (control
   group); oral JNJ-6379 250 mg daily plus nucleos(t)ide analogues
   (JNJ-6379 dual group); nucleos(t)ide analogues plus subcutaneously
   injected JNJ-3989 at doses of 40 mg (JNJ-3989 dual 40 mg group), 100 mg
   (JNJ-3989 dual 100 mg group), or 200 mg (JNJ-3989 dual 200 mg group)
   every 4 weeks; or JNJ-6379 250 mg plus JNJ-3989 100 mg every 4 weeks
   plus nucleos(t)ide analogues (triple group) for 48 weeks followed by a
   follow-up phase. An interactive web response system provided concealed
   treatment allocation, and investigators remained masked to the
   intervention groups until the primary analysis at week 48. The primary
   endpoint was the proportion of patients meeting predefined nucleos(t)ide
   analogue-stopping criteria (alanine aminotransferase <3 x upper limit of
   normal, HBV DNA below the lower limit of quantitation, HBeAg negative,
   and HBsAg <10 IU/mL) at week 48. All patients who received at least one
   dose of study drug were included in the analysis population used for
   primary efficacy assessment, excluding those who withdrew because of
   COVID-19-related reasons, withdrew before week 44, or had no efficacy
   data (ie, the modified intention-to-treat population). Safety was
   assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of study
   drugs. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03982186.
   The study has been completed.Findings Between Aug 1, 2019, and April 26,
   2022, 470 patients (310 {[}66\%] male and 244 {[}52\%] White) were
   randomly assigned: 45 to the control group, 48 to the JNJ-6379 dual

Title = {X-ray imaging virtual online laboratory for engineering undergraduates},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Distance learning engineering students (as well as those in face-to-face
   settings) should acquire a basic background in radiation-matter
   interaction physics (usually in the first semesters). Some students in
   this group may feel some degree of aversion towards these types of pure
   science-related subjects (mathematics, physics, chemistry, etc). In
   online learning scenarios, the average student is already an adult (37
   years old or above) and may see no particular application of the
   aforementioned courses in their current or future professional life.
   Besides this, online institutions tend to lean too much on applet-based
   simulations. Although they may shed some light on the theory associated
   with the studied physical processes, these animated and interactive
   examples also seem to be ` stripped down' versions of the real events,
   and are felt to be disconnected from current scientific environments and
   engineering settings. For this reason, we describe a novel virtual lab
   approach to teach the basics of the low-energy interactions present in
   average x-ray settings. It combines real scientific simulation
   frameworks with modern computing techniques such as virtualization,
   cloud infrastructures, containers, networking and shared collaboration
   environments. It also fosters the use of hugely demanded development
   tools and programming languages and addresses the fundamentals of
   digital radiography and the linked electronic standards for image
   storage and transmission. With this mixed approach, blending scientific
   concepts, healthcare and state-of-the-art software solutions, our
   virtual labs have proven (over a period of five academic terms) to be
   both very attractive to and pedagogically successful (technically, and
   scientifically) for online engineering undergraduates. For the sake of
   completeness, we also propose a hands-on activity that mimics the
   geometrical peculiarities of x-ray rooms with the help of visible light
   and cheap materials.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the design and evaluation of a Web-based
   collaborative learning environment called EduCo for learning and
   practicing team-based exercises in computer science and software
   engineering courses. EduCo's defining characteristic is integrating a
   number of services for software development activities, for example,
   project management, requirements engineering, design, and programming
   into integrated shared workspaces with social-networking facilities to
   enhance collaboration among students and instructors. We conducted a
   controlled experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of the system in
   doing a three-iteration programming project. A total of 126 second-year
   students who attended an object-oriented programming course participated
   in the experiment. The results show that while the system was not found
   to affect student programming performance, it improved student
   engagement and satisfaction when working in teams. These results imply
   that the system's shared workspaces and social-networking services have
   the potential to enhance learning outcomes of students working in teams
   when these features are integrated into collaborative learning
   environments. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Comput Appl Eng Educ

Title = {Evaluating software engineering techniques for developing complex
   systems with multiagent approaches},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {53},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {494-506},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Context: Multiagent systems (MAS) allow complex systems to be developed
   in which autonomous and heterogeneous entities interact. Currently,
   there are a great number of methods and frameworks for developing MAS.
   The selection of one or another development environment is a crucial
   part of the development process. Therefore, the evaluation and
   comparison of MAS software engineering techniques is necessary in order
   to make the selection of the development environment easier.
   Objective: The main goal of this paper is to define an evaluation
   framework that will help in facilitating, standardizing, and simplifying
   the evaluation, analysis, and comparison of MAS development
   environments. Moreover, the final objective of the proposed tool is to
   provide a repository of the most commonly used MAS software engineering
   methods and tools.
   Method: The proposed framework analyzes methods and tools through a set
   of criteria that are related to both system engineering dimensions and
   MAS features. Also, the support for developing organizational and
   service-oriented MAS is studied. This framework is implemented as an
   online application to improve its accessibility.
   Results: In this paper, we present Masev, which is an evaluation
   framework for MAS software engineering. It allows MAS methods,
   techniques and environments to be analyzed and compared. A case study of
   the analysis of four methodologies is presented.
   Conclusion: It is concluded that Masev simplifies the evaluation and
   comparison task and summarizes the most important issues for developing
   MAS, organizational MAS, and service-oriented MAS. Therefore, it could
   help developers to select the most appropriate MAS method and tools for
   developing a specific system, and it could be used for MAS software
   engineering developers to detect and deficiencies in their methods and
   tools. Also, developers of new tools can understand this application as
   a way to publish their tools and demonstrate what their contributions
   are to the state of the art. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Web sites and web browsers have recently evolved into platforms on top
   of which entire applications are delivered dynamically, mostly as
   JavaScript source code. This delivery format has sparked extremely
   enthusiastic efforts to customize both individual web sites and entire
   browsers in ways the original authors never expected or accommodated.
   Such customizations take the form of yet more script dynamically
   injected into the application, and the current idioms to do so exploit
   arcane JavaScript features and are extremely brittle. In this work, we
   accept the popularity of extensions and seek better linguistic
   mechanisms to support them.
   We suggest adding to JavaScript aspect-oriented features that allow
   straightforward and declarative ways for customization code to modify
   the targeted application. Compared to most prior aspect-related
   research, our work has a different motivation and a different target
   programming environment, both of which lead to novel design and
   implementation techniques. Our aspect weaving is entirely integrated
   into a new dynamic JIT compiler, which lets us properly handle advice to
   first-class functions in the presence of arbitrary aliasing, without
   resorting to whole-program code transformations. Our prototype
   demonstrates that an aspect-oriented approach to web-application
   customization is often more efficient than current idioms while
   simplifying the entire process.},

   web applications},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTER LANGUAGES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {75},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Because of their level of abstraction, Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs)
   enable building applications that ease software implementation. In the
   context of web applications, we can find a lot of technologies and
   programming languages for server-side applications that provide fast,
   robust, and flexible solutions, whereas those for client-side
   applications are limited, and mostly restricted to directly use
   JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, JSON and XML. This article presents a novel
   approach to creating DSL-based web applications using JSON grammar
   (JSON-DSL) for both, the server and client side. The approach includes
   an evaluation engine, a programming model and an integrated web
   development environment that support it. The evaluation engine allows
   the execution of the elements created with the programming model. For
   its part, the programming model allows the definition and specification
   of JSON-DSLs, the implementation of JavaScript components, the use of
   JavaScript templates provided by the engine, the use of link connectors
   to heterogeneous information sources, and the integration with other
   widgets, web components and JavaScript frameworks. To validate the
   strength and capacity of our approach, we have developed four case
   studies that use the integrated web development environment to apply the
   programming model and check the results within the evaluation engine.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Universities in developing countries and maybe a few in some developed
   countries are faced with the challenge of adopting an effective pedagogy
   for teaching Computer Programming Languages to students. This is due to
   lack of technological infrastructure and a number of peculiar
   limitations within these regions. The goal of this paper is twofold,
   conducting a systematic review of related literature in Programming
   Languages and proposing a model for teaching Programming Languages
   effectively given sparse resources. On the systematic review, a search
   for literature from 4 databases using appropriate inclusion and
   exclusion techniques yielded 18 relevant research articles. Based on
   gaps found in literature, we propose an effective teaching approach that
   integrates teaching basic foundational aspects of programming, teaching
   students how to represent computing problems using these foundational
   concepts and using mobile compilers to compile their codes on the event
   that systems are not available. A few initial empirical results showing
   the effect of the adoption of a mobile tool for teaching Programming to
   undergraduate students are presented. This research recommends the
   adoption of an Online Console Compiler as the mobile Integration
   Development Environment (IDE). It also recommends some Programming
   Languages that should be adopted in teaching students from first year to
   fourth year using the National University Commission's (NUC) guidelines,
   course outlines from four Universities and data from Universities in
   developed countries. Care should be taken in the use of mobile phones as
   there are safety rules in some developed countries on the minimal set of
   acceptable systems for programmers. Recommendations for future research
   are discussed. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on

Abstract = {The main purpose of this study was ranking cloud computing criteria in
   developing electronic communications services using multiple-criteria
   decision analysis methodology (MCDM). This correlational research was
   applied in terms of purpose. Statistical population of the study
   included ICT experts of the steel industry in Yazd province (industrial
   experts), among which, 312 individuals were selected using purposeful
   nonprobability (judgmental) sampling method. Considering the conducted
   investigations and critically reviewing the related books and articles,
   the variables, criteria, and scales were identified using cloud
   computing technology. To analyze the data, MCDM and fuzzy logic
   calculations were utilized in Expert Choice software. According to the
   results and considering fuzzy calculations related to the capabilities
   of cloud computing in developing electronic communications services, the
   most important criteria in the ``IT management in steel industries{''}
   cluster having (A) network code was ``communicating with steel
   industries'costumers{''} having (AB) network code and fuzzy network
   weight equal to 0.096; the most important criteria in `` cloud computing

Abstract = {This paper presents a semi-automatic approach for the recovery and
   evolution of the design of existing Web applications. The proposed
   approach is structured in two main phases and is based on the Ubiquitous
   Web Applications (UWA) design framework, a methodology and a set of
   models and tools for the user-centered design of multichannel
   context-aware Web applications. In the first phase a representative set
   of the application's front-end Web pages are analyzed to abstract the
   as-is' design model of the application according to the UWA methodology.
   In the second phase, the recovered design model is evolved to define the
   to be' version of it. This evolution activity considers the up-to-date
   requirements available for the application and UWA design guidelines to
   identify shortcomings and opportunities of improvement in the as-is'
   design. The reverse modeling phase exploits clustering and clone
   detection techniques and is supported by the RE-UWA tool, an Eclipse IDE
   customized to implement the reverse engineering process defined to
   extract formal UWA models expressed as instances of a MOF metamodel. The
   forward design phase is supported by a set of UWA modeling tools that
   are built on top of the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and the Eclipse
   Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF). The proposed design recovery and
   evolution approach is applied to four real-world Web applications and
   the obtained results are also presented in the paper. Copyright (c) 2012

Title = {AgTC and AgETL: open-source tools to enhance data collection and
   management for plant science research},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Month = {FEB 21},
Abstract = {Advancements in phenotyping technology have enabled plant science
   researchers to gather large volumes of information from their
   experiments, especially those that evaluate multiple genotypes. To fully
   leverage these complex and often heterogeneous data sets (i.e. those
   that differ in format and structure), scientists must invest
   considerable time in data processing, and data management has emerged as
   a considerable barrier for downstream application. Here, we propose a
   pipeline to enhance data collection, processing, and management from
   plant science studies comprising of two newly developed open-source
   programs. The first, called AgTC, is a series of programming functions
   that generates comma-separated values file templates to collect data in
   a standard format using either a lab-based computer or a mobile device.
   The second series of functions, AgETL, executes steps for an
   Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) data integration process where data are
   extracted from heterogeneously formatted files, transformed to meet
   standard criteria, and loaded into a database. There, data are stored
   and can be accessed for data analysis-related processes, including
   dynamic data visualization through web-based tools. Both AgTC and AgETL
   are flexible for application across plant science experiments without
   programming knowledge on the part of the domain scientist, and their
   functions are executed on Jupyter Notebook, a browser-based interactive
   development environment. Additionally, all parameters are easily
   customized from central configuration files written in the
   human-readable YAML format. Using three experiments from research
   laboratories in university and non-government organization (NGO)
   settings as test cases, we demonstrate the utility of AgTC and AgETL to
   streamline critical steps from data collection to analysis in the plant
   sciences.},

Abstract = {Web Service (WS) has been widely accepted in recent years. It is
   becoming the next paradigm to deploy business services on the Web.
   However, building WS is not an easy task due to the complexity of
   various business processes and different communication protocols. In
   this paper, we propose a methodology to efficiently develop Web Services
   by plugging in software agents. This agent oriented method uses software
   agents as building blocks of WS, and exploits the commonly available
   agent development tools to accelerate the whole development cycle.
   Software agents in this methodology not only implement the business
   processes, but also enrich the functions of WS. Our approach provides a
   solution for Web Service engineering. A case study in loan application
   service is presented to show the benefits and advantages of this agent
   oriented service engineering methodology.},

   object-orientation on the Web and thus facilitating the use of
   well-known software development tools.
   WebComposition is a method based on object-oriented decomposition of Web
   applications into fine-grained components, which serve as units for
   composition, sharing, abstraction, reuse, and evolution of Web-based
   applications. The method uses a Component Store for persistent storage
   of the component model, and a Resource Generator for automated mapping

   present XGuide, a practical guide for XML-based Web Engineering that

Abstract = {The core of a dynamic digital map (DDM) is a program created to display
   a digital geologic map and its associated data set as a single
   integrated package. This DDM program core is authored using a high-level
   object oriented graphical programming environment, SuperCard, a
   Macintosh `xTalk' language. Some of the major philosophical
   underpinnings relevant to the job of creating DDMs in this programming
   environment include taking advantage of specific object's attributes,
   how to organize data structure effectively for this job and keeping
   applicable code as transportable (generalized) as possible between
   objects. The core components of DDMs are parts of a SuperCard `template'
   or map display `container' into which the various externally created
   digital pieces (e.g. CAD produced geologic maps, spread sheet data,
   digital images, text files, movies) can be inserted for integrated
   display and digital publication. Components of DDMs consist of windows,
   cards within these windows, card fields (text and data containers) and a
   menu structure. The paper discusses each of these major components and
   how they fit into a DDM and gives examples of each topic in programs
   whose components demonstrate the concept. These programs are available
   from Web (see Appendix A); readers can refer to them as they examine
   these examples. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A service relation model for web-based land cover change detection},
Journal = {ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {132},
Pages = {20-32},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Change detection with remotely sensed imagery is a critical step in land
   cover monitoring and updating. Although a variety of algorithms or
   models have been developed, none of them can be universal for all cases.
   The selection of appropriate algorithms and construction of processing
   workflows depend largely on the expertise of experts about the
   ``algorithm-data{''} relations among change detection algorithms and the
   imagery data used. This paper presents a service relation model for land
   cover change detection by integrating the experts' knowledge about the
   ``algorithm-data{''} relations into the web-based geo-processing. The
   ``algorithm-data{''} relations are mapped into a set of web service
   relations with the analysis of functional and non-functional service
   semantics. These service relations are further classified into three
   different levels, i.e., interface, behavior and execution levels. A
   service relation model is then established using the Object and Relation
   Diagram (ORD) approach to represent the multi-granularity services and
   their relations for change detection. A set of semantic matching rules
   are built and used for deriving on-demand change detection service
   chains from the service relation model. A web-based prototype system is
   developed in. NET development environment, which encapsulates nine
   change detection and pre-processing algorithms and represents their
   service relations as an ORD. Three test areas from Shandong and Hebei
   provinces, China with different imagery conditions are selected for

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Nowadays, a trending technology that provides a virtualized computer
   resources based on the internet is named as cloud computing, these
   clouds performance mostly depends on the various factors among the load
   balancing. The allocation of the dynamic workload in between the cloud
   systems and equally shares the resources so that no database server is
   overloaded or under loaded is technically referred to as load balancing
   (LB). Therefore, in cloud an active load balancing scheme can perhaps
   enhance the reliability, services and the utilization of resources as
   well. In this manuscript, the benefits are integrated for Harries Hawks
   Optimization and Pigeon inspired Optimization Algorithm to create
   efficient load balancing scheme, which ensures the optimal resources
   utilizations with tasks response time. The proposed approach is
   implemented in JAVA Net beans IDE incorporated in the cloudsim framework
   that is analyzed based on different number of task in order to assess
   the performance. However, the simulation outcomes demonstrate that the
   proposed Hawks Optimization and Pigeon inspired Optimization algorithm
   based load balancing scheme is significantly balance the load optimally
   amid the Virtual Machines within a shorter period of time than the
   existing algorithms. The efficiency of the proposed method is 97\%
   compared to the other existing methods. The computational time, cost,
   throughput analysis, make span, latency, execution time are determined
   and gets analysed, compared with the Harries Hawks Optimization, Spider
   Monkey Algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization and Honey Bee Optimization.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a new technological evolution of the Sucre project,
   which aims to foster a vocation for science and develop computational
   thinking and programming skills in pre-university students. This
   improved version is called Sucre4Stem and has been designed from the
   Internet of Things perspective. At a technological level, we
   differentiate two main tools, SucreCore andSucreCode. SucreCore provides
   a new, more compact design, encapsulates an advanced microcontroller and
   supports wireless connectivity with the ability to create online
   variables and functions. SucreCode, the block-based visual programming
   tool, has a revamped interface and allows wireless communication with
   SucreCore. At the pedagogical level, Sucre4Stem makes it easier to
   implement new group dynamics and to create novel types of collaborative
   projects between groups of students. In this article, we also explore
   how these collaborative projects can be carried out by taking advantage
   of' the different types of communications between SucreCore and the
   server-side platform using shared online variables and functions.},

Journal = {CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE \& EXPERIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {34},

Abstract = {Cloud computing is the on-demand access to computer resources such as
   applications, servers, data storage, development tools, networking
   capabilities, and other resources that are held in a remote data center
   maintained by a cloud services provider(CSP) and accessible over the
   internet. The limited resources and higher time consumption are the
   major issues faced by cloud users. The appropriate selection of virtual
   machines (VMs) is used to maximize cloud resource usage and reduce task
   execution time for the clients (patients, physicians, etc.). In this
   article, we have introduced an efficient cloud-based healthcare services
   paradigm (HCS). The opposition-based Laplacian equilibrium optimizer
   (O-LEO) algorithm is used to select optimal VMs in which the
   maximization of resource utilization and minimization of task execution
   time is performed. Additionally, the boosted support vector machine
   (SVM) effectively predicts chronic kidney disease (CKD) thereby ensuring
   better prediction results. The CloudSim platform is used as the
   implementation platform of the proposed method. The overall time taken
   by the O-LEO-based CloudSim is less than the standard Cloud Sim model to
   create three cloudlets which improve the system efficiency by 6\%. When
   compared with the existing techniques, both the O-LEO and boosted SVM
   classifier outperforms superior performances.},

   tools in the classroom. In the study, 33 students were divided into 13
   groups and each group used the three tools to develop three independent

Abstract = {In academic research laboratories, well-organized group meetings are
   common training tools that can benefit individuals and the group as a

   increasingly important format for research group meetings. Virtual
   meeting formats also offer an important and underappreciated advantage:
   ease of collaboration with researchers at other (potentially distant)
   institutions. Herein, we describe the strategies we employed to
   facilitate engaging and productive online meetings and academic
   exchanges between environmental chemistry/engineering laboratories at a
   primarily undergraduate program and a doctoral research intensive
   institution. Over a period of 12 months, six intermural group meetings
   were held through videoconference. All meetings consisted of two
   segments: (1) a literature or research discussion and (2) a professional
   development session that emphasized topics such as navigating life after
   completing a bachelor's degree, advice on securing graduate school
   admission and funding, and characteristics of effective instructors
   (from the undergraduate perspective). Student-led discussion of
   scientific literature and research is valuable in enhancing trainees'
   communication skills, interdisciplinary perspectives, and critical
   reading of the literature. Professional development sessions facilitate
   unique opportunities for professional mentorship. Given the substantial
   pedagogical and other professional benefits of intermural group
   meetings, we recommend this meeting format as a useful training tool for
   research trainees even after the current pandemic wanes.},

Abstract = {It is a long-standing hypothesis that the concise and customized
   notation of a DSL improves the performance of developers when compared
   with a GPL. For non-technical domains-e.g., science-, this hypothesis
   lacks empirical evidence. Given this lack of empirical evidence, we
   evaluate a DSL for ecological modeling designed and implemented by us
   with regard to performance improvements of developers as compared to a
   GPL. We conduct an online survey with embedded controlled experiments
   among ecologists to assess the correctness and time spent of the
   participants when using a DSL for ecosystem simulation specifications
   compared with a GPL-based solution. We observe that (1) solving tasks
   with the DSL, the participants' correctness point score was -depending
   on the task- on average 61 \% up to 63 \% higher than with the GPL-based
   solution and their average time spent per task was reduced by 31 \% up
   to 56 \%; (2) the participants subjectively find it easier to work with
   the DSL, and (3) more than 90 \% of the subjects are able to carry out
   basic maintenance tasks concerning the infrastructure of the DSL used in
   our treatment, which is based on another internal DSL embedded into
   Java. The tasks of our experiments are simplified and our web-based
   editor components do not offer full IDE-support. Our findings indicate
   that the development of further DSL for the specific needs of the
   ecological modeling community should be a worthwhile investment to
   increase its members' productivity and to enhance the reliability of
   their scientific results.},

Abstract = {The lifecycle of Web applications covers the design, implementation, and
   maintenance of the services. First generation Web development tools just
   concentrated on the creation of single pages. Later Web engineering
   tools have been integrating the management of complete Web sites and the
   navigation model. But only few attempt to cover all the aspects of the
   lifecycle, and especially the maintenance task which is essential on a
   dynamic medium as is the case on the Web. To increase the manageability
   and introduce flexibility to large Web services we introduce the JESSICA
   engineering system that employs an object-oriented abstraction model for
   the hypermedia information. An object-oriented language describes
   components of the Web service that are easy to manage, reusable, highly
   dynamic and of polymorphic type, covering all elements of a complete Web
   site. The objects are accessible throughout the lifecycle for management
   and maintenance activities. A compiler maps the abstract service
   description to the file-based repository of a standard Web server. We
   demonstrate the feasibility of the engineering system on managing the
   Vienna International Festival Web site, a multilingual database Web
   application on culture and arts, containing 300+ static pages and
   several interactive services. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science

   gap between simple, high-level programming models and complex, real
   execution environments like a cluster of workstations, and the
   unpredictability of program execution. The MILAN project addresses these
   problems and aims at increased Quality of Service (QoS) for parallel
   programs. This paper presents an overview of the current research
   results of MILAN. For clusters of workstations, the Calypso system
   provides a simple programming environment that: leverages theoretical
   results on fault-tolerant execution of parallel programs. A resource
   management system implements the necessary resource contracts for QoS,
   particularly for parallel applications. The concepts of Calypso have
   been applied to Web-based computing with the Charlotte system.},

Title = {Cloud computing based deduplication using high-performance grade byte
   check and fuzzy search technique},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT \& FUZZY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2},
Pages = {3411-3425},
Abstract = {Background: Data redundancy (DR) and data privacy (DP) is a critical
   issue that increases storage and security problems in cloud
   environments. Data de-duplication (DD) is one of the efficient backup
   storage techniques to reduce DR. The main problem with using cloud
   computing (CC) is more storage, the cost of deployment and maintenance.
   Objective: To minimize this problem, High-performance Grade Byte Check
   and Fuzzy search Techniques (HP-GBC-FST) based DD is proposed in this
   paper. Methods: The HP-GBC-FST is based on the pre-process of data by
   comparing their first byte and categorizing the byte based on the first
   byte. After DD, encryption has been processed on data to improve the
   data security in the cloud environment and then encrypted data is stored
   in the cloud. This HP-GBC-FST recognizes DR at the block level, reducing
   the redundancy of data more effectively. Then, HP-GBC-FST is created to
   detect and eliminate duplicates, improve security and storage efficiency
   (SE), reduce DD time and computation cost (CPC) in the DD verification
   and auditing phase. Result: The experiment has been conducted in an
   Intel I5 system and 500GB, 1Tb memory space and implemented in the Java
   programming environment. The results of the experiment reveal that the
   HP-GBC-FST improved the DD ratio and security by 3.7 and 97\%,
   respectively, and reduced the DD time and CPC by 87\% and 84.4\%,
   respectively, over the existing technique. Conclusion: It concluded that
   the HP-GBC-FST has greater improvement overDDdata in the cloud. Finally,
   the performance analysis of the HP-GBC-FST achieves higher storage, both
   privacy and security attributes, and incurs minimal CPC, DD time
   compared with the state he art research.},

Title = {A Delivery Robot Cloud Platform Based on Microservice},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {FEB 18},
Abstract = {Delivery robots face the problem of storage and computational stress
   when performing immediate tasks, exceeding the limits of on-board
   computing power. Based on cloud computing, robots can offload intensive
   tasks to the cloud and acquire massive data resources. With its
   distributed cluster architecture, the platform can help offload
   computing and improve the computing power of the control center, which
   can be considered the external ``brain{''} of the robot. Although it
   expands the capabilities of the robot, cloud service deployment remains
   complex because most current cloud robot applications are based on
   monolithic architectures. Some scholars have proposed developing robot
   applications through the microservice development paradigm, but there is
   currently no unified microservice-based robot cloud platform. This paper
   proposes a delivery robot cloud platform based on microservice,
   providing dedicated services for autonomous driving of delivery robot.
   The microservice architecture is adopted to split the monomer robot
   application into multiple services and then implement automatic
   orchestration and deployment of services on the cloud platform based on
   components such as Kubernetes, Docker, and Jenkins. This enables
   containerized CI/CD (continuous integration, continuous deployment, and
   continuous delivery) for the cloud platform service, and the whole
   process can be visualized, repeatable, and traceable. The platform is
   prebuilt with development tools, and robot application developers can
   use these tools to develop in the cloud, without the need for any
   customization in the background, to achieve the rapid deployment and
   launch of robot cloud service. Through the cloud migration of
   traditional robot applications and the development of new APPs, the
   platform service capabilities are continuously improved. This paper
   verifies the feasibility of the platform architecture through the
   delivery scene experiment.},

Abstract = {Parallel programming continues to be a challenging task despite the many
   advances in parallel architectures and their wide availability in the
   cloud. The need both to partition the workload among various processing
   elements and to specify communication between them to share code and
   data, and to coordinate their tasks, requires from the developer a deep
   understanding of the problem, the parallel architecture and the
   programming language used in order to develop efficient parallel
   applications. This problem can be reduced significantly through the use
   of visual programming languages to hide most aspects related to the
   specification of communication and processes management. This paper
   presents VPPE, a novel Visual Parallel Programming Environment that
   allows developers to program parallel applications through organising
   workflows of interconnected icons. VPPE is a cloud environment that
   supports icons for specifying: I/O operations, workflow organisation,
   communication, and processing. Processing computing patterns supported
   so far include Single Program Multiple Data, Multiple Program Multiple
   Data, Pipeline, and Master-Slave. The paper highlights the design of
   VPPE based on a context-free graph grammar, its current implementation
   based on Java-MPI, its use in developing various parallel applications,
   and its evaluation compared to Java-MPI text-based programming.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {JavaScript applications today are not limited to just client-side web
   applications and server-side code powered by Node.js. They became the
   standard for desktop application development with the emergence and
   popularity of the Electron framework. Combining the features of
   client-side and server-side applications, the Electron applications
   possess a completely different security posture. The attacks typical for
   front-end applications can now be escalated to the back-end attacks, for
   example, making a cross-site scripting result in a remote code execution
   on the user's machine. The goal of our study is to analyze the typical
   security vulnerabilities of an Electron application, study common
   mitigation controls, and propose new remediation solutions that are easy
   to implement for developers. In this study we analyze security
   vulnerabilities in over a hundred open source Electron applications
   using automated and manual static analysis. We explore the mitigation
   controls existing in the Electron framework, and propose changes to the
   framework that will prevent many of the common vulnerabilities. Based on
   these results, we develop an IDE plugin for Electron applications that
   automatically suggests remediations to common security defects within a
   developer's work environment, thus shifting the fixing of a
   vulnerability to earlier in the software development life cycle. We show
   the effectiveness of the IDE plugin by applying the plugin's suggestions
   to the analyzed open source applications and demonstrating that they
   stop being exploitable after the applied fix.},

   standards associated with Web Services and provides business example for
   illustration. Abstracting from this example, we introduce a concept we
   call Process Aggregation that incorporates data aggregation and workflow
   to improve productivity. We show that Web Services will have a major
   impact on Process Aggregation, making it both faster and less expensive
   to implement. Finally, we suggest some research directions relating to
   the Process Aggregation challenges facing Web Services that are not
   currently being addressed by standards bodies or software vendors. These
   include context mediation, trusted intermediaries, quality and source
   selection, licensing and payment mechanisms, and systems development

Abstract = {Many businesses are now moving towards the use of composite web
   services. These consist of a collection of web services working together
   to achieve an objective. Although they are becoming business-critical
   elements, current development tools do not provide a practical way to
   include fault tolerance characteristics in web services compositions.
   This paper proposes a mechanism that allows programmers to easily
   develop fault tolerant compositions using diverse services. The
   mechanism allows programmers to specify alternative web services for
   each operation and offers a set of artifacts that simplify the coding
   process, by automatically dealing with all aspects related to the
   redundant web services invocation and responses voting. The mechanism is
   also able to perform a continuous evaluation of the services based on
   their behavior during operation. The approach is illustrated using
   compositions based on services publicly available in the Internet anti
   on the services specified by the standard TPC-App performance benchmark.},

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Since the mid-2000s, the Argo oceanographic observational network has
   provided near-real-time four-dimensional data for the global ocean for
   the first time in history. Internet (i.e., the ``web{''}) applications
   that handle the more than two million Argo profiles of ocean
   temperature, salinity, and pressure are an active area of development.
   This paper introduces a new and efficient interactive Argo data
   visualization and delivery web application named Argovis that is built
   on a classic three-tier design consisting of a front end, back end, and
   database. Together these components allow users to navigate 4D data on a
   world map of Argo floats, with the option to select a custom region,
   depth range, and time period. Argovis's back end sends data to users in
   a simple format, and the front end quickly renders web-quality figures.
   More advanced applications query Argovis from other programming
   environments, such as Python, R, and MATLAB. Our Argovis architecture
   allows expert data users to build their own functionality for specific
   applications, such as the creation of spatially gridded data for a given
   time and advanced time-frequency analysis for a space-time selection.
   Argovis is aimed to both scientists and the public, with tutorials and
   examples available on the website, describing how to use the Argovis
   data delivery system-for example, how to plot profiles in a region over
   time or to monitor profile metadata.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the present work, we propose a generalization of the confidence
   polytopes approach for quantum state tomography (QST) to the case of
   quantum process tomography (QPT). Our approach allows obtaining a
   confidence region in the polytope form for a Choi matrix of an unknown
   quantum channel based on the measurement results of the corresponding
   QPT experiment. The method uses the improved version of the expression
   for confidence levels for the case of several positive operator-valued
   measures. We then demonstrate how confidence polytopes can be employed
   for calculating confidence intervals for affine functions of quantum
   states (Choi matrices), such as fidelities and observables mean values,
   which are used both in QST and QPT settings. As we propose, this problem
   can be efficiently solved using linear programming tools. We also study
   the performance and scalability of the developed approach on the basis
   of simulation and experimental data collected using IBM cloud quantum
   processor.},

Abstract = {Despite significant analytical improvements during this last decade,
   characterizing the whole integrity of monoclonal antibodies during their
   bioproduction remains a challenge. In this study, we report a new
   analytical approach to evaluate the overall heterogeneity/integrity of
   mAbs by LC-MS after combined proteolysis at their lower- and upper-hinge
   sites using the immunoglobulin-degrading enzymes IdeS and IgdE
   respectively. The whole sample preparation did not use any harsh
   conditions such as low pH, high temperature or reductive conditions and
   enables the splitting of mAbs structure into three fragments, namely the
   hinge dimer, Fab and Fc/2. Using the NIST mAb reference material, this
   method was demonstrated to be particularly suited for the analysis of
   mAbs disulfide bridges. The three fragments as well as their
   corresponding free sulfhydryl forms were well separated by
   chromatography and identified online by mass spectrometry. The method
   was then successfully applied to several mAbs of variable
   hydrophobicities. (C) 2017 LFB BIOTECHNOLOGIES. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Using Semantic Web technologies in complex scenarios requires that such
   technologies correctly interoperate by interchanging ontologies using

   affordable mechanisms for evaluating Semantic Web technology
   interoperability are needed to comprehend the current and future

   interoperability of different Semantic Web technologies using OWL as the
   interchange language. It describes the evaluation resources used in this
   benchmarking activity, the OWL Lite Import Benchmark Suite and the IBSE

Abstract = {The rise of the Internet of Things has generated high expectations about
   the improvement in people's lifestyles. In the last decade, we saw
   several examples of instrumented cities where different types of data
   were gathered, processed, and made available to inspire the next
   generation of scientists and engineers. In this framework, sensors and
   actuators became leading actors of technologically pervasive urban
   environments. However, in coastal areas, marine data crowdsourcing is
   difficult to apply due to the challenging operational conditions,
   extremely unstable network connectivity, and security issues in data
   movement. To fill this gap, we present a novel version of our DYNAMO
   transfer protocol (DTP), a platform-independent data mover framework
   where data collected on board of vessels are stored locally and then
   moved from the edge to the cloud when the operating conditions are
   favorable. We evaluate the performance of DTP in a controlled
   environment with a private cloud by measuring the time it takes for the
   clouds ide to process and store a fixed amount of data while varying the
   number of microservice instances. We show that the time decreases
   exponentially when the number of microservice instances goes from 1 to
   16 and it remains constant above that number.},

Abstract = {Profiling of proteome dynamics is crucial for understanding cellular
   behavior in response to intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli and maintenance
   of homeostasis. Over the last 20 years, mass spectrometry (MS) has
   emerged as the most powerful tool for large-scale identification and
   characterization of proteins. Bottom-up proteomics, the most common
   MS-based proteomics approach, has always been challenging in terms of
   data management, processing, analysis and visualization, with modern
   instruments capable of producing several gigabytes of data out of a
   single experiment. Here, we present ProteoSign, a freely available web
   application, dedicated in allowing users to perform proteomics
   differential expression/abundance analysis in a userfriendly and
   self-explanatory way. Although several non-commercial standalone tools
   have been developed for post-quantification statistical analysis of
   proteomics data, most of them are not end-user appealing as they often
   require very stringent installation of programming environments,
   third-party software packages and sometimes further scripting or
   computer programming. To avoid this bottleneck, we have developed a
   user-friendly software platform accessible via a web interface in order
   to enable proteomics laboratories and core facilities to statistically
   analyse quantitative proteomics data sets in a resource-efficient
   manner. ProteoSign is available at
   http://bioinformatics.med.uoc.gr/ProteoSign and the source code at

Abstract = {The increasing development of algorithms for the assessment of
   structural modal characteristics stems from continuous improvement in
   vibration tests and computational processing capabilities. However, the
   identification process of deformable dynamic systems occasionally
   demands high computational costs. Nevertheless, with the increasing
   expansion of high-speed broadband internet, the concept of web
   application becomes a prevailing alternative. This paper presents the
   free web application Midas (Modal Identification of Deformable Systems),
   which is implemented in Java and applied to structural modal
   identification. This procedure is performed via the internet using data
   gathered from dynamic measurements. Available technologies and web
   development tools such as JavaServer Pages and JavaServer Faces are used
   to implement Midas. For the dynamic treatment of the vibration data, two
   identification techniques are used - the random decrement method and the
   Ibrahim time domain method. In order to evaluate the developed web
   application, two experimental applications are explored.},

Abstract = {Crawlers, also called robots and spiders, are programs that browse the
   World Wide Web autonomously. This paper describes SPHINX, a Java toolkit
   and interactive development environment for Web crawlers. Unlike other
   crawler development systems, SPHINX is geared towards developing
   crawlers that are Web-site-specific, personally customized, and
   relocatable. SPHINX allows site-specific crawling rules to be
   encapsulated and reused in content analyzers, known as classifiers.
   Personal crawling tasks can be performed (often without programming) in
   the Crawler Workbench, an interactive environment for crawler
   development and testing. For efficiency, relocatable crawlers developed
   using SPHINX can be uploaded and executed on a remote Web server. (C)

Abstract = {We have developed a specialized database, HBVdb (http://hbvdb.ibcp.fr),
   allowing the researchers to investigate the genetic variability of
   Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and viral resistance to treatment. HBV is a
   major health problem worldwide with more than 350 million individuals
   being chronically infected. HBV is an enveloped DNA virus that
   replicates by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate. HBV genome
   is optimized, being circular and encoding four overlapping reading
   frames. Indeed, each nucleotide of the genome takes part in the coding
   of at least one protein. However, HBV shows some genome variability
   leading to at least eight different genotypes and recombinant forms. The
   main drugs used to treat infected patients are nucleos(t)ides analogs
   (reverse transcriptase inhibitors). Unfortunately, HBV mutants resistant
   to these drugs may be selected and be responsible for treatment failure.
   HBVdb contains a collection of computer-annotated sequences based on
   manually annotated reference genomes. The database can be accessed
   through a web interface that allows static and dynamic queries and
   offers integrated generic sequence analysis tools and specialized
   analysis tools (e.g. annotation, genotyping, drug resistance profiling).},

   scenarios in the application development environment, we propose a
   multi-task PaaS cloud infrastructure using Docker and AWS services for
   application isolation, optimization and rapid deployment of distributed
   applications. We fully utilized Docker, a lightweight containerization
   technology that uses a host of the Linux kernel's features such as
   namespaces and cgroup's to sandbox processes into configurable virtual
   environments. The Amazon EC2 container service helps our container
   management framework. The cluster management framework uses optimistic,
   shared state scheduling to execute processes on EC2 instances using
   Docker containers. Several experimentations were carried out, one of the
   experimentation focused on a simulation of application deployment
   scheduling that shows our propose infrastructure is flexible, efficient
   and well optimized.},

   at multiple institutions. In the process, the environment has undergone
   many refinements to meet demands for improved functionality and to
   leverage rapidly changing underlying technology for the improvements.
   The environment is tailored to present formal specifications and
   alternative implementations of components, and enable correctness
   checking through a server-side verifying compiler. This paper presents a
   detailed account of the development and evolution of the environmentits

   evaluations took a summative approach and relied on self-report surveys
   to evaluate cognitive learning outcomes related to machine learning (ML)
   concepts among middle and high school students in informal settings. The
   tools commonly employed for evaluation were AI-based programming tools
   and online platforms. These findings offer valuable insights for AI
   educators and researchers in K-12 education, highlighting the
   significance of introducing students to the assessment of AI in formal

Abstract = {The rising popularity of social media has created valuable opportunities
   for researchers to quickly and cheaply tap large amounts of data on
   naturalistic social interactions. One of the most useful and accessible
   sources of social media data is Twitter. Although Twitter data are free
   to access, however, the programming tools required to collect and
   analyze these data are likely to create a barrier for many
   psychologists. The goal of this article is to reduce that barrier by
   explaining what data are available from Twitter and providing code and
   step-by-step instructions to retrieve them. I also review approaches to
   deriving psychological insight from these data, the accompanying
   challenges, and potential solutions, providing code to make these tasks
   easier. Particularly for researchers without access to large participant
   pools, overseas collaborators, or online panels, Twitter can be an
   important source of psychological insight.},

Abstract = {Leveraging previously untapped data sources offers significant potential
   for value creation in the manufacturing sector. However, asset-heavy
   shop floors, extended machine replacement cycles, and equipment
   diversity necessitate considerable investments for achieving smart
   manufacturing, which can be particularly challenging for small
   businesses. Retrofitting presents a viable solution, enabling the
   integration of low-cost sensors and microcontrollers with older machines
   to collect and transmit data. In this paper, we introduce a concept and
   a prototype for retrofitting industrial environments using lightweight
   web technologies at the edge. Our approach employs WebAssembly as a
   novel bytecode standard, facilitating a consistent development
   environment from the cloud to the edge by operating on both browsers and
   bare-metal hardware. By attaining near-native performance and modularity
   reminiscent of container-based service architectures, we demonstrate the
   feasibility of our approach. Our prototype was evaluated with an actual
   industrial robot within a showcase factory, including measurements of
   data exchange with a cutting-edge data lake system. We further extended
   the prototype to incorporate a peer-to-peer network that facilitates
   message routing and WebAssembly software updates. Our technology
   establishes a foundational framework for the transition towards Industry
   4.0. By integrating considerations of sustainability and human factors,
   it further extends this groundwork to facilitate progression into
   Industry 5.0.},

Title = {Identifying Classes in Legacy JavaScript Code},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE-EVOLUTION AND PROCESS},
Year = {2017},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {JavaScript is the most popular programming language for the Web.
   Although the language is prototype-based, developers can emulate
   class-based abstractions in JavaScript to master the increasing
   complexity of their applications. Identifying classes in legacy
   JavaScript code can support these developers at least in the following
   activities: (1) program comprehension; (2) migration to the new
   JavaScript syntax that supports classes; and (3) implementation of
   supporting tools, including IDEs with class-based views and reverse
   engineering tools. In this paper, we propose a strategy to detect
   class-based abstractions in the source code of legacy JavaScript
   systems. We report on a large and in-depth study to understand how class
   emulation is employed, using a dataset of 918 JavaScript applications
   available on GitHub. We found that almost 70\% of the JavaScript systems
   we study make some usage of classes. We also performed a field study
   with the main developers of 60 popular JavaScript systems to validate
   our findings. The overall results range from 97\% to 100\% for
   precision, from 70\% to 89\% for recall, and from 82\% to 94\% for

Title = {A RESTful API for Accessing Microbial Community Data for MG-RAST},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Metagenomic sequencing has produced significant amounts of data in
   recent years. For example, as of summer 2013, MG-RAST has been used to
   annotate over 110,000 data sets totaling over 43 Terabases. With
   metagenomic sequencing finding even wider adoption in the scientific
   community, the existing web-based analysis tools and infrastructure in
   MG-RAST provide limited capability for data retrieval and analysis, such
   as comparative analysis between multiple data sets. Moreover, although
   the system provides many analysis tools, it is not comprehensive. By
   opening MG-RAST up via a web services API (application programmers
   interface) we have greatly expanded access to MG-RAST data, as well as
   provided a mechanism for the use of third-party analysis tools with
   MG-RAST data. This RESTful API makes all data and data objects created
   by the MG-RAST pipeline accessible as JSON objects. As part of the DOE
   Systems Biology Knowledgebase project (KBase, http://kbase.us) we have
   implemented a web services API for MG-RAST. This API complements the
   existing MG-RAST web interface and constitutes the basis of KBase's
   microbial community capabilities. In addition, the API exposes a
   comprehensive collection of data to programmers. This API, which uses a
   RESTful (Representational State Transfer) implementation, is compatible
   with most programming environments and should be easy to use for end
   users and third parties. It provides comprehensive access to sequence
   data, quality control results, annotations, and many other data types.
   Where feasible, we have used standards to expose data and metadata. Code
   examples are provided in a number of languages both to show the
   versatility of the API and to provide a starting point for users. We
   present an API that exposes the data in MG-RAST for consumption by our
   users, greatly enhancing the utility of the MG-RAST service.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Collect Earth is a free and open source software for land monitoring
   developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
   (FAO). Built on Google desktop and cloud computing technologies, Collect
   Earth facilitates access to multiple freely available archives of
   satellite imagery, including archives with very high spatial resolution
   imagery (Google Earth, Bing Maps) and those with very high temporal
   resolution imagery (e.g., Google Earth Engine, Google Earth Engine Code
   Editor). Collectively, these archives offer free access to an
   unparalleled amount of information on current and past land dynamics for
   any location in the world. Collect Earth draws upon these archives and
   the synergies of imagery of multiple resolutions to enable an innovative
   method for land monitoring that we present here: augmented visual
   interpretation. In this study, we provide a full overview of Collect
   Earth's structure and functionality, and we present the methodology used
   to undertake land monitoring through augmented visual interpretation. To
   illustrate the application of the tool and its customization potential,
   an example of land monitoring in Papua New Guinea (PNG) is presented.
   The PNG example demonstrates that Collect Earth is a comprehensive and
   user-friendly tool for land monitoring and that it has the potential to
   be used to assess land use, land use change, natural disasters,
   sustainable management of scarce resources and ecosystem functioning. By
   enabling non-remote sensing experts to assess more than 100 sites per
   day, we believe that Collect Earth can be used to rapidly and
   sustainably build capacity for land monitoring and to substantively
   improve our collective understanding of the world's land use and land
   cover.},

Abstract = {This article proposes an efficient quantum train engine (EQuaTE), a
   novel development tool for quantum neural network (QNN) autonomous
   driving software, which plots gradient variances to confirm whether the
   QNN falls into local minima situations (called barren plateaus). Based
   on this runtime visualization, the stability and feasibility of
   QNN-based software can be tested during runtime operations of autonomous
   driving functionalities. This software testing of a QNN via dynamic
   analysis is essentially required due to undetermined probabilistic qubit
   states during runtime operations. Furthermore, an EQuaTE is capable of
   visual feedback because the barren plateaus can be identified at local
   autonomous driving platforms, and the corresponding information will be
   visualized at remotely connected cloud. Based on this visualized
   information at the cloud, the QNN, which is also stored at cloud, should
   be automatically reorganized and retrained for eliminating barren
   plateaus. Then, the trained parameters can be downloaded into the QNN of
   autonomous driving platforms.},

   entrepreneurial self-development. Analysis of business students'
   changing priorities in finding and using online social networks during
   the years 2008-2019 demonstrated the dominance of Facebook and, more
   recently, Instagram, compared to LinkedIn and more specialized networks
   for entrepreneurs. Students involved in knowledge sharing for
   travelling, sports, music and online gaming have a more detailed
   understanding of online social media as entrepreneurial self-development
   tools. Recent years demonstrated some desire to integrate online
   communication and joint actions in physical locations. Students need a
   deeper understanding of how their online communication and networking
   priorities can be aligned with their entrepreneurial network development
   and knowledge sharing priorities through social media. Our longitudinal
   research of student priorities in online social network use demonstrates
   to educators the importance of understanding the self-development paths
   of students when improving their skills to use online networking. Higher
   education should guide students to use online media to trace new

Journal = {EXPERIMENTAL ASTRONOMY},

Pages = {139-164},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Data from the Herschel Space Observatory is freely available to the
   public but no uniformly processed catalogue of the observations has been
   published so far. To date, the Herschel Science Archive does not contain
   the exact sky coverage (footprint) of individual observations and
   supports search for measurements based on bounding circles only. Drawing
   on previous experience in implementing footprint databases, we built the
   Herschel Footprint Database and Web Services for the Herschel Space
   Observatory to provide efficient search capabilities for typical
   astronomical queries. The database was designed with the following main
   goals in mind: (a) provide a unified data model for meta-data of all
   instruments and observational modes, (b) quickly find observations
   covering a selected object and its neighbourhood, (c) quickly find every
   observation in a larger area of the sky, (d) allow for finding solar
   system objects crossing observation fields. As a first step, we
   developed a unified data model of observations of all three Herschel
   instruments for all pointing and instrument modes. Then, using telescope
   pointing information and observational meta-data, we compiled a database
   of footprints. As opposed to methods using pixellation of the sphere, we
   represent sky coverage in an exact geometric form allowing for precise
   area calculations. For easier handling of Herschel observation
   footprints with rather complex shapes, two algorithms were implemented
   to reduce the outline. Furthermore, a new visualisation tool to plot
   footprints with various spherical projections was developed. Indexing of
   the footprints using Hierarchical Triangular Mesh makes it possible to
   quickly find observations based on sky coverage, time and meta-data. The
   database is accessible via a web site http://herschel.vo.elte.hu and
   also as a set of REST web service functions, which makes it readily
   usable from programming environments such as Python or IDL. The web
   service allows downloading footprint data in various formats including
   Virtual Observatory standards.},

Title = {Adverse Events Following Cervical Disc Arthroplasty: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {GLOBAL SPINE JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {178-189},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Study Design: Systematic review.
   Objectives: Cervical arthroplasty is an increasingly popular treatment
   of cervical radiculopathy and myelopathy. An understanding of the
   potential adverse events (AEs) is important to help both clinicians and
   patients. We sought to provide a comprehensive systematic review of the
   AEs reported in all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of cervical disc
   arthroplasty in an attempt to characterize the quality of reporting.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review of MEDLINE and Web of Science
   for RCTs of cervical disc arthroplasty reporting AEs. We reported the
   most frequently mentioned AEs, including dysphagia/dysphonia, vascular
   compromise, dural injury, and infections. We recorded the presence of
   industry funding and scored the quality of collection methods and
   reporting of AEs.
   Results: Of the 3734 identified articles, 29 articles met full inclusion
   criteria. The quality of AE reporting varied significantly between
   studies, and a combined meta-analysis was not feasible. The 29 articles
   covered separate 19 RCTs. Eight studies were US Food and Drug
   Administration (FDA) investigational device exemption (IDE) trials.
   Rates were recorded for the following AEs: dysphagia/dysphonia (range =
   1.3\% to 27.2\%), vascular compromise (range = 1.1\% to 2.4\%), cervical
   wound infection (range = 1.2\% to 22.5\%), and cerebrospinal fluid leak
   (range = 0.8\% to 7.1\%).
   Conclusions: There is a lack of consistency in reporting of AEs among
   RCTs of cervical arthroplasty. FDA IDE trials scored better in AE event
   reporting compared to other studies. Standardized definitions for AEs
   and standardized data collection methodology are needed to improve
   future studies.},

Title = {An Innovative Cloud-Fog-Based Smart Grid Scheme for Efficient Resource
   Utilization},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Smart grids (SGs) enhance the effectiveness, reliability, resilience,
   and energy-efficient operation of electrical networks. Nonetheless, SGs
   suffer from big data transactions which limit their capabilities and can
   cause delays in the optimal operation and management tasks. Therefore,
   it is clear that a fast and reliable architecture is needed to make big
   data management in SGs more efficient. This paper assesses the optimal
   operation of the SGs using cloud computing (CC), fog computing, and
   resource allocation to enhance the management problem. Technically, big
   data management makes SG more efficient if cloud and fog computing (CFC)
   are integrated. The integration of fog computing (FC) with CC minimizes
   cloud burden and maximizes resource allocation. There are three key
   features for the proposed fog layer: awareness of position, short
   latency, and mobility. Moreover, a CFC-driven framework is proposed to
   manage data among different agents. In order to make the system more
   efficient, FC allocates virtual machines (VMs) according to
   load-balancing techniques. In addition, the present study proposes a
   hybrid gray wolf differential evolution optimization algorithm (HGWDE)
   that brings gray wolf optimization (GWO) and improved differential
   evolution (IDE) together. Simulation results conducted in MATLAB verify
   the efficiency of the suggested algorithm according to the high data
   transaction and computational time. According to the results, the
   response time of HGWDE is 54 ms, 82.1 ms, and 81.6 ms faster than
   particle swarm optimization (PSO), differential evolution (DE), and GWO.
   HGWDE's processing time is 53 ms, 81.2 ms, and 80.6 ms faster than PSO,
   DE, and GWO. Although GWO is a bit more efficient than HGWDE, the
   difference is not very significant.},

Abstract = {It has been reported that treatment with telbivudine might be associated

Journal = {COMPUTER JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {55},
Number = {1},
Pages = {82-98},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Novel data-mining tasks in e-science involve mining of distributed,
   highly heterogeneous data and knowledge sources. However, standard data
   mining platforms, such as Weka and Orange, involve only their own data
   mining algorithms in the process of knowledge discovery from local data
   sources. In contrast, next generation data mining technologies should
   enable processing of distributed data sources, the use of data mining
   algorithms implemented as web services, as well as the use of formal
   descriptions of data sources and knowledge discovery tools in the form
   of ontologies, enabling automated composition of complex knowledge
   discovery workflows for a given data mining task. This paper proposes a
   novel Service-oriented Knowledge Discovery framework and its
   implementation in a service-oriented data mining environment Orange4WS
   (Orange for Web Services), based on the existing Orange data mining
   toolbox and its visual programming environment, which enables manual
   composition of data mining workflows. The new service-oriented data
   mining environment Orange4WS includes the following new features: simple
   use of web services as remote components that can be included into a
   data mining workflow; simple incorporation of relational data mining
   algorithms; a knowledge discovery ontology to describe workflow
   components (data, knowledge and data mining services) in an abstract and
   machine-interpretable way, and its use by a planner that enables
   automated composition of data mining workflows. These new features are
   showcased in three real-world scenarios.},

Title = {Design and Assessment of a Mobile Health Care Solution for the Military
   Pediatrician: The DHA Pediatrics App},
Journal = {MILITARY MEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {187},

Pages = {232-241},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {Introduction:
   Mobile health technology design and use by patients and clinicians have
   rapidly evolved in the past 20 years. Nevertheless, the technology has
   remained in silos of practices, patients, and individual institutions.
   Uptake across integrated health systems has lagged.
   Materials and Methods:
   In 2015, the authors designed a mobile health application (App) aimed at
   augmenting the capabilities of clinicians who care for children within
   the Military Health System (MHS). This App incorporated a curated,
   system-based collection of Clinical Practice Guidelines, access to
   emergency resuscitation cards, call buttons for local market
   subspecialty and inpatient teams, links to residency academic calendars,
   and other web-based resources. Over the next 5 years, three
   PlanDo-Study-Act cycles facilitated multiple enhancements for the App
   which eventually transitioned from the Android/iOS stores to a web
   browser. The ``People At the Centre of Mobile Application
   Development{''} tool which has validity evidence captured user
   experience. The team assessed the App's global effectiveness using
   Google Analytics. A speed test measured time saved and accuracy of task
   completion for clinicians using the App compared to non-users. Finally,
   MHS medical librarians critiqued the App using a questionnaire with
   validity evidence. The Walter Reed National Military Medical Center
   Institutional Review Board reviewed the study and deemed it exempt.
   Results:
   Clinician respondents (n= 68 complete responses across six MTFs, 51\%
   graduate medical trainees representing a 7.4\% response rate of active
   duty pediatrician forces) perceived the App to have appropriate
   qualities of efficiency, effectiveness, learnability, memorability,
   errors, satisfaction, and cognitive properties following App use in
   clinical practice. Google Analytics demonstrated more than 1,000 unique
   users on the App from May 1, 2020 to January 20, 2021. There were 746
   instances (26\% of all sessions) when a user navigated between more than
   one military treatment facility. App users were faster and more accurate
   at task completion during a digital scavenger hunt. Medical librarians
   measured the App to have acceptable usefulness, accuracy, authority,
   objectivity, timeliness, functionality, design, security, and value.
   Conclusions:
   The App appears to be an effective tool to extend a clinician's
   capabilities and inter-professional communication between world-wide
   users and six MHS markets. This App was designed-and used-for a large
   health care network across a wide geographic footprint. Next steps are
   establishing an enduring chain of App champions for continued updates
   and sharing the App's code with other military medical disciplines and
   interested civilian centers.},

Abstract = {Introduction The Woven EndoBridge (WEB) represents a novel intrasaccular
   therapeutic option for the treatment of intracranial wide-necked
   bifurcation aneurysms (WNBAs). The WEB-IT Study is a pivotal
   Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study to determine the safety and
   effectiveness of the WEB device for the treatment of WNBAs located in
   the anterior and posterior intracranial circulations. We present the
   patient demographics, procedural characteristics, and 30-day adverse
   event data for the US WEB-IT study. Methods WEB-IT is a prospective
   multicenter single-arm interventional study conducted at 25 US and 6
   international centers. The study enrolled 150 adults with WNBAs of the
   anterior and posterior intracranial circulations. All patients were
   intended to receive a WEB device delivered via standard endovascular
   neurosurgical embolization techniques. The study was conducted under
   Good Clinical Practices and included independent adjudication
   effectiveness outcomes and all adverse events. Results One hundred and
   fifty patients enrolled at 27 investigational sites underwent attempted
   treatment with the WEB. Mean age was 59 years (range 29-79) and 110
   (73.3\%) of the patients were female. Treated aneurysms were located at
   the basilar apex (n=59, 39.3\%), middle cerebral artery bifurcation
   (n=45, 30\%), anterior communicating artery (n=40, 26.7\%), and internal
   carotid artery terminus (n=6, 4\%). Average aneurysm size was 6.4 mm
   (range 3.6-11.4) with a mean neck size of 4.8 mm (range 2.0-8.2, mean
   dome to neck ratio 1.34). Nine patients presented with ruptured
   aneurysms. Of the enrolled patients, 98.7\% were treated successfully
   with WEB devices. Mean +/- SD fluoroscopy time was 30.2 +/- 15.7 min.
   One primary safety event (PSE) (0.7\%)-a delayed parenchymal hemorrhage
   22 days after treatment-occurred between the index procedure and 30-day
   follow-up. In addition to the single PSE, there were seven (4.7\%) minor
   ischemic strokes (5 resolved without sequelae and 2 had a modified
   Rankin Scale score of 1 at 30 days), five (2.7\%) transient ischemic
   attacks, and two (1.3\%) minor subarachnoid hemorrhages, which did not
   meet the prospectively established criteria for PSEs. Conclusions The
   WEB device can be used to treat WNBAs with a high level of procedural
   safety and a high degree of technical success.},

Abstract = {Robot manipulators are described geometrically by their
   Denavit-Hartenberg parameters table. This article describes a package
   that combines recently developed internet-based programming tools to
   generate three-dimensional virtual models of robot manipulators from a
   DH parameter table. Robot-Draw combines hypertext markup language
   (HTML), practical extraction and report language (PERL), and virtual
   reality modeling language (VRML), Internet users can generate
   three-dimensional robot manipulator models on their computer screens,
   navigate around the robot model and examine it from any angle. The
   package was designed as a visualization aid in robotics education and
   allows educators and students to easily visualize robotic structures and
   directly evaluate the effect of a parameter variation on the overall
   robot. Robot-Draw can also be a useful tool in the structural design of
   robot manipulators. Users with Internet connections can use the
   University of West Florida Robot-Draw package at the UWF Electrical
   Engineering web server by connecting to

Abstract = {Air pollution is caused by chemical, physical, or biological components
   alters the fundamental properties of the atmosphere, and contaminates
   the interior or outdoor settings. With the rapid industrialization
   activity in recent years, there is an urgent need to monitor air
   quality. The proposed research provides a mechanism for monitoring air
   pollution in indoor and outdoor environments. The system consists of an
   IoT-based Arduino device. The Arduino IDE connects the Temperature and
   Humidity sensor, Grove light sensor, and air quality sensor to measure
   the air pollutants such as Carbon dioxide CO2, Nitrogen oxide (NOx), and
   Particulate Matter PM2.5. The sensors work efficiently and provide
   qualitative findings from the environment when they are exposed to CO2,
   gasoline, solvents, thinner, formaldehyde, and other harmful chemicals.
   The Wi-Fi module of the Blues Wireless Notehub is used for secure data
   routing to the IoT cloud. The Air Quality Index (AQI) measures provide
   information on whether there is something unsafe in indoor and outdoor
   environments. For collecting and analyzing the device data, the Notecard
   is intended to be used with a cloud storage service. Also, the indoor
   fire detector identifies the incident of fire intimates the users
   through the alarm, and measures the indoor pollutant at that time. The
   proposed smart IoT product model would be an excellent device for air
   quality monitoring because of its long-term consistency and low
   electricity consumption.},

Abstract = {As an increasingly large number of OWL ontologies become available on
   the Semantic Web and the descriptions in the ontologies become more
   complicated, finding the cause of errors becomes an extremely hard task
   even for experts. Existing ontology development environments provide
   some limited support, in conjunction with a reasoner, for reporting
   errors in OWL ontologies. Typically, these are restricted to the mere
   detection of, for example, unsatisfiable concepts. However, the
   diagnosis and resolution of the bug is not supported at all. For
   example, no explanation is given as to why the error occurs (e. g., by
   pinpointing the root clash, or axioms in the ontology responsible for
   the clash) or how dependencies between classes cause the error to
   propagate (i.e., by distinguishing root from derived unsatisfiable
   classes). In the former case, information from the internals of a
   description logic tableaux reasoner can be extracted and presented to
   the user (glass box approach); while in the latter case, the reasoner
   can be used as an oracle for a certain set of questions and the asserted
   structure of the ontology can be used to help isolate the source of the
   problems (black box approach). Based on the two approaches, we have
   integrated a number of debugging cues generated from our reasoner,
   Pellet, in our hypertextual ontology development environment, Swoop. A
   conducted usability evaluation demonstrates that these debugging cues
   significantly improve the OWL debugging experience, and point the way to
   more general improvements in the presentation of an ontology to users.

Note = {61st ASIS Annual Meeting, PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, OCT 24-29, 1998},
Abstract = {As the number of participants and the level of standardization in the
   global information economy increase, it becomes more feasible to provide
   search tools that cater to segments of the user community who are
   outside the main stream. This paper describes a prototype for a shelf
   browsing search system that can be tailored to meet the needs of such
   marginalized user groups. Tn this approach, terms in an online thesaurus
   are linked to relevant classification numbers. A user can search the
   thesaurus, identify appropriate classification numbers, and use them as
   starting points in browsing the shelf lists of online catalogues. A
   variety of thesauri can be used to provide vocabularies appropriate to
   particular user populations. The classification systems inevitably
   impose biases and limitations, but these can be partially alleviated by
   supplying information regarding the goodness of the fit between a term
   and the linked classification number.
   In our prototype we have built links between a widely used feminist
   vocabulary, A Women's Thesaurus, and the Dewey Decimal Classification.
   The enhanced thesaurus is constructed and maintained in a commercial
   thesaurus package and then exported to a relational database for
   searching. A hypertextual interface has been developed to search the
   database on a workstation, and a second interface has been built to
   permit searching through the World Wide Web. The aim is to provide a
   model for implementations that use minimal resources and are widely
   applicable, so we have worked in the Windows environment with
   inexpensive development tools like Visual Basic and Microsoft Access.
   The prototype has demonstrated that even such simple tools can provide
   an effective user interface and satisfactory performance.},

Abstract = {Code Bubbles is an attempt to redefine the user interface for an
   integrated programming environment. As it represents a whole new user
   interface, implementing it as a plug-in is inherently difficult. We get
   around this difficulty by combining two different plug-in architectures,
   a standard one based on registrations and callbacks and a message-based
   one that puts the plug-in at arm's length and defines a narrower two-way
   interface. This paper describes both how we have implemented Code
   Bubbles as a plug-in to Eclipse and how Code Bubbles itself is
   implemented as a set of plug-ins representing the different aspects of
   the environment, using both traditional and message-based plug-in
   architectures as appropriate. It also shows how the resultant
   architecture is flexible enough to support collaboration, different back
   ends, and a cloud-based environment. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \&

Title = {Programming cobots by voice: a pragmatic, web-based approach},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 28},
Abstract = {This paper introduces a novel voice-based programming approach and
   software framework for collaborative robots (cobots) based on the Web
   Speech API, which is now supported by most modern browsers. The
   framework targets human programmable interfaces and human-machine
   interfaces, which can be used by people with little or no programming
   experience. The framework follows a meta-programming approach by
   enabling users to program cobots by voice in addition to using a mouse,
   tablet, or keyboard. Upon a voice instruction, the framework automates
   the manual tasks required to manipulate the vendor-provided interfaces.
   The main advantages of this approach are simplified, guided programming,
   which only requires the knowledge of 5-10 voice instructions; increased
   programming speed compared to the manual approach; and the possibility
   of sharing programs as videos. The approach is generalized to other
   kinds of robots and robot programming tools using so-called
   meta-controllers, which leverage the power of graphical user interface
   automation tools and techniques.},

Abstract = {Web services have recently emerged as a powerful technology for
   integrating heterogeneous, applications over the Internet. The
   widespread adoption of Web services promises to usher in an exciting new
   generation of advanced distributed applications. These will support a
   new and growing set of specifications, such as Simple Object Access
   Protocol (SOAP), Web Services Description Language (WSDL), and Universal
   Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI). Extensible Markup
   Language (XML) and its associated, family of standards also play a
   central role in Web services by providing a data interchange, format
   that is independent of both programming , languages and operating
   systems. The application developer seeking to reap the benefits of Web
   services is therefore faced with a significant, and potentially steep,
   new learning curve. Clearly, application development tools that lower
   this barrier are crucial for the rapid and widespread adoption, of Web
   services. This paper discusses the development tasks associated with XML
   Web services and describes a new suite of tools that improve developer
   productivity, by reducing the, requirements for detailed:
   knowledge-of-the, underlying specifications and standards, and allow the
   developer to,focus on the business. problem domain. This suite of XML
   and Web services tools is part of IBM's recently released,
   WebSphere((R)) Studio Application Developer product, which is based on

Abstract = {There is a notable overlap of the challenges with which the semantic
   technologies and software engineering deal. They can also complement and
   mutually improve each other. Current efforts mostly focus on improving
   software tools around the resource description framework (RDF) and Web
   Ontology Language (OWL) Web-oriented ecosystem that helps ontology
   engineers but is alien to software engineers. This paper presents an
   opposite approach taken from the software developer's viewpoint-an
   incorporation of the ontology paradigm into a general-purpose
   programming language, in a simple and agile way, on a small scale, and
   in an unpretentious manner. The objective is to help programmers write
   simple domain-driven code with richer semantics. The means to achieve
   this objective relies on metaprogramming to internalize the ontology
   modeling paradigm into a mainstream programming environment based on the
   Java ecosystem, in a lightweight manner suitable for small teams. An
   embedded meta domain-specific language (DSL), which is called Magic
   Potion, is implemented in Clojure and blends ontology, functional,
   object-oriented, and concurrent paradigms. An example from the
   technology enhanced learning (TEL) domain is used to illustrate Magic
   Potion in action.},

Abstract = {Existing software development environments for discrete-event simulation
   have adopted either a language-based or a library-based approach.
   Although these approaches have advantages, they suffer from three
   Limitations: lack of portability, lack of interoperability, and
   difficulty in execution over the Internet/Web infrastructure. The paper
   addresses these Limitations by proposing to facilitate discrete-event
   simulation as a service on the Internet/Web. The simulation service is
   defined as a CORBA facility with a well-defined interface, and
   components of simulation applications access the facility to obtain
   execution support. The simulation facility enables portability and
   interoperability of simulation applications which may be developed in
   heterogeneous languages and environments and communicate over the
   Internet. Moreover, by integrating with Java, the approach also enables
   simulation applications to be developed in Java and executed on the Web.
   Application of the simulation facility is illustrated by using a
   bounded-buffer producer/consumer system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {Online adaptive radiation therapy (ART) promises the ability to deliver
   an optimal treatment in response to daily patient anatomic variation. A
   major technical barrier for the clinical implementation of online ART is
   the requirement of rapid image segmentation. Deformable image
   registration (DIR) has been used as an automated segmentation method to
   transfer tumor/organ contours from the planning image to daily images.
   However, the current computational time of DIR is insufficient for
   online ART. In this work, this issue is addressed by using computer
   graphics processing units (GPUs). A gray-scale-based DIR algorithm
   called demons and five of its variants were implemented on GPUs using
   the compute unified device architecture (CUDA) programming environment.
   The spatial accuracy of these algorithms was evaluated over five sets of
   pulmonary 4D CT images with an average size of 256 x 256 x 100 and more
   than 1100 expert-determined landmark point pairs each. For all the
   testing scenarios presented in this paper, the GPU-based DIR computation
   required around 7 to 11 s to yield an average 3D error ranging from 1.5
   to 1.8 mm. It is interesting to find out that the original passive force
   demons algorithms outperform subsequently proposed variants based on the
   combination of accuracy, efficiency and ease of implementation.},

   biodata retrieval system, able to interface with different data formats,
   as well as provides an integrated way for data exploration. The proposed
   framework was implemented using Java as the development environment, and
   MongoDB as the database manager. Syntactic analysis was based on BSON,

Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Cellular response to stimuli is typically complex and involves both
   regulatory and metabolic processes. Large-scale experimental efforts to
   identify components of these processes often comprise of genetic
   screening and transcriptomic profiling assays. We previously established
   that in yeast genetic screens tend to identify response regulators,
   while transcriptomic profiling assays tend to identify components of
   metabolic processes. ResponseNet is a network-optimization approach that
   integrates the results from these assays with data of known molecular
   interactions. Specifically, ResponseNet identifies a high-probability
   sub-network, composed of signaling and regulatory molecular interaction
   paths, through which putative response regulators may lead to the
   measured transcriptomic changes. Computationally, this is achieved by
   formulating a minimum-cost flow optimization problem and solving it
   efficiently using linear programming tools. The ResponseNet web server
   offers a simple interface for applying ResponseNet. Users can upload
   weighted lists of proteins and genes and obtain a sparse, weighted,
   molecular interaction sub-network connecting their data. The predicted
   sub-network and its gene ontology enrichment analysis are presented
   graphically or as text. Consequently, the ResponseNet web server enables
   researchers that were previously limited to separate analysis of their
   distinct, large-scale experiments, to meaningfully integrate their data
   and substantially expand their understanding of the underlying cellular
   response. ResponseNet is available at http://bioinfo.bgu.ac.il/respnet.},

Abstract = {Social network analysis involves delicate and sophisticated mathematical

   deeper conceptual understanding and, therefore, better attainment levels
   of the course learning outcomes in a female setting. The work also
   highlights the overall experience and enjoyment this tool brought to the
   classroom. Document analysis and questionnaire were used as data

Abstract = {Attribute-oriented programming (@OP) permits programmers to extend the
   semantics of a base program by annotating it with attributes defined in
   an attribute domain-specific language (AttDSL). In this article, we
   propose AVal: a Java5 framework for the definition and checking of rules
   for @OP in Java. We define a set of meta-annotations to allow the
   validation of @OP programs, as well as the means to extend these
   meta-annotations by using a compile-time model of the program's source
   code. AVal is fully integrated into the Eclipse IDE. We show the
   usefulness of the approach by using examples of its use applied to three
   AttDSLs: an @OP framework that helps programming Simple API for XML
   parsers, an @OP extension for the Fractal component model called
   Fraclet, and the JSR 181 for web services definition. Copyright (C) 2007

Abstract = {Although information and communication technology (ICT) has a radical
   impact on people's everyday lives, bringing new social experiences and
   new ways for people to interact, there is still a large difference in
   social behaviour in this area between people in different age groups.
   Online social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn etc. are
   becoming increasingly important social media, but people aged 50 years
   and over use these resources at lower rates than those in younger age
   groups. In this paper we aim to investigate the factors affecting the
   use of online social networks by active older Internet users in
   Slovenia. Additionally, we address how often, and to what extent, active
   older Internet users are engaged in using ICT. A research study is
   presented that was conducted among active older Internet users, on the
   basis of a non-standardised research questionnaire. Collected data were
   analysed with basic descriptive, univariate and multivariate statistical
   methods, followed by induction of a decision tree using the WEKA
   (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) 3.7 programming
   environment. Research findings revealed that female participants are
   more familiar with the term `online social network' and are also more
   frequent users, compared to male participants. Additionally, the results
   showed that age, gender and education seem to be the most important
   factors having a direct or indirect impact on the use of online social
   networks by active older Internet users. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {With the explosive growth of the Web, it becomes essential for
   developing a program to educate students to comprehend how to develop

   Object Web technology. Unified Modeling Language (UML) is applied to
   analyze and design the SCIS framework that contains two major
   components: the Information Coordinator Component and the Agent
   Component. Demonstration results indicate that this SCIS framework
   provides a collaborative, event-driven, object-oriented, and agent-based
   infrastructure for the supply chain members to mutually exchange
   information efficiently. Educational aspects concerning development
   procedures, development tools, software reuse, and a system interface

Abstract = {Background: Clouds and MapReduce have shown themselves to be a broadly
   useful approach to scientific computing especially for parallel data
   intensive applications. However they have limited applicability to some
   areas such as data mining because MapReduce has poor performance on
   problems with an iterative structure present in the linear algebra that
   underlies much data analysis. Such problems can be run efficiently on
   clusters using MPI leading to a hybrid cloud and cluster environment.
   This motivates the design and implementation of an open source Iterative
   MapReduce system Twister.
   Results: Comparisons of Amazon, Azure, and traditional Linux and Windows
   environments on common applications have shown encouraging performance
   and usability comparisons in several important non iterative cases.
   These are linked to MPI applications for final stages of the data
   analysis. Further we have released the open source Twister Iterative
   MapReduce and benchmarked it against basic MapReduce (Hadoop) and MPI in
   information retrieval and life sciences applications.
   Conclusions: The hybrid cloud (MapReduce) and cluster (MPI) approach
   offers an attractive production environment while Twister promises a
   uniform programming environment for many Life Sciences applications.
   Methods: We used commercial clouds Amazon and Azure and the NSF resource
   FutureGrid to perform detailed comparisons and evaluations of different
   approaches to data intensive computing. Several applications were
   developed in MPI, MapReduce and Twister in these different environments.},

   selection, and composition processes often performed by traditional web
   services, our work also includes an adaptive mechanism through which the
   user can iteratively modify composite robotic services to suit his or

Abstract = {Web application vulnerability scanners (WAVS) include crawler components
   to extract all accessible links of tested web pages in order to identify
   attack entry points and parameters. After extracting links, they perform
   different types of attacks over each extracted link and try to find out
   existing vulnerabilities in the tested web application for reporting. A
   WAVS tool that has a low-quality crawler component would generate
   false-negative results, since failing to discover existing links would
   inhibit detection of possible vulnerabilities exposed through these
   links. Therefore, the coverage quality of its crawler plays a very
   important role in the success of a WAVS tool. In this paper, we propose
   a novel method for analyzing and comparing coverage qualities of WAVS
   crawlers. We developed WIVET (Web Input Vector Extractor Teaser) as a
   benchmarking tool for analyzing crawler components of WAVS. WIVET
   evaluates WAVS crawlers based on their extraction capability of 56
   target links that are generated statically or dynamically by WIVET's 21
   test cases. We explain WIVET's architecture, all WIVET test cases and
   target links with code examples, integration of WIVET into WAVS

Abstract = {Concurrency control is one of the key problems in design and
   implementation of collaborative systems such as hypertext! hypermedia
   systems, CAD/CAM systems, and software development environments. Most
   existing systems store data in specialized databases with built-in
   concurrency control policies, usually implemented via locking. It is
   desirable to construct such collaborative systems on top of the World
   Wide Web, but most Web servers do not support even conventional
   transactions, let alone distributed (multi-Website) transactions or
   flexible concurrency control mechanisms oriented toward teamwork-such as
   event notification, shared locks, and fine granularity locks. We present
   a transaction server that operates independently of Web servers or the
   collaborative systems, to fill the concurrency control gap. By default,
   the transaction server enforces the conventional atomic transaction
   model, where sets of operations are performed in an all-or-nothing
   fashion and isolated from concurrent users. The server can be tailored
   dynamically to apply more sophisticated concurrency control policies
   appropriate for collaboration. The transaction server also supports
   applications employing information resources other than Web servers,
   such as legacy databases, CORBA objects, and other hypermedia systems.
   Our implementation permits a wide range of system architecture styles.},

Abstract = {Background: Currently. there is no consensus on the efficacy and safety
   of the entecavir (ETV) monotherapy versus the ETV based combination
   therapy for chronic hepatitis B.
   Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed on the
   comparison of ETV-based combination therapy and monotherapy for
   chronical hepatitis B (CHB) patients in the PubMed, Embase, Web of
   Science, the Cochrane Libraries, and the Chinese BioMedical Literature
   Database. Both dichotomous and continuous variables were extracted. and

Title = {Deep integro-difference equation models for spatio-temporal forecasting},
Journal = {SPATIAL STATISTICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {37},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Integro-difference equation (IDE) models describe the conditional
   dependence between the spatial process at a future time point and the
   process at the present time point through an integral operator.
   Nonlinearity or temporal dependence in the dynamics is often captured by
   allowing the operator parameters to vary temporally, or by re-fitting a
   model with a temporally-invariant linear operator in a sliding window.
   Both procedures tend to be excellent for prediction purposes over small
   time horizons, but are generally time-consuming and, crucially, do not
   provide a global prior model for the temporally-varying dynamics that is
   realistic. Here, we tackle these two issues by using a deep convolution
   neural network (CNN) in a hierarchical statistical IDE framework, where
   the CNN is designed to extract process dynamics from the process' most
   recent behaviour. Once the CNN is fitted, probabilistic forecasting can
   be done extremely quickly online using an ensemble Kalman filter with no
   requirement for repeated parameter estimation. We conduct an experiment
   where we train the model using 13 years of daily sea-surface temperature
   data in the North Atlantic Ocean. Forecasts are seen to be accurate and
   calibrated. A key advantage of our approach is that the CNN provides a
   global prior model for the dynamics that is realistic, interpretable,
   and computationally efficient. We show the versatility of the approach
   by successfully producing 10-minute nowcasts of weather radar
   reflectivities in Sydney using the same model that was trained on daily
   sea-surface temperature data in the North Atlantic Ocean. (C) 2020

Journal = {LCGC EUROPE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {36},

Abstract = {Biologics, and in particular monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), are an
   important class of therapeutics, and their market share keeps growing.
   The production of antibodies is a complex and lengthy process.
   In-process characterization of the mAb would help in optimizing the
   production steps. Efficiency in mAb characterization can be obtained by
   automating analysis and reducing hands-on time. Although mass
   spectrometry (MS) is an essential technique for detailed
   characterization of biomolecules, its use is limited to purified
   samples. However, the hyphenation of an MS system to two-dimensional
   liquid chromatography (2D-LC) allows for the analysis of more complex
   samples. The first dimension of a 2D-LC system can be used to purify the
   sample from its matrix or separate compounds using mobile phases that
   are not MS-compatible, whereas the second dimension coupled to MS can be
   used to desalt or separate the different variants or species obtained on
   the first dimension. A 2D-LC-MS system installed in a full good
   manufacturing practice (GMP)-compliant environment using validated
   software was used for the characterization of mAbs in complex mixtures
   at the intact and subunit levels using a Protein A affinity column with
   no sample preparation steps. In the second application, MS
   characterization of mAb subunits was made possible by digestion of the
   mAb online by an immobilized IdeS enzyme. The addition of a disulfide
   bridge reduction step online led to analyzing smaller molecules to
   access fine characterization.},

Abstract = {WEBDIETAID is a Web-based system aimed at assisting individuals affected
   by high serum cholesterol. The system tries to reproduce the types of
   intervention performed by a nutritional counselor. It is structured as a
   set of advisors, each of which handles a different side of the
   counseling process. The tasks of the advisors range from monitoring
   weight, to teaching about healthy nutrition, to assessing motivation and
   psychological obstacles to behavior change. WEBDIETAID is based on a
   development environment for Web-based applications that includes a
   dynamical Web server, a knowledge base management system, and an
   interface to a relational database. We describe the architecture of the
   system, and several of the implemented advisors. Finally, we discuss how
   the architecture could be generalized to other counseling domains.},

Journal = {LCGC NORTH AMERICA},

Volume = {40},

Abstract = {Biologics, and in particular monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), are an
   important class of therapeutics, and their market share keeps growing.
   The production of antibodies is a complex and lengthy process.
   In-process characterization of the mAb would help in optimizing the
   production steps. Efficiency in mAb characterization can be obtained by
   automating analysis and reducing hands-on time. Although mass
   spectrometry (MS) is an essential technique for detailed
   characterization of biomolecules, its use is limited to purified
   samples. However, the hyphenation of an MS system to two-dimensional
   liquid chromatography (2D-LC) allows for the analysis of more complex
   samples. The first dimension of a 2D-LC system can be used to purify the
   sample from its matrix or separate compounds using mobile phases that
   are not MS-compatible, whereas the second dimension coupled to MS can be
   used to desalt or separate the different variants or species obtained on
   the first dimension. A 2D-LC-MS system installed in a full good
   manufacturing practice (GMP)-compliant environment using validated
   software was used for the characterization of mAbs in complex mixtures
   at the intact and subunit levels using a Protein A affinity column with
   no sample preparation steps. In the second application, MS
   characterization of mAb subunits was made possible by digestion of the
   mAb online by an immobilized IdeS enzyme. The addition of a disulfide
   bridge reduction step online led to analyzing smaller molecules to
   access fine characterization.},

Abstract = {In recent years, playful design environments and digital games have been
   offering increasingly accessible programming tools and integrated
   editors, significantly expanding opportunities for the creation and

   design-driven environments dedicated to game levels created with the
   popular series LittleBigPlanet. Findings suggest that participants
   interact guided by their desire to become skilled designers and be
   recognized as such by their peers. To do so, they enact situated
   discursive functions that entail a pervasive use of specialist language,
   the formation of shared design references, and the valorization of new
   forms of originality based on remixing and intertextuality. By engaging
   in multimodal practices in a competent community of peer designers,
   participants create a safe ``discursive studio{''} that offers a

Abstract = {With the widespread use of mobile applications in daily life, it has
   become crucial for enterprise software companies to quickly develop
   these applications for multiple platforms. Cross-platform mobile
   application development is one of the most adopted solutions for rapid
   development. Since most of these solutions do not generate native code
   for the underlying platform, the artefacts generally do not satisfy the
   requirements defined at the beginning of the project. This study
   designed and implemented a native code generation framework called
   Nativator built as a cloud service. The framework, which is capable of
   producing native code for iOS and Android platforms using web-based user
   interfaces, was implemented based on an open source compiler platform
   called ``Roslyn{''}. Four case studies were performed to analyze the
   execution performance of the applications built with the proposed
   framework. The experimental results demonstrated that the execution
   performance of the applications built with Nativator is comparable with
   the applications generated via the state-of-the-art mobile application
   development framework called Xamarin. Because this framework was
   implemented as a cloud service, it has several advantages over
   traditional approaches such as access from anywhere, no installation and
   flexible and more resources from cloud infrastructure.},

Title = {Lexicon-based Bot-aware Public Emotion Mining and Sentiment Analysis of
   the Nigerian 2019 Presidential Election on Twitter},

Abstract = {Online social networks have been widely engaged as rich potential
   platforms to predict election outcomes' in several countries of the
   world. The vast amount of readily-available data on such platforms,
   coupled with the emerging power of natural language processing
   algorithms and tools, have made it possible to mine and generate
   foresight into the possible directions of elections' outcome. In this
   paper, lexicon-based public emotion mining and sentiment analysis were
   conducted to predict win in the 2019 presidential election in Nigeria.
   224,500 tweets, associated with the two most prominent political parties
   in Nigeria, People's Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressive Congress
   (APC), and the two most prominent presidential candidates that
   represented these parties in the 2019 elections, Atiku Abubakar and
   Muhammadu Buhari, were collected between 9th October 2018 and 17th
   December 2018 via the Twitter's streaming API. tm and NRC libraries,
   defined in the `R' integrated development environment, were used for
   data cleaning and preprocessing purposes. Botometer was introduced to
   detect the presence of automated bots in the preprocessed data while NRC
   Word Emotion Association Lexicon (EmoLex) was used to generate
   distributions of subjective public sentiments and emotions that surround
   the Nigerian 2019 presidential election. Emotions were grouped into
   eight categories (sadness, trust, anger, fear, joy, anticipation,
   disgust, surprise) while sentiments were grouped into two (negative and
   positive) based on Plutchik's emotion wheel. Results obtained indicate a
   higher positive and a lower negative sentiment for APC than was observed
   with PDP. Similarly, for the presidential aspirants, Atiku has a
   slightly higher positive and a slightly lower negative sentiment than
   was observed with Buhari. These results show that APC is the predicted
   winning party and Atiku as the most preferred winner of the 2019
   presidential election. These predictions were corroborated by the actual
   election results as APC emerged as the winning party while Buhari and
   Atiku shared very close vote margin in the election. Hence, this
   research is an indication that twitter data can be appropriately used to
   predict election outcomes and other offline future events. Future
   research could investigate spatiotemporal dimensions of the prediction.},

Abstract = {The problem of service and resource matching is being actively discussed
   currently as a new challenging task for the next generation of semantic
   discovery approaches for Web services and Web agents. A significant
   advantage is expected when using an ontological approach to semantically
   describe and query services. A matchmaking problem arises when a service
   is being queried and it includes the distance measure between the
   required service description and the one from the service registry. We
   realized the need to analyze the applicability of different matchmaking
   methods to agent development tools when implemented according to agent
   technology specifications such as FIPA. We consider three main groups of
   cases: matchmaking between classes of service profiles in pure
   taxonomies, matchmaking between classes in faceted taxonomies, and
   matchmaking between instances of faceted taxonomies.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {E100D},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1210-1217},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The software development process is front-loaded when formal
   specification is deployed and as a consequence more problems are
   identified and solved at an earlier point of time. This places extra
   importance on the quality and efficiency of the different formal
   specification tasks. We use the term ``exploratory modeling{''} to
   denote the modeling that is conducted during the early stages of
   software development before the requirements are clearly understood. We
   believe tools that support not only rigorous but also flexible
   construction of the specification at the same time are helpful in such
   exploratory modeling phases. This paper presents a web-based IDE named
   VDMPad to demonstrate the concept of exploratory modeling. VDMPad has
   been evaluated by experienced professional VDM engineers from industry.
   The positive evaluation resulting from such industrial users are
   presented. It is believed that flexible and rigorous tools for
   exploratory modeling will help to improve the productivity of the
   industrial software developments by making the formal specification
   phase more efficient.},

Abstract = {Let's HPC (www.letshpc.org) is an evolving open-access web-based
   platform to supplement conventional classroom oriented High Performance
   Computing (HPC) and Parallel \& Distributed Computing (PDC) education.
   This platform has been developed to allow users to learn, evaluate,
   teach and see the performance of parallel algorithms from a system's
   viewpoint. The Let's HPC platform's motivation comes from the
   experiences of teaching HPC/PDC courses and it is designed to help
   streamline the process of analyzing parallel programs.
   At the heart of this platform is a database archiving the performance
   and execution environment related data of standard parallel algorithm
   implementations run on different computing architectures using different
   programming environments. The online plotting and analysis tools of our
   platform can be combined seamlessly with the database to aid
   self-learning, teaching, evaluation and discussion of different HPC
   related topics, with a particular focus on a holistic system's
   perspective. The user can quantitatively compare and understand the
   importance of numerous deterministic as well as non deterministic
   factors of both the software and the hardware that impact the
   performance of parallel programs. Instructors of HPC/PDC related courses
   can use the platform's tools to illustrate the importance of proper data
   collection and analysis in understanding factors impacting performance
   as well as to encourage peer learning among students. Scripts are
   provided for automatically collecting performance related data, which
   can then be analyzed using the platform's tools. The platform also
   allows students to prepare a standard lab/project report aiding the
   instructor in uniform evaluation. The platform's modular design enables
   easy inclusion of performance related data from contributors as well as
   addition of new features in the future.
   This paper summarizes the background and motivation behind the Let's HPC
   project, the design philosophy of the platform, the present capabilities
   of the platform, as well as the plans for future developments. (C) 2018

   useful, because of the proliferation of mobile devices which allow
   Internet access anytime and anywhere. However, vocal interface is
   sequential and not persistent, and thus, we have to restructure the
   information in order to achieve an efficient and natural way of
   interaction. Our proposal is based on converting original web contents
   into VoiceXML dialogues, using VoiceXML templates and extraction rules
   written in XSLT. Our system has two main components: a development tool
   to build voice applications and a transcoding server to access them. We
   have identified five typical HTML patterns and designed a way to browse

   This initiative exploits high-bandwidth communication networks for
   collaborative research and for shared access to knowledge resources. The
   Virtual Kidney has been developed within a specialist community of renal
   scientists but is transferable to other areas of research requiring
   interaction between published literature and databases, theoretical
   models and simulations and the formulation of effective experimental
   designs.
   A web-based three-dimensional interface provides access to experimental
   data, a parameter database and mathematical models. A multi-scale kidney
   reconstruction includes blood vessels and serially sectioned nephrons.
   Selection of structures provides links to the database, returning
   parameter values and extracts from the literature.
   Models are run locally or remotely with a Grid resource broker managing
   scheduling, monitoring and visualization of simulation results and
   application, credential and resource allocation. Simulation results are
   viewed graphically or as scaled colour gradients on the Virtual Kidney
   structures, allowing visual and quantitative appreciation of the effects

Abstract = {The fast Fourier transform (FFT) and the power spectrum are still
   powerful tools for analyzing and measuring both stationary and transient

   efficiently reduced by understanding fundamentals of FFT as well as
   loading proper windows. This article develops a distance e-learning

Abstract = {Some chaotic systems can be realized with different nonlinear functions.
   These systems consist of a fixed main system block and a changeable
   nonlinear function block. Studying with these generalized systems is
   very useful from the educational point of view including general
   modeling and design issues of chaotic systems. SIMULINK, a graphical
   programming tool, offers a very good environment for dynamic modeling of
   such generalized chaotic systems. This paper presents generalized two
   chaotic systems, which can be utilized in chaotic system modeling for
   engineering applications and the use of SIMULINK in dynamical modeling

Title = {Neo-Fuzzy Integrated Adaptive Decayed Brain Emotional Learning Network
   for Online},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Pages = {1037-1049},
Abstract = {Adaptive decayed brain emotional learning (ADBEL) network is recently
   proposed for the online time series forecasting problems. As opposed to
   other popular learning networks, such as multilayer perceptron, adaptive
   neuro-fuzzy inference system, and locally linear neuro-fuzzy model,
   ADBEL network offers lower computational complexity and fast learning,
   which make it an ideal candidate for the time series prediction in an
   online fashion. In fact, these prominent features are inherited from the
   mechanism employed by the limbic system of the mammalian brain in
   processing the external stimuli, which also forms the basis of the ADBEL
   network. This paper aims at further enhancing the forecasting
   performance of the ADBEL network through its integration with a
   neo-fuzzy network. The selection of the neo-fuzzy network is made as it
   offers features required for online prediction in real time environments
   including simplicity, transparency, accuracy, and lower computational
   complexity. Furthermore, this integration is only considered in the
   orbitofrontal cortex section of the ADBEL network and only three
   membership functions are employed to realize the neo-fuzzy neuron. Thus,
   the resultant neo-fuzzy integrated ADBEL (NF-ADBEL) network is still
   simple and can be deployed in online prediction problems. Few chaotic
   time series namely the Mackey glass, Lorenz, Rossler, and the
   Disturbance storm time index as well as the Narendra dynamic plant
   identification problem are used to evaluate the performance of the
   proposed NF-ADBEL network in terms of the root mean squared error and
   correlation coefficient criterions using MATLAB (R) programming
   environment.},

Title = {Enhance Composed Image Retrieval via Multi-Level Collaborative
   Localization and Semantic Activeness Perception},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {26},
Pages = {916-928},
Abstract = {Composed image retrieval (CIR) is an emerging and challenging research
   task that combines two modalities, a reference image, and a modification
   text, into one query to retrieve the target image. In online shopping
   scenarios, the user would use the modification text as feedback to
   describe the difference between the reference and the desired image. In
   order to handle the task, there must be two main problems needed to be
   addressed. One is the localization problem: how to precisely find those
   spatial areas of the image mentioned by the text. The other is the
   modification problem: how to effectively modify the image semantics
   based on the text. However, existing methods merely fuse information
   coarsely from the two-modality, while the accurate spatial and semantic
   correspondence between these two heterogeneous features tends to be
   neglected. Therefore, image details cannot be precisely located and
   modified. To this end, we consider integrating information from the two
   modalities more accurately from spatial and semantic aspects. Thus, we
   propose an end-to-end framework for the CIR task, which contains three
   key components, i.e., Multi-level Collaborative Localization module
   (MCL), Differential Semantics Discrimination module (DSD), and Image
   Difference Enhancement constraints (IDE). Specifically, to solve the
   localization problem, MCL precisely locates the text to the image areas
   by collaboratively using text positioning information on multiple image
   layers. For the modification problem, DSD builds a distribution to
   evaluate the modification possibility of each image semantic dimension,
   and IDE effectively learns the modification patterns of text against
   image embedding based on the distribution. Extensive experiments on
   three datasets show that the proposed method achieves outstanding
   performance against the SOTA methods.},

Year = {2010},
Volume = {78},
Pages = {223-270},
Abstract = {A cornerstone of Web project management is sound effort estimation, the
   process by which effort is predicted and used to determine costs and
   allocate resources effectively, thus enabling projects to be delivered
   on time and within budget. Effort estimation is a complex domain where
   the causal relationship among factors is nondeterministic with an
   inherently uncertain nature. For example, assuming there is a
   relationship between development effort and developers' experience using
   the development environment, it is not necessarily true that higher
   experience will lead to decreased effort. However, as experience
   increases so does the probability of decreased effort. The objective of
   this chapter is to provide an introduction to the process of estimating
   effort, discuss existing techniques used for effort estimation, and
   explain how a Web company can take into account the uncertainty inherent
   to effort estimation when preparing a quote. Therefore, this chapter is
   aimed to provide Web companies, researchers, and students with an
   introduction to the topic of Web effort estimation.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC DATA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},

Month = {JUL 28},
Abstract = {Floodplains provide critical ecosystem services; however, loss of
   natural floodplain functions caused by human alterations increase flood
   risks and lead to massive loss of life and property. Despite recent
   calls for improved floodplain protection and management, a
   comprehensive, global-scale assessment quantifying human floodplain
   alterations does not exist. We developed the first publicly available
   global dataset that quantifies human alterations in 15 million km(2)
   floodplains along 520 major river basins during the recent 27 years
   (1992-2019) at 250-m resolution. To maximize the reuse of our dataset
   and advance the open science of human floodplain alteration, we
   developed three web-based programming tools supported with tutorials and
   step-by-step audiovisual instructions. Our data reveal a significant
   loss of natural floodplains worldwide with 460,000 km(2) of new
   agricultural and 140,000 km(2) of new developed areas between 1992 and
   2019. This dataset offers critical new insights into how floodplains are
   being destroyed, which will help decision-makers to reinforce strategies
   to conserve and restore floodplain functions and habitat.},

   Area in Vietnam},
Journal = {ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The early-warning model for flash floods is based on a hydrological and
   geomorphological concept connected to the river basin, with the
   principle that flash floods will only occur where there is a high
   potential risk and when rainfall exceeds the threshold. In the model
   used to build flash-floods risk maps, the parameters of the basin are
   analyzed and evaluated and the weight is determined using Thomas Saaty's
   analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The flash-floods early-warning
   software is built using open source programming tools. With the spatial
   module and online processing, a predicted precipitation of one to six
   days in advance for iMETOS (AgriMediaVietnam) automatic meteorological
   stations is interpolated and then processed with the potential risk maps
   (iMETOS is a weather-environment monitoring system comprising a wide
   range of equipment and an online platform and can be used in various
   fields such as agriculture, tourism and services). The results determine
   the locations of flash floods at several risk levels corresponding to
   the predicted rainfall values at the meteorological stations. The system
   was constructed and applied to flash floods disaster early warning for
   Thuan Chau in Son La province when the rainfall exceeded the 150 mm/d
   threshold. The system initially supported positive decision-making to
   prevent and minimize damage caused by flash floods.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Volume = {8},
Pages = {189823-189841},
Abstract = {Urdu language written in English alphabets for communication is known as
   Roman Urdu. In pronunciation, both are the same but different in
   spelling and have different shapes of the alphabet. A survey
   acknowledges that 300 million people are speaking Urdu and about 11
   million speakers in Pakistan from which maximum users prefer Roman Urdu
   for the textual communication. Today most of the modern technologies
   like computers and mobile phones using English script, due to this local
   Urdu user has to use English letters to type Urdu script that is Roman
   Urdu. In this research, Roman Urdu to Urdu Translator (RUTUT) is
   proposed that consists of preprocessing methods, rule-based character
   substitution and Unicode based character mapping techniques. It can
   transliterate the messages or descriptions from the Roman Urdu script to
   Urdu script which may help the Urdu speaker to elaborate their message
   in efficient manners. The focus of this research is to analyze the
   issues related to the Roman Urdu script to Urdu script transliteration
   and develop a translator based on the concepts of transliteration. This
   research analyzed Roman Urdu data and identified different rules-based
   character substitution techniques that transform the Roman Urdu into
   Urdu script at fundamental levels. This research is carried out using a
   python programming language in programming tool Anaconda in Jupiter
   notebook and user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) created by
   using Tkinter library. To evaluate the RUTUT, different translational
   tests are performed and compare those results with famous Google online
   translator and ijunoon online transliteration. The analyses of results
   show that the proposed RUTUT approach translates accurately than Google

Abstract = {Background and Aim Previous smaller meta-analyses comparing the
   incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB)
   patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) versus
   entecavir (ETV) provided controversial results. This updated
   meta-analysis aimed to reliably identify any difference in the HCC
   incidence between TDF-treated or ETV-treated CHB patients in general or
   in specific subgroups. Methods PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and
   Cochrane Library were systematically searched for relevant studies with
   hazard ratios (HRs) for HCC between TDF-treated and ETV-treated CHB
   patients. Retrieved dates ranged from January 2009 to October 2021. HRs
   with or without adjustment were pooled with random-effects model.
   Results Twenty-four comparative studies involving 37 771 CHB patients
   treated with TDF and 72 094 treated with ETV were included. TDF was
   associated with lower risk of HCC compared with ETV, with pooled
   unadjusted HR of 0.76 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 0.67-0.86) (24
   studies) and adjusted HR of 0.81 (95\% CI: 0.72-0.91) (21 studies). In
   propensity score matching cohorts, the TDF superiority was confirmed for
   unadjusted HR 0.83 (95\% CI: 0.71-0.97) (14 studies) and was close to
   significance for adjusted HR (0.78, 95\% CI: 0.58-1.04) (8 studies).
   Subgroup analyses showed that TDF was associated with lower HCC risk
   than ETV treatment in CHB patients who were from Asia (adjusted HR:
   0.76, 95\% CI: 0.66-0.87; 15 studies) or nucleos(t)ide naive (adjusted
   HR:0.74, 95\% CI: 0.65-0.84; 18 studies). Conclusion Current evidence
   from a sizable population suggests that TDF is associated with
   significantly lower HCC risk compared with ETV treatment in patients who
   are from Asia and/or nucleos(t)ide naive.},

Abstract = {The availability of environmentally related data is a crucial issue in
   simulating natural processes. The proposed research demonstrates that
   although currently there is a plethora of data published on the
   internet, by national and international official sources, their
   retrieval is sometimes hard to be achieved; hence smart programming
   tools/technologies could facilitate the automatic harvesting of these
   data in personal databases for the qualitative and quantitative
   assessment of hydrosystems that encompass hydropower schemes. The
   implemented methodology relies on the use of custom-made web scrapping
   tools to access dams' hourly outflows in combination with water demand
   data in order to investigate the water balance, as modified by human
   intervention, in areas located downstream of dams. For this purpose,
   derivatives of the Electricity Market Directive and Water Framework
   Directive of the European Union (EU) have been regarded as web-based
   databases. The outcomes of the methodological approach demonstrate that
   the modelled net water discharges downstream-i.e., the river discharges
   after subtracting the water demands-are assessed with high simulation
   accuracy at a daily time scale. The reliability of the output estimates
   is further supported by the combination of measured data from gauge
   telemetry with the data derived by the proposed methodology. This
   research allows new insights, such as dams' outflows and water demand
   retrieval and exploitation, into the sustainable management of water
   resources and contributes to the quantification of rivers' outflows to

Abstract = {There is growing interest in using intelligent software agents for a
   variety of tasks, including navigating and retrieving information from
   the Internet and from databases, online shopping activities, user
   authentication, negotiation for resources, and decision making. This
   paper proposes an integrated framework for information retrieval and
   information filtering in the context of Internet shopping. The work
   focuses on applying agent technology, together with Web mining
   technology, to automate a series of product search and selection
   activities. It is based on a multiagent development platform, namely,
   iJADE (Intelligent Java Agent Development Environment), which supports
   various e-commerce applications. The framework comprises an automatic
   facial authentication utility and six other modules, namely, customer
   requirements definition, a requirement-fuzzification scheme, a fuzzy
   agents-negotiation scheme, a fuzzy product-selection scheme, a
   product-defuzzification scheme, and a product-evaluation scheme. A
   series of experiments were carried out and favorable results were
   produced in executing the framework. From an experimental point of view,
   we used a database of 1,020 facial,images that were obtained under
   various conditions of facial expression, viewing perspective and size.
   An overall correct recognition rate of over 85 percent was attained. For
   the product selection test of our fuzzy shopper system, an average
   matching rate of more than 81 percent was achieved.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new framework for the dynamic enforcement of
   composite Web services security, which is based on a synergy between
   Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) and BPEL (Business Process Execution
   Language). This synergy is achieved through the elaboration of a new
   language called AspectBPEL, which is used to specify security policies
   as separate components, referred to as aspects, to be weaved
   systematically in a BPEL process. The injected aspects activate the
   security policies at runtime on specific join points. Our approach
   enjoys several additional features such as (1) separating the business
   and security concerns of composite Web services (2) allowing the update
   of security mechanisms of composite Web services at run time, (3)
   providing modularity for modeling cross-cutting concerns between Web
   services, (4) centralising some security measurements at the BPEL side
   and (5) providing a framework fully compatible with any BPEL engine
   regardless of the adopted development environment.},

Abstract = {Students taking introductory physics are rarely exposed to computational
   modeling. In a one-semester large lecture introductory calculus-based

   1357 students in this course solved a suite of 14 computational modeling
   homework questions delivered using an online commercial course
   management system. Their proficiency with computational modeling was
   evaluated with a proctored assignment involving a novel central force
   problem. The majority of students (60.4\%) successfully completed the
   evaluation. Analysis of erroneous student-submitted programs indicated
   that a small set of student errors explained why most programs failed.
   We discuss the design and implementation of the computational modeling

Abstract = {Aims SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus which is part of the
   ss-coronavirus family (like SARS 2002 and MERS 2012). The high
   prevalence of hospitalization and mortality, in addition to the lack of
   vaccines and therapeutics, forces scientists and clinicians around the
   world to evaluate new therapeutic options. One strategy is the
   repositioning of already known drugs, which were approved drugs for
   other indications.
   Subject and method SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors, RNA polymerase
   inhibitors, and protease inhibitors seem to be valuable targets of
   research. At the beginning of the pandemic, the webpage listed n=479
   clinical trials related to the antiviral treatment of SARS-CoV-2
   (01.04.2020, ``SARS-CoV-2,{''} ``COVID-19,{''} ``antivirals,{''}
   ``therapy{''}), of which n=376 are still accessible online in January
   2021 (10.01.2021). Taking into account further studies not listed in the
   CTG webpage, this narrative review appraises HIV protease inhibitors and
   nucleos(t)ide RNA polymerase inhibitors as promising candidates for the
   treatment of COVID-19.
   Results Lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir/cobicistat, remdesivir,
   tenofovir-disoproxilfumarate, favipriravir, and sofosbuvir are evaluated
   in clinical studies worldwide. Study designs show a high variability and
   results often are contradictory. Remdesivir is the drug, which is
   deployed in nearly 70\% of the reviewed clinical trials, followed by
   lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, ribavirine, and sofosbuvir.
   Discussion This review discusses the pharmacological/clinical background
   and questions the rationale and study design of clinical trials with
   already approved HIV protease inhibitors and nucleos(t)ide RNA
   polymerase inhibitors which are repositioned during the SARS-CoV-2
   pandemic worldwide. Proposals are made for future study design and drug
   repositioning of approved antiretroviral compounds.},

Abstract = {Building web applications for mobile and other non-desktop devices using
   established methods often requires a tremendous development effort. One
   of the major challenges is to find sound software engineering approaches
   enabling the cost efficient application development for multiple devices
   of varying technical characteristics. A new approach is to single author
   web content in a device independent markup language, which gets then
   adapted to meet the special characteristics of the accessing device.
   This paper describes our approach to single authoring, which was
   developed in the course a large European research project. The project
   has developed a device-independent language profile based on XHTML 2.0
   and implemented a compliant rendering engine. We focus on layout and
   pagination capabilities of the RIML (Renderer Independent Markup
   Language) and show how authors can be assisted by development tools

Abstract = {Missing data is a major data reliability problem in spatio-temporal (ST)
   applications. This article proposes an online method for estimating
   missing data in case of a network of n sensors. The true sensor value at
   a specific location is expressed using an integro-difference equation.
   The Karhunen-Loeve Expansion of the spatial process allows one to
   represent the ST field values at n locations in the form of a linear
   state-space model. The parameters of the model are identified using the
   maximum likelihood method. The parameters are updated in a rolling
   window approach. Whenever missing data are encountered, the algorithm
   predicts the missing observations based on the constrained solution of
   state evolution equation. The constrained solution is obtained by
   representing the optimal state as the orthogonal sum decomposition of a
   deterministic and a stochastic component. The utility of the algorithm
   is presented on two sensor network datasets.},

Title = {Overview and Architecture of the Java Integration Framework, Hybrid

Journal = {JALA},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Most of the scheduling software and instrument integration frameworks
   are written in Visual Basic, C/C++, or the LabView programming
   environment. A lot of these frameworks are proprietary tools of
   instrument vendors and are used by these companies during system
   integration of their instruments. In addition to the closed architecture
   of these products, the scheduler choice is very limited. ReTiSoft Inc.
   has created a suite of software products that address these problems.
   In this article we would like to introduce ReTiSoft's open-architecture
   framework for instrument integration, a hybrid scheduler (static and
   dynamic) and a Web-enabled interface to the automated system. In
   addition to ReTiSoft's integration framework (Genera) and the
   hybrid-scheduling software (Supra), we recently developed a Web-enabled
   application that allows scientists to log onto the automated system
   remotely, set up and run assays, examine and analyze the data produced
   during the experiment. The software is called DataPilot and is comprised
   of a high-performance database engine and the Apache Web server.
   In unison with Genera's and Supra's open-architecture approach,
   DataPilot can be modified and customized by system integrators to suit
   their specific application needs. The application serves as a data
   repository and adheres to guidelines presented by the Code of Federal
   Regulations for electronic records and electronic signatures; the
   guidelines are known as 21 CFR Part II.
   This article provides an architectural overview of our software products
   and justifies its merits in comparison to other technologies commonly
   used in laboratories. We describe our Genera integration framework, give
   an overview of our scheduling algorithms, describe a Web-enabled
   data-tracking software and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA
   assay), and describe different methods of automated system validation
   using our software. We also offer some conclusions. (JALA 2004;9:411-20)},

Abstract = {In this article, we investigated the different roles of
   dielectrophoresis (DEP) and AC electroosmosis (ACEO) phenomena in
   manipulating conductive and insulator particles as future fabrication
   and deposition technique. A computational model was implemented using
   the finite element method (FEM) to better understand the interplay and
   velocities caused by these two electrokinetic phenomena. The simulation
   results showed that Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) experience positive DEP
   (pDEP) up to frequencies of 1 GHz, while polystyrene (PS) particles only
   showed negative DEP (nDEP) regardless of the frequency. The velocity due
   to the ACEO was significant at the electrodes' level at low frequencies,
   especially between 100 Hz and 10 kHz. The simulation results were
   validated experimentally, where CNTs and PS were dispersed in a medium
   and subjected to non-uniform electric fields. The behavior and patterns
   the particles formed on planner interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) match
   with their trajectories from the simulation. At a frequency of 1 MHz,
   CNTs were attracted to regions with strong electric fields, while PS
   particles were repelled to regions with low electric fields indicating
   strong pDEP and nDEP, respectively. A cloud of particles was observed at
   5 kHz, indicating strong ACEO at low frequencies. This study provides a
   simplified and reliable technique that can be applied to manipulate
   different types of particles for future multilayer fabrication, thin
   film deposition, and lap-on-chip applications.},

Title = {Evolution of Increased Volcanic Activity in Arjuno-Welirang Based on LST
   Analysis of Landsat 8 Satellite Imagery Using GEE Cloud Computing},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Pages = {189-199},
Abstract = {Typically, monitoring the volcanic activity of a volcano is carried out
   using volcanic seismic methods. However, this method is technically less
   flexible. Volcano seismic data is not freely available. Access to these
   data centers must be authorized by the data authority. Therefore, it is
   necessary to use other methods as an alternative. The alternative method
   used in this study is remote sensing using the Landsat 8 satellite
   sensors. Landsat 8 satellite imagery data can be freely accessed and
   easily downloaded. Landsat 8 image analysis is implemented with Google
   Earth Engine (GEE). GEE is a remote sensing image analysis programming
   tool with a cloud computing platform. The GEE programming implementation
   is open source. With GEE, the evolution of Arjuno-Welirang volcanic
   activity can be monitored accurately. The use of GEE with a cloud
   computing platform also makes it easier to process large remote sensing
   data because the downloaded file's size is unlimited. GEE has
   successfully conducted an LST analysis on Landsat 8 satellite imagery of
   the Arjuno-Welirang complex area in the 2016-2021 range. The LST
   calculation is performed by adding the surface emissivity correction
   obtained based on the NDVI value. According to the results of the LST
   calculations that have been obtained, the surface temperature in the
   Arjuna Welirang Crater area experienced the highest increase in 2018,
   reaching 33.94 oC, with a larger contour size of thermal distribution
   image than the others. This increase in thermal based volcanic activity
   is in accordance with the increase in seismic activity monitored by the
   VSI (Volcanological Survey of Indonesia).},

Title = {LITERATE PROGRAMMING AND THE LIPED ENVIRONMENT},
Journal = {STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING},
Year = {1992},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-34},
Abstract = {Literate programming is a methodology that encourages the production of
   a program whose primary purpose is to explain to a human what it does,
   rather than to instruct a computer what to do. Each program element is
   clearly explained, and is presented in an order that is best for human
   understanding. The writer has the freedom to introduce parts of the
   program as they are needed-which is not necessarily the order required
   for compilation.
   The philosophy of literate programming was introduced by Donald Knuth
   while developing the documentation System TEX. His WEB system consists
   of two processes, WEAVE and TANGLE, that read a specially constructed
   literate program source file and produce as output a file containing
   compilable code and a file for input into TEX. WEB uses a batch approach
   that seems to hinder the development of new literate programs, and it
   has not been widely used outside its home base. The literate programming
   environment LIPED, described in this paper, aims to make the development
   of literate programs easier by being interactive (rather than batch as
   is WEB) and by providing instant access to a table of contents, a
   cross-reference table, and the extracted code. Language independence is
   achieved, and special facilities are made available to cater for modem
   programming paradigms. The system runs on minimal hardware and
   interfaces easily to existing compilers and text processors.
   This paper describes the background and progress of literate
   programming, compares the available literate programming systems, and
   provides an overview of LIPED.},

Title = {In-IDE Code Generation from Natural Language: Promise and Challenges},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A great part of software development involves conceptualizing or
   communicating the underlying procedures and logic that needs to be
   expressed in programs. One major difficulty of programming is turning
   concept into code, especially when dealing with the APIs of unfamiliar
   libraries. Recently, there has been a proliferation of machine learning
   methods for code generation and retrieval from natural language queries,
   but these have primarily been evaluated purely based on retrieval
   accuracy or overlap of generated code with developer written code, and
   the actual effect of these methods on the developer workflow is
   surprisingly unattested. In this article, we perform the first
   comprehensive investigation of the promise and challenges of using such
   technology inside the PyCharm IDE, asking, ``At the current state of
   technology does it improve developer productivity or accuracy, how does
   it affect the developer experience, and what are the remaining gaps and
   challenges?{''} To facilitate the study, we first develop a plugin for
   the PyCharm IDE that implements a hybrid of code generation and code
   retrieval functionality, and we orchestrate virtual environments to
   enable collection of many user events (e.g., web browsing, keystrokes,
   fine-grained code edits). We ask developers with various backgrounds to
   complete 7 varieties of 14 Python programming tasks ranging from basic
   file manipulation to machine learning or data visualization, with or
   without the help of the plugin. While qualitative surveys of developer
   experience are largely positive, quantitative results with regards to
   increased productivity, code quality, or program correctness are
   inconclusive. Further analysis identifies several pain points that could
   improve the effectiveness of future machine learning-based code
   generation/retrieval developer assistants and demonstrates when
   developers prefer code generation over code retrieval and vice versa. We
   release all data and software to pave the road for future empirical
   studies on this topic, as well as development of better code generation
   models.},

Title = {Deep-Learning-Incorporated Augmented Reality Application for Engineering
   Lab Training},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Deep learning (DL) algorithms have achieved significantly high
   performance in object detection tasks. At the same time, augmented
   reality (AR) techniques are transforming the ways that we work and
   connect with people. With the increasing popularity of online and hybrid
   learning, we propose a new framework for improving students' learning
   experiences with electrical engineering lab equipment by incorporating
   the abovementioned technologies. The DL powered automatic object
   detection component integrated into the AR application is designed to
   recognize equipment such as multimeter, oscilloscope, wave generator,
   and power supply. A deep neural network model, namely MobileNet-SSD v2,
   is implemented for equipment detection using TensorFlow's object
   detection API. When a piece of equipment is detected, the corresponding
   AR-based tutorial will be displayed on the screen. The mean average
   precision (mAP) of the developed equipment detection model is 81.4\%,
   while the average recall of the model is 85.3\%. Furthermore, to
   demonstrate practical application of the proposed framework, we develop
   a multimeter tutorial where virtual models are superimposed on real
   multimeters. The tutorial includes images and web links as well to help
   users learn more effectively. The Unity3D game engine is used as the
   primary development tool for this tutorial to integrate DL and AR
   frameworks and create immersive scenarios. The proposed framework can be
   a useful foundation for AR and machine-learning-based frameworks for
   industrial and educational training.},

Abstract = {Science gateway' (SG) ideology means a user-friendly intuitive interface
   between scientists (or scientific communities) and different software

   researchers can focus on their scientific goals and less on the
   peculiarities of software/DCI. G.V.Kurdyumov Institute for Metal Physics
   IMP Science Gateway Portal' () is presented for complex workflow
   management and integration of distributed computing resources (like
   clusters, service grids, desktop grids, and clouds). It is created on
   the basis of Web Service - Parallel Grid Run-time and Application
   Development Environment (WS-PGRADE) and gUSE (grid and cloud User
   Support Environment) technologies, where WS-PGRADE is designed for
   science workflow operation and gUSE for smooth integration of available
   resources for parallel and distributed computing in various
   heterogeneous DCIs. Some use cases (scientific workflows) are considered
   for molecular dynamics simulations of complex behavior of various
   nanostructures. The modular approach allows scientists to use SG portals
   as research hubs of various virtual experimental labs in the context of
   practical applications in material science, physics, and
   nanotechnologies. In addition, workflows and their components are
   proposed to be used as Lego-style construction units for learning
   modules of various scale by duration, complexity, targeted audience, and
   so on. These workflows can be used also in e-Learning infrastructures as
   constituent elements of learning hubs for the management of learning
   content, tools, resources, and users in the regular, vocational,

Abstract = {Quantum Cloud Computing is the technology which has the capability to

   type of cloud computing, the development environment is delivered as a

   developed with the mode of one master and N slaves together with a
   sequence of single photons. It can be applied to a multi-node network,
   in which a single photon sequence can be sent to all the slave nodes
   simultaneously. In broadcast communication networks, these single
   photons encode classical information directly through noisy quantum
   communication channels. The results show that this protocol can realize
   the secret key generation and sharing of multiple nodes. The protocol we
   propose is also proved to be unconditionally secure in theory, which
   indicates its feasibility in theoretical application.},

Abstract = {The future Internet is expected to be composed of a mesh of
   interoperable web services accessible from all over the web. This
   approach has not yet caught on since global user-service interaction is
   still an open issue. This paper states one vision with regard to
   next-generation front-end Web 2.0 technology that will enable integrated
   access to services, contents and things in the future Internet. In this
   paper, we illustrate how front-ends that wrap traditional services and
   resources can be tailored to the needs of end users, converting end
   users into prosumers (creators and consumers of service-based
   applications). To do this, we propose an architecture that end users
   without programming skills can use to create front-ends, consult
   catalogues of resources tailored to their needs, easily integrate and
   coordinate front-ends and create composite applications to orchestrate
   services in their back-end. The paper includes a case study illustrating
   that current user-centred web development tools are at a very early
   stage of evolution. We provide statistical data on how the proposed
   architecture improves these tools. This paper is based on research
   conducted by the Service Front End (SFE) Open Alliance initiative. (c)

Abstract = {``Change Impact Analysis{''} is the process of determining the

   changes do not introduce new bugs. Many approaches and techniques are
   proposed to help programmers do change impact analysis automatically.
   However, it is still an open question whether and how programmers do
   change impact analysis. In this paper, we conducted two studies, one
   in-depth study and one breadth study. For the in-depth study, we
   recorded videos of nine professional programmers repairing two bugs for
   two hours. For the breadth study, we surveyed 35 professional
   programmers using an online system. We found that the programmers in our
   studies did static change impact analysis before they made changes by
   using IDE navigational functionalities, and they did dynamic change
   impact analysis after they made changes by running the programs. We also
   found that they did not use any change impact analysis tools.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a novel blockchain-based decentralized federation
   model that embodies quality verification for cloud providers who lease
   computing resources from each other. The blockchain structure removes
   the barriers of a traditional centralized federation and offers a fully
   distributed and transparent administration by enforcing the involved
   agents to maintain consensus on the data. For a blockchain-based
   federation, it is vital to avoid blind-trust on the claimed SLA
   guarantees and monitor the quality of service which is highly desirable
   considering the multi-tenancy characteristic of cloud services. Due to
   the fact that the blockchain network is unable to access the outside
   world, it cannot handle, by its own, providers misbehavior in terms of
   SLA violations. Thus, we introduce oracle as a verifier agent to monitor
   the quality of the service and report to the smart contract agents
   deployed on the blockchain. Oracle is a trusted third-party agent who
   can communicate with the outside world of the blockchain network. The
   interaction between cloud service providers (either providing a service
   or requesting it from another provider) and the oracle through smart
   contracts comprises a system of autonomous and utility maximizer agents.
   Cloud requesters seek to receive high quality services with constant
   monitoring at cheap prices or even with no charge, while cloud providers
   aim to have a balanced work-load with less preserved capacity, and the
   oracle tends to charge higher for their monitoring services. Therefore,
   to model this conflicting situation, we formulate a dynamic Stackelberg
   differential game to optimize the cost of using the oracle and maximize
   the profit of the agents with the role of provider agent as a leader,
   and the requester and verifier agents as followers. Our designed
   Stackelberg differential game can seize the dynamicity of users' demand
   and resource provisioning in a competitive cloud market. We implemented
   our proposed decentralized model using the Solidity language in the
   remix IDE on the Ethereum network. We further evaluated the optimal
   controls and agents' profit with real-world data simulated for three
   concrete cloud providers. The results revealed that the requester agent
   initiates most of the quality verification requests at the beginning to
   the middle time of the contract. Thus, the provider agent could reserve
   less computing resources considering the fact that it could share the
   workload among other customers' computing resources during the
   peak-time. Moreover, imposing a higher penalty on the provider agent
   increased the capacity and decreased the number of requests for quality
   verification at the equilibrium. The evaluation also disclosed that the
   impact of timing in the dynamic pricing strategy of the verifier agent
   is very minimal, and the provisioning capacity of the provider is
   strongly correlated with the monitoring price.},

Abstract = {Quality control (QC) is a crucial step in single-cell RNA-seq data
   analysis. Here, the authors present the SCTK-QC pipeline which generates
   and visualizes a comprehensive set of QC metrics to streamline the
   process of detecting and removing poor quality cells and other
   artifacts.
   Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be used to gain insights into
   cellular heterogeneity within complex tissues. However, various
   technical artifacts can be present in scRNA-seq data and should be
   assessed before performing downstream analyses. While several tools have
   been developed to perform individual quality control (QC) tasks, they
   are scattered in different packages across several programming
   environments. Here, to streamline the process of generating and
   visualizing QC metrics for scRNA-seq data, we built the SCTK-QC pipeline
   within the singleCellTK R package. The SCTK-QC workflow can import data
   from several single-cell platforms and preprocessing tools and includes
   steps for empty droplet detection, generation of standard QC metrics,
   prediction of doublets, and estimation of ambient RNA. It can run on the
   command line, within the R console, on the cloud platform or with an
   interactive graphical user interface. Overall, the SCTK-QC pipeline
   streamlines and standardizes the process of performing QC for scRNA-seq
   data.},

Journal = {MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES AND ENGINEERING},

Volume = {21},

Pages = {1508-1526},
Abstract = {Phase-type distributions (PHDs), which are defined as the distribution
   of the lifetime up to the absorption in an absorbent Markov chain, are
   an appropriate candidate to model the lifetime of any system, since any
   non-negative probability distribution can be approximated by a PHD with
   sufficient precision. Despite PHD potential, friendly statistical
   programs do not have a module implemented in their interfaces to handle
   PHD. Thus, researchers must consider others statistical software such as
   R, Matlab or Python that work with the compilation of code chunks and
   functions. This fact might be an important handicap for those
   researchers who do not have sufficient knowledge in programming
   environments. In this paper, a new interactive web application developed
   with shiny is introduced in order to adjust PHD to an experimental
   dataset. This open access app does not require any kind of knowledge
   about programming or major mathematical concepts. Users can easily
   compare the graphic fit of several PHDs while estimating their
   parameters and assess the goodness of fit with just several clicks. All
   these functionalities are exhibited by means of a numerical simulation
   and modeling the time to live since the diagnostic in primary breast
   cancer patients.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a geospatial analysis framework and software to
   interpret water-quality sampling data from towed undulating vehicles in
   near-real time. The framework includes data quality assurance and
   quality control processes, automated kriging interpolation along
   undulating paths, and local hotspot and cluster analyses. These methods
   are implemented in an interactive Web application developed using the
   Shiny package in the R programming environment to support near-real time
   analysis along with 2-and 3-D visualizations. The approach is
   demonstrated using historical sampling data from an undulating vehicle
   deployed at three rivermouth sites in Lake Michigan during 2011. The
   normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) of the interpolation averages
   approximately 10\% in 3-fold cross validation. The results show that the
   framework can be used to track river plume dynamics and provide insights
   on mixing, which could be related to wind and seiche events. (C) 2017

Abstract = {Containers have taken over large swaths of cloud computing as the most
   convenient way of packaging and deploying applications. The features
   that containers offer for packaging and deploying applications translate
   to high performance computing (HPC) as well. At The National Oceanic and

   distribute complex HPC applications, allowing faster collaboration,
   portability, and experiment computer environment reproducibility amongst
   the scientific community. The challenge arises when applications rely on
   message passing interface (MPI). This necessitates investigation into
   how to properly run these applications with their own unique
   requirements and produce performance on par with native runs. We
   investigate the MPI performance for benchmarks and containerized climate
   models for various containers covering selection of compiler and MPI
   library combinations from the Cray provided programming environments on
   the Cray XC supercomputer GAEA. Performance from the benchmarks and the
   climate models shows that for the most part containerized applications
   perform on par with the natively built applications when the system
   optimized Cray MPICH libraries are bound into the container, and the
   hybrid model containers have poor performance in comparison. We also
   describe several challenges and our solutions in running these
   containers, particularly challenges with heterogeneous jobs for the

Abstract = {We present two controlled experiments conducted with master students and

   the use of MELIS (Migration Environment for Legacy Information Systems)
   for the migration of legacy COBOL programs to the web. MELIS has been
   developed as an Eclipse plug-in within a technology transfer project
   conducted with a small software company {[}16]. The partner company has
   developed and marketed in the last 30 years several COBOL systems that
   need to be migrated to the web, due to the increasing requests of the
   customers. The goal of the technology transfer project was to define a
   systematic migration strategy and the supporting tools to migrate these
   COBOL systems to the web and make the partner company an owner of the
   developed technology. The goal of the controlled experiments and case
   study was to evaluate the effectiveness of introducing MELIS in the
   partner company and compare it with traditional software development
   environments. The results of the overall experimentation show that the
   use of MELIS increases the productivity and reduces the gap between
   novice and expert software engineers. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The service oriented architecture and its implementation by Web services
   have reached a considerable degree of maturity and also a wide adoption
   in different application domains. This is true for the R\&D as well as
   for the industrial community. Standards for the description, activation,
   and combination of Web services have been established; UDDI registries
   are in place for the management of services, and development
   environments support the software engineer in the creation of Web
   services.
   However, the major benefit of service oriented architectures, the loose
   coupling of services, is still seldom explored in real world settings.
   The reason is the heterogeneity on different levels within the service
   oriented architecture. The heterogeneity problems reach from the
   semantics of service descriptions to compatibility problems between
   workflows, which have to be connected via service interfaces. In spite
   of compatible service signatures, workflows might, for example, not be
   compatible in their semantics.
   This talk discusses challenges and solutions for a real Plug\&Play.
   service infrastructure, i.e. a Web service infrastructure, where
   integration of new Web services becomes as simple and straightforward as
   plugging a USB stick into your laptop. To achieve this goal various
   issues have to be addressed:
   Semantics of services as a foundation for intelligent service mediation
   and usage
   Effective, automatic, and intelligent service discovery taking into
   account application context
   Dynamic context-aware composition of services into processes
   The challenges and approaches for a ``Plug\&Play{''} service
   infrastructure are illustrated with a real world example.},

Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},

Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In the last two decades, technological advances have been spectacular,
   and their transcendence has touched all areas of society. Specifically,
   in the field of education, these advances have allowed projects and
   approaches such as computational thinking to be taken up more strongly
   through interdisciplinary visions such as the STEM subjects and
   technological devices such as Arduino. The main objective of this
   article is to analyse the uses of Arduino and the achievements it has
   attained at primary-education level. To this end, a systematic review
   was carried out in the SCOPUS and Web of Science databases. The
   methodology used was the PRISMA statement and the SALSA framework. In
   accordance with the exclusion criteria applied, nine scientific papers
   from the last seven years were obtained. The qualitative software
   ATLAS.ti was used to extract the results. These papers reveal that the
   most commonly used methodology for incorporating the Arduino board into
   teaching is problem based learning (PBL) in the context of STEM
   subjects. In addition, programming environments, such as Scratch, and
   other electronic components have been used, which have enabled the
   development of computational thinking and the acquisition of
   technological knowledge, among other achievements.},

   collaboration. By adopting a general three-tiered architecture based on
   common standards for portlets and Grid Web services, we can deliver
   numerous capabilities to science gateways from our diverse constituent

   portlets using the Velocity development environment. Our Grid portlets
   are based on abstraction layers provided by the Java CoG kit, which hide
   the differences of different Grid toolkits. Sophisticated services are
   decoupled from the portal container using Web service strategies. We

Abstract = {Historically, embedded systems development has been a specialist skill,
   requiring knowledge of low-level programming languages, complex
   compilation toolchains, and specialist hardware, firmware, device
   drivers and applications. However, it has now become commonplace for a
   broader range of non-specialists to engage in the making (design and
   development) of embedded systems - including educators to motivate and
   excite their students in the classroom. This diversity brings its own
   set of unique requirements, and the complexities of existing embedded
   systems development platforms introduce insurmountable barriers to
   entry.
   In this paper we present the motivation, requirements, implementation,
   and evaluation of a new programming platform that enables novice users
   to create effective and efficient software for embedded systems. The
   platform has two major components: (1) Microsoft MakeCode
   (www.makecode.com), a web app that encapsulates an accessible IDE for
   microcontrollers; and (2) CODAL, an efficient component-oriented C++
   runtime for microcontrollers. We show how MakeCode and CODAL combine to
   provide an accessible, cross-platform, installation-free, high level
   programming experience for embedded devices without sacrificing
   performance and efficiency.},

Abstract = {Server technology started with transaction-processing systems in the
   sixties. Database Management Systems (DBMS) soon adopted mechanism like
   multi-process and multi-threading. In distributed systems, the remote
   procedure call also needed process structures at the server side. The
   same is true for file servers, object servers (CORBA), Web servers,
   application servers, EJB containers, and Web Services. All these systems
   support a request-response behavior, sometimes enhanced with a session
   concept. They are facing thousands of requests per second and must
   manage thousands of session contexts at the same time. While programming
   the applications that run on the servers and actually process the
   requests should be as simple as possible, efficiency must still be very
   high. So a general programming environment should be defined that is
   easy to use and, on the other hand, allows for the efficient execution
   of thousands of program instances in parallel. This contribution will
   identify mechanisms that have been developed in the context of
   transaction processing and database management. It will then generalize
   them to server processing of any kind. This includes program structures,
   context management, multi-tasking and multi-threading, process
   structures, program management, naming, and transactions. The driving
   force behind the discussion is to avoid the re-invention of the wheel
   that far too often occurs in computer science, mostly in ignorance of
   older and presumably outdated systems.},

Journal = {MABS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {498-505},
Abstract = {Methionine oxidation is a common posttranslational modification (PTM) of
   monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Oxidation can reduce the in-vivo
   half-life, efficacy and stability of the product. Peptide mapping is
   commonly used to monitor the levels of oxidation, but this is a
   relatively time-consuming method. A high-throughput, automated subunit
   mass analysis method was developed to monitor antibody methionine
   oxidation. In this method, samples were treated with IdeS, EndoS and
   dithiothreitol to generate three individual IgG subunits (light chain,
   Fd' and single chain Fc). These subunits were analyzed by reversed
   phase-ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with an online
   quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer and the levels of oxidation
   on each subunit were quantitated based on the deconvoluted mass spectra
   using the UNIFI software. The oxidation results obtained by subunit mass
   analysis correlated well with the results obtained by peptide mapping.
   Method qualification demonstrated that this subunit method had excellent
   repeatability and intermediate precision. In addition, UNIFI software
   used in this application allows automated data acquisition and
   processing, which makes this method suitable for high-throughput process
   monitoring and product characterization. Finally, subunit mass analysis
   revealed the different patterns of Fc methionine oxidation induced by
   chemical and photo stress, which makes it attractive for investigating
   the root cause of oxidation.},

Abstract = {Location-based augmented reality technology for real-world, outdoor
   experiences is rapidly gaining in popularity in a variety of fields such
   as engineering, education, and gaming. By anchoring medias to geographic
   coordinates, it is possible to design immersive experiences remotely,
   without necessitating an in-depth knowledge of the context. However, the
   creation of such experiences typically requires complex programming
   tools that are beyond the reach of mainstream users. We introduce
   BiodivAR, a web cartographic tool for the authoring of location-based AR
   experiences. Developed using a user-centered design methodology and
   open-source interoperable web technologies, it is the second iteration
   of an effort that started in 2016. It is designed to meet needs defined
   through use cases co-designed with end users and enables the creation of
   custom geolocated points of interest. This approach enabled substantial
   progress over the previous iteration. Its reliance on geolocation data
   to anchor augmented objects relative to the user's position poses a set
   of challenges: On mobile devices, GNSS accuracy typically lies between 1
   m and 30 m. Due to its impact on the anchoring, this lack of accuracy
   can have deleterious effects on usability. We conducted a comparative
   user test using the application in combination with two different
   geolocation data types (GNSS versus RTK). While the test's results are
   undergoing analysis, we hereby present a methodology for the assessment
   of our system's usability based on the use of eye-tracking devices,
   geolocated traces and events, and usability questionnaires.},

Abstract = {Fault diagnosis has become increasingly important for industrial
   automation and many approaches have been investigated for the online
   diagnostic task. This work demonstrates a new online expert system for
   dynamic industrial automated processes. The emphasis of this diagnostic
   system lies in the functions provided for fault detection, prediction,
   compensation and diagnosis. The system uses experiential knowledge
   cooperatively with scientific knowledge in a new interactive formation.
   It is developed in two parts using the DASYLab software for the
   numerical computations and the KPWin development tool for the symbolic
   representations. The system was developed in collaboration with the
   company Automation Systems S.A., which specializes in hydraulic systems,
   and is used for fault detection in production machines.},

Abstract = {Since the vision of a Digital Earth (DE) was introduced in 1998,
   geo-browsers seem to have nearly fulfilled this vision. Virtual reality
   (VR) for visualizing the DE provides an immersive user experience in a
   mirror world. Location-based augmented reality (AR) browsers have been
   introduced and provide content according to user and environmental
   contexts. However, the content models of traditional geo-browsers and AR
   browsers have very limited interoperability, because they are described
   in application-specific formats using their domain standards. Each
   application is vertically integrated from content to application. The
   Web is an interoperable and open platform, and hundreds of millions of
   users are already using it to create and share content. To envision DE
   browsers for cross-reality (XR) environments that concurrently support
   geovisualization as well as VR, AR, and mixed-reality environments, we
   propose a DE content model based on Web standards and architecture that
   provides full interoperability and openness for XR browsers as a
   first-class citizen of the Web. This is expected to improve the DE
   content development efficiency by fully using the Web content
   development environment.},

Title = {SeqHound: biological sequence and structure database as a platform for
   bioinformatics research},
Journal = {BMC BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {Background: SeqHound has been developed as an integrated biological
   sequence, taxonomy, annotation and 3-D structure database system. It
   provides a high-performance server platform for bioinformatics research
   in a locally-hosted environment.
   Results: SeqHound is based on the National Center for Biotechnology
   Information data model and programming tools. It offers daily updated
   contents of all Entrez sequence databases in addition to 3-D structural
   data and information about sequence redundancies, sequence neighbours,
   taxonomy, complete genomes, functional annotation including Gene
   Ontology terms and literature links to PubMed. SeqHound is accessible
   via a web server through a Perl, C or C++ remote API or an optimized
   local API. It provides functionality necessary to retrieve specialized
   subsets of sequences, structures and structural domains. Sequences may
   be retrieved in FASTA, GenBank, ASN.I and XML formats. Structures are
   available in ASN.I, XML and PDB formats. Emphasis has been placed on
   complete genomes, taxonomy, domain and functional annotation as well as
   3-D structural functionality in the API, while fielded text indexing
   functionality remains under development. SeqHound also offers a
   streamlined WWW interface for simple web-user queries.
   Conclusions: The system has proven useful in several published
   bioinformatics projects such as the BIND database and offers a
   cost-effective infrastructure for research. SeqHound will continue to
   develop and be provided as a service of the Blueprint Initiative at the
   Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute. The source code and examples are
   available under the terms of the GNU public license at the Sourceforge
   site http://sourceforge.net/projects/slritools/ in the SLRI Toolkit.},

Abstract = {Scientific research is becoming increasingly dependent on the
   large-scale analysis of data using distributed computing infrastructures
   (Grid, cloud, GPU, etc.). Scientific computing (Petitet et al. 1999)
   aims at constructing mathematical models and numerical solution

   this paper, we describe the services of an integrated portal based on
   the P-Grade (Parallel Grid Run-time and Application Development
   Environment) portal (http://www.p-grade.hu) that enables the solution of
   large-scale linear systems of equations using direct solvers, makes
   easier the use of parallel block iterative algorithm and provides an
   interface for parallel decision making algorithms. The ultimate goal is
   to develop a single sign on integrated multi-service environment
   providing an easy access to different kind of mathematical calculations
   and algorithms to be performed on hybrid distributed computing
   infrastructures combining the benefits of large clusters, Grid or cloud,

Volume = {174},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Aimed at exchanging the dissimilar data between distributed
   applications, web services (WSs) annotations have progressed as a
   versatile and cost-effectual solution. Information retrieval (IR)assists
   in establishing the user -essential related information's searching
   impacts. However, rendering quick and efficient IR is a challenging
   problem. Also, the existent system yields slow accuracy, and as well the
   training time is high. Aimed at over-coming these problems, implemented
   an effective WS annotation aimed at domain classification and IR systems
   utilizing the Hybrid Artificial Deep Learning Neural Network (HADLNN).
   Firstly, the Semantic annotation (SA) stage is executed that comprises
   text preprocessing, repetitive data removal, feature extraction, and as
   well Ontology Construction. The text preprocessing offers the
   partitioning, stop word removal, and as well the stemming procedure
   aimed at the WSDL dataset. Next, continual WSs utilizing Hadoop
   Distributed File System (HDFS)is eliminated. After that, the CFC,
   confidence, support, and as well entropy attributes are taken out;next,
   the (Web Ontology Language) OWL files as of ontology construction are
   generated utilizing the prote ` ge ` tool. After producing the OWL, the
   owl file is visualized utilizing Eclipse IDE and extracted the values
   utilizing the reasoner in the protege tool. After WS annotations, the
   domain is categorized centered on the connecting of WSs utilizing
   HADLNN. Lastly, the IR procedure is executed on MK-means that groups
   identical services as of the categorized domain. Preliminary outcomes
   exhibit that the system proposed offers efficient performance

Abstract = {An approach is presented to improve engineering education that is based

   of appropriate levels of abstraction, has provided better understanding
   of the system used to pro,ide engineering education and a basis for
   quantitatively linking components of the program to student performance
   in a causal manner. The educational system performance model is
   discussed in the context of competency models. It is believed that this

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is increasingly
   recognized as a distinct clinical entity and is associated with a high
   short-term mortality. The most common cause of ACLF is chronic hepatitis
   B worldwide. Currently, there is no standardized approach for the
   management of ACLF and the efficacy and safety of therapeutic modalities
   are uncertain.
   DATA SOURCES: Pub Med and Web of Science were searched for
   English-language articles. The search criteria focused on clinical
   trials and observational studies on the treatment of patients with
   HBV-related ACLF.
   RESULTS: Therapeutic approaches for ACLF in patients with chronic
   hepatitis B included nudeos(t)ide analogues, artificial liver support
   systems, immune regulatory therapy, stem cell therapy and liver
   transplantation. All of these therapeutic approaches have shown the
   potential to improve liver function and increase patients' survival
   rate, but most of the studies were not randomized or controlled.
   CONCLUSION: Substantial challenges for the treatment of HBV-related ACLF
   remain and further basic research and randomized controlled clinical
   trials are needed.},

   the rapid growth of environmental information. This paper presents a
   prototype Environmental Management Information System (EMIS) that was
   developed to provide a systematic way of managing environmental data and
   human resources of an environmental organization. The system was
   designed using programming languages, a Database Management System
   (DBMS) and other technologies and programming tools and combines
   information from the relational database in order to achieve the
   principal goals of the environmental organization. The developed
   application can be used to store and elaborate information regarding:
   human resources data, environmental projects, observations, reports,
   data about the protected species, environmental measurements of
   pollutant factors or other kinds of analytical measurements and also the
   financial data of the organization. Furthermore, the system supports the
   visualization of spatial data structures by using geographic information
   systems (GIS) and web mapping technologies. This paper describes this

Abstract = {All smart services in cloud computing platforms have a data-sharing

   implemented to provide efficient and secure data transmission channel.
   However, it has been suffered with a number of issues because of several

   overcome this issue, a novel Double-Stage Secret (DSS) cryptosystem is
   proposed to prevent the attacks in the communication channel, here the
   encryption and decryption function is processed based on some specific
   condition. If the DSS condition is satisfied then the client or user is
   requested to decrypt the message. To validate the secure and success
   rate of the proposed model, an efficient novel back sniff is developed
   and launched in the data transmission channel and its secure range is
   evaluated. In addition, the simulation of this research is done by Java,
   running on net beans IDE 8.2 in windows 10 platform and the results
   illustrated that the proposed model has attained high performance by
   gaining a high secure rate and less processing time of encryption and

Abstract = {Purpose: This paper reports on the development of a tool for searching
   the contents of licensed full-text electronic book (e-book) collections.
   Setting: The Health Sciences Library System (HSLS) provides services to
   the University of Pittsburgh's medical programs and large academic
   health system.
   Brief Description: The HSLS has developed an innovative tool for
   federated searching of its e-book collections. Built using the XML-based
   Vivisimo development environment, the tool enables a user to perform a
   full-text search of over 2,500 titles from the library's seven most
   highly used e-book collections. From a single ``Google-style{''} query,
   results are returned as an integrated set of links pointing directly to
   relevant sections of the full text. Results are also grouped into
   categories that enable more precise retrieval without reformulation of
   the search.
   Results/Evaluation: A heuristic evaluation demonstrated the usability of
   the tool and a web server log analysis indicated an acceptable level of
   usage. Based on its success, there are plans to increase the number of
   online book collections searched.
   Conclusion: This library's first foray into federated searching has
   produced an effective tool for searching across large collections of
   full-text e-books and has provided a good foundation for the development
   of other library-based federated searching products.},

Abstract = {Many researches about e-learning system have been applied item
   difficulty to increase learning effectiveness. And development
   environment was changed the internet based learning media contents into
   the more various technology such as component, web 2.0, service oriented
   development and so on. Especially, service-oriented development is one
   of new trend in web based system and has become mainstream in software
   development. In the development, web components aims at providing
   support to service-oriented technique by enabling automatic discovery,
   composition, invocation and interoperation of the services. In this
   paper, we aimed the implementation of English e-learning system
   including the item guessing parameter and considering the relative
   correction of item difficulty. In the system, a learner was given to
   choose the learning step by the relative difficulty. In order to process
   and combine, all the learning contents are based on Sharable Content
   Object Reference Model (SCORM) with Learning Management System (LMS).
   Also, each learning contents are belong to Sharable Content Objects

Abstract = {Traits have been designed as units for fine-grained reuse of behavior in
   the object-oriented paradigm. Records have been devised to complement
   traits for fine-grained reuse of state. In this paper, we present the
   language TRAITRECORDJ, a JAVA dialect with records and traits. Records
   and traits can be composed by explicit linguistic operations, allowing
   code manipulations to achieve fine-grained code reuse. Classes are
   assembled from (composite) records and traits and instantiated to
   generate objects. We introduce the language through examples and
   illustrate the prototypical implementation of TRAITRECORDJ using XTEXT,
   an Eclipse framework for the development of programming languages as
   well as other domain-specific languages. Our implementation comprises an
   Eclipse-based editor for TRAITRECORDJ with typical IDE functionalities,
   and a stand-alone compiler, which translates TRAITRECORDJ programs into
   standard JAVA programs. As a case study, we present the TRAITRECORDJ
   implementation of a part of the software used in a web-based information
   system previously implemented in JAVA. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-HUMAN INTERACTION},
Year = {2011},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Recent discussions in the interaction design community have called
   attention to sketching as an omnipresent element of any disciplined
   activity of design, and have pointed out that sketching should be
   extended beyond the simple creation of a pencil trace on paper. More
   specifically, the need to deal with all attributes of a user experience,
   especially the timing, phrasing, and feel of the interaction, has been
   identified. In this article, we propose extending the concept of
   sketching with a pencil on paper to the more generic concept of fluent
   exploration of interactive materials. We define interactive materials as
   any piece of software or hardware that represents or simulates a part of
   the interactive user experience, such as input from sensors, output in
   the form of sound, video, or image, or interaction with Web services or
   specialized programs. We have implemented the proposed concept within
   Sketchify, a tool for sketching user interfaces. Sketchify gives
   designers the freedom to manipulate interactive materials by combining
   elements of traditional freehand sketching with functional extensions
   and end-user programming tools, such as spreadsheets and scripting. We
   have evaluated Sketchify in the education of interaction designers,
   identifying both successful aspects and aspects that need further
   improvements.},

Title = {Application Of AFFDE-RBF-PID-PI Cascade Control In Heating Furnace
   Temperature Control System},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {27},
Number = {7},
Pages = {2767-2775},
Abstract = {Given the large hysteresis in the material outlet temperature of the
   heating furnace, a differential evolution algorithm with adaptive
   adjustment factors (AAFDE)-radial basis function (RBF)-proportional
   integral derivative (PID)-PI cascade is proposed. First, we introduce an
   adaptive mutation factor into the differential evolution (DE) algorithm
   and define the individual merit coefficient to incorporate a
   self-adaptive crossover probability factor. Second, the initial
   parameters of RBF are optimized by the AFFDE algorithm, and RBF neural
   network model is established. Then, we obtain gradient information by
   RBF online identification. Finally, we perform online adjustments to the
   three parameters of PID based on the gradient information. The three
   parameters are applied to the adjustment of the main controller, while
   the sub-controller employs PI control. Experimental results show that
   the anti-disturbance performance of the AFFDE-RBF-PID-PI cascade control
   outperforms the improved differential evolution (IDE)-RBF-PID-PI cascade
   control, generalized opposition-based differential evolution
   (GODE)-RBF-PID-PI cascade control, and MCOBDE-RBF-PID-PI cascade control
   respectively by 16\%, 11\%, and 7\%, with the response speed improving
   by 18\%, 12\%, and 9\%, and the stability improving by 19\%, 13\%, and
   8\%. These results show that AFFDE-RBF-PID-PI cascade control exhibits
   enhanced anti-disturbance performance, faster response speed, improved
   stability, and superior control effect.},

Title = {Deep Learning for Clothing Style Recognition Using YOLOv5},
Journal = {MICROMACHINES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, much more
   attention has been paid to deep learning. However, as the complexity of
   learning algorithms increases, the needs of computation power of
   hardware facilities become more crucial. Instead of the focus being on
   computing devices like GPU computers, a lightweight learning algorithm
   could be the answer for this problem. Cross-domain applications of deep
   learning have attracted great interest amongst researchers in academia
   and industries. For beginners who do not have enough support with
   software and hardware, an open-source development environment is very
   helpful. In this paper, a relatively lightweight algorithm YOLOv5s is
   addressed, and the Google Colab is used for model training and testing.
   Based on the developed environment, many state-of-art learning
   algorithms can be studied for performance comparisons. To highlight the
   benefits of one-stage object detection algorithms, the recognition of
   clothing styles is investigated. The image samples are selected from
   datasets of fashion clothes and the web crawling of online stores. The
   image data are categorized into five groups: plaid; plain; block;
   horizontal; and vertical. Average precison, mean average precison,
   recall, F1-score, model size, and frame per second are the metrics used
   for performance validations. From the experimental outcomes, it shows
   that YOLOv5s is better than other learning algorithms in the recognition
   accuracy and detection speed.},

Abstract = {Numerical guidance methods for decision making support of aviation
   meteorological forecasters a-re presented. The methods have been
   developed to enhance the usefulness of numerical weather prediction
   (NWP) model data and local and upstream observations in the production
   of terminal aerodrome forecasts (TAFs) and trend-type forecasts (TRENDs)
   for airports. In this paper two newly developed methods are described
   and it is shown how they are used to derive numerical guidance products
   for aviation. The first is a combination of statistical and physical
   postprocessing of NWP model data and in situ observations. This method
   is used to derive forecasts for all aviation-related meteorological
   parameters at the airport. The second is a high-resolution wind
   transformation method. a technique used to derive local wind at airports
   from grid-box-averaged NWP model winds.
   For operational use of the numerical guidance products encoding software
   is provided for automatic production of an alphanumeric TA-F and TREND
   code. A graphical user interface,with an integrated code editor enables
   the forecaster to modify the suggested automatic codes. For aviation,
   the most important parameters in the numerical guidance are visibility
   and cloud-base height. Both have been subjected to a,statistical
   verification analysis. together with their automatically produced codes.
   The results in terms of skill score are compared to the skill of the
   forecasters' TAT and TREND code. The statistical measures suggest that
   the guidance has the best skill at lead times of +4 h and more. For the
   short term, mainly trend-type forecasts, the persistence forecast based
   on recent observations is difficult to beat. Verification has also shown
   that the wind transformation method. which has been applied to generate
   10-m winds at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, reduces the mean error in the
   (grid box averaged.) NWP model wind significantly.
   Among the potential benefits of these numerical guidance methods is
   increasing forecast accuracy. As a result. the related numerical
   guidance products and encoding software have been integrated in the
   operational environment for the production of TA.Fs and TRENDs.},

Abstract = {Component-based development (CBD) has become an important emerging topic
   in the software engineering field. It promises long-sought-after
   benefits such as increased software reuse, reduced development time to
   market and, hence, reduced software production cost. Despite the huge
   potential, the lack of reasoning support and development environment of
   component modeling and verification may hinder its development. Methods
   and tools that can support component model analysis are highly
   appreciated by industry. Such a tool support should be fully automated
   as well as efficient. At the same time, the reasoning tool should scale
   LIP well as it may need to handle hundreds or even thousands of
   components that a modern software system may have. Furthermore, a
   distributed environment that can effectively manage and compose
   components is also desirable. In this paper, we present an approach to
   the modeling and verification of a newly proposed component model using
   Semantic Web languages and their reasoning tools. We use the Web
   Ontology Language and the Semantic Web Rule Language to precisely
   capture the inter-relationships and constraints among the entities in a
   component model. Semantic Web reasoning tools are deployed to perform
   automated analysis support of the component models. Moreover, we also
   proposed a service-oriented architecture (SOA)-based semantic web
   environment for CBD. The adoption of Semantic Web services and SOA make
   our component environment more reusable, scalable, dynamic and adaptive.},

Journal = {INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {104},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Context: Model-driven development approaches facilitate the production
   of Web applications. Among them, the Object-Oriented Hypermedia method
   (OO-H) has been successfully used for the development of industrial Web
   applications. Similarly to other development approaches, it is important
   also in this context to put measures in place to support project
   managers in resource allocation, cost and schedule control, and
   productivity monitoring.
   Objective. This motivated us to define a measurement procedure, named
   OO-HCFP, specifically conceived for OO-H Web applications based on
   COSMIC, a second-generation functional size measurement method.
   Method. We present mapping and measurement rules devised to
   automatically derive size measures from OO-H models. We also carry out
   an empirical study to evaluate whether our proposed measurement
   procedure, OO-HCFP, is useful for estimating the effort needed to
   realise industrial Web applications developed with OO-H.
   Results. The estimates obtained by using OO-HCFP are more accurate than
   those obtained by using other measurement approaches based on Function
   Points and design measures.
   Conclusions. The proposed approach can be profitably exploited to size
   Web applications developed with OO-H. Based on our experience, we also
   provide some guidelines to support the formulation of COSMIC measurement
   procedures for other model-driven approaches.},

Abstract = {In 1999, the 1451.1 Standard, which defines a common object model and
   interface specification to develop open multivendor distributed
   measurement and control systems, was published. However, despite the
   well-known advantages of the model, there have been a few initiatives to
   implement a commercial version of the standard. In this paper, we
   describe the implementation of a Network Capable Application Processor
   (NCAP) in a well-known and well-proven infrastructure, i.e., the
   Microsoft .NET Framework. The use of a commercial framework increases
   productivity because it handles low-level programming details and
   provides good development tools, which allows us to produce a reusable
   and robust code. In addition, a solution to enhance the 1451.1 Standard
   is presented by proposing a new format for inter-NCAP communication
   based on eXtended Markup Language (XML) Web Services. This approach
   promotes interoperability because any device with a compatible Web
   Service middleware can locate and communicate with our prototype.},

Journal = {COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Pages = {520-536},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Programming-related courses prefer to put importance on practice rather
   than theoretical knowledge. However, the students' programming behavior
   data is difficult to be recorded and fed back to teachers anytime,
   allowing teachers to adjust their teaching in real-time. Aiming at this
   problem, this study develops an online integrated programming platform
   that provides a unified programming environment for teachers and
   students and logs students' procedural programming behavior data
   automatically to assist teachers in providing real-time feedback
   teaching. To verify the effectiveness of the data-driven immediate
   feedback teaching method, an exploratory case was conducted in the
   2020/2021 academic year autumn semester. As the control group, cloud201
   adopted the traditional hybrid online/offline mode, while cloud202, as
   the experimental group, adopted the hybrid online/offline mode and
   immediate feedback teaching mode. The effect is demonstrated through the
   questionnaire, the programming behavior data analysis, and the
   performance analysis. The results of the questionnaire show that there
   are significant differences in the students' satisfaction with
   interaction, supervision, feedback, and evaluation, of which feedback is
   the biggest part. In addition, the two analysis results indicate that
   students' individual learning development and the learning status of the
   class are objectively characterized, the overall grade distribution of
   cloud202 is more concentrated in medium grades and the difference on
   average scores between cloud201 and cloud202 is gradually increased.
   Since the students' immediate and comprehensive programming behavior
   data is perceived by teachers, the teaching adjustment is so flexible
   that the improvement of teaching efficiency and teaching effect is
   promoted accordingly.},

Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Pages = {99-104},
Abstract = {Genome-scale studies of the bacterial regulatory network have been
   leveraged by declining sequencing cost and advances in ChIP (chromatin
   immunoprecipitation) methods. Of which, ChIP-exo has proven competent
   with its near-single base-pair resolution. While several algorithms and
   programs have been developed for different analytical steps in ChIP-exo
   data processing, there is a lack of effort in incorporat-ing them into a
   convenient bioinformatics pipeline that is intuitive and publicly
   available. In this paper, we developed ChIP-exo Analysis Pipeline
   (ChEAP) that executes the one-step process, starting from trim-ming and
   aligning raw sequencing reads to visualization of ChIP-exo results. The
   pipeline was imple-mented on the interactive web-based Python
   development environment - Jupyter Notebook, which is compatible with the
   Google Colab cloud platform to facilitate the sharing of codes and
   collaboration among researchers. Additionally, users could exploit the
   free GPU and CPU resources allocated by Colab to carry out computing
   tasks regardless of the performance of their local machines. The utility
   of ChEAP was demonstrated with the ChIP-exo datasets of RpoN sigma
   factor in E. coli K-12 MG1655. To analyze two raw data files, ChEAP
   runtime was 2 min and 25 s. Subsequent analyses identified 113 RpoN
   binding sites showing a conserved RpoN binding pattern in the motif
   search. ChEAP application in ChIP-exo data analysis is extensive and
   flexible for the parallel processing of data from various organisms. (c)

Title = {Expanded Neo-Fuzzy Adaptive Decayed Brain Emotional Learning Network for
   Online Time Series Predication},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {65758-65770},
Abstract = {The Neo-Fuzzy integrated Adaptive Decayed Brain Emotional Learning
   (NF-ADBEL) network has recently been proposed for online time series
   predicting problems. The NF-ADBEL network is suitable for online time
   series prediction with shorter update intervals and offers features such
   as fast learning, accuracy, simplicity, and lower computational
   complexity. However, the neo-fuzzy neuron network in NF-ADBEL was
   integrated only in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) part of the ADBEL
   network. This paper aims to further improve the performance of the
   NF-ADBEL network by integrating the neo-fuzzy neuron network into the
   amygdala (AMY) section as well, inspired by a fully integrated version
   of a neo-fuzzy-based pattern recognizer. As is known, the AMY has two
   outputs: one response is based on imprecise information received from
   the thalamus, and the second response is based on information received
   from the sensory cortex. In this study, the imprecise response
   generation is operated as previously, while the other AMY process is
   treated by neo-fuzzy neurons. The resultant network is called Expanded
   Neo-Fuzzy integrated Adaptive Decayed Brain Emotional Learning
   (ENF-ADBEL). The modified network is still simple and meets the
   requirement for online prediction problems. A few chaotic and stochastic
   nonlinear systems, namely the Mackey-Glass, Lorenz, Rossler, disturbance
   storm time index, Narendra dynamic plant identification, wind speed and
   wind power series, are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed
   network in terms of the root mean squared error (RMSE) and correlation
   coefficient (COR) criteria in a MATLAB programming environment.},

Abstract = {In order to assess the importance of political communication in the
   Mexican political culture, this paper probes into the behavior of
   digital communities in Twitter during the 2018 Mexico's presidential
   election.
   Research followed a two staged design. First, a large sample of tweets
   were collected on a daily basis using the package ``rtweet{''} in the R
   programming environment. Following that, the collected tweets were
   filtered, cleaned, and a codebook was designed to analyze their
   contents.
   The results show that, out of a sample of 4664 publications, candidate
   Jose Antonio Meade had the largest number of mentions (47\%), followed
   by Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (29\%) and Ricardo Anaya (24\%). ``Common
   citizens{''} issued 31\% of the tweets analyzed, out of which 20\% show
   links to online news outlets, while journalists and media publications
   accounted for 40\% of the sampled tweets. The authors consider that
   these results characterize the observed digital communication practices
   as either transformations or extensions of the offline public sphere.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the development of task-specific information
   retrieval systems for software engineers. We discuss how software
   engineers interact with information and information retrieval systems
   and investigate to what extent a domain-specific search and
   recommendation system can be developed in order to support their work
   related activities. We have conducted a user study which is based on the
   ``Cognitive Research Framework{''} to identify the relation between the
   information objects used during the code development (code snippets and
   search queries), the tasks users engage in and the associated use of
   search interfaces. Based on our user studies, a questionnaire and an
   automated observation of user interactions with the browser and software
   development environment, we identify that software engineers engage in a
   finite number of work related tasks and they also develop a finite
   number of ``work practices{''}/{''}archetypes of behaviour{''}. Secondly
   we identify a group of domain specific behaviours that can successfully
   be used as a source of strong implicit relevance feedback. Based on our
   results, we design a snippet recommendation interface, and a code
   related recommendation interface which are embedded within the standard
   search engine. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Translation, cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Diabetes
   Empowerment Scale - Short Form},
Journal = {REVISTA DE SAUDE PUBLICA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {51},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To translate, cross-culturally adapt and validate the
   Diabetes Empowerment Scale - Short Form for assessment of psychosocial
   self-efficacy in diabetes care within the Brazilian cultural context.
   METHODS: Assessment of the instrument's conceptual equivalence, as well
   as its translation and cross-cultural adaptation were performed
   following international standards. The Expert Committee's assessment of
   the translated version was conducted through a web questionnaire
   developed and applied via the web tool e-Surv. The cross-culturally
   adapted version was used for the pre-test, which was carried out via
   phone call in a group of eleven health care service users diagnosed with
   type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pre-test results were examined by a group
   of experts, composed by health care consultants, applied linguists and
   statisticians, aiming at an adequate version of the instrument, which
   was subsequently used for test and retest in a sample of 100 users
   diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus via phone call, their answers
   being recorded by the web tool e-Surv. Internal consistency and
   reproducibility of analysis were carried out within the statistical
   programming environment R.
   RESULTS: Face and content validity were attained and the Brazilian
   Portuguese version, entitled Escala de Autoeficacia em Diabetes - Versao
   Curta, was established. The scale had acceptable internal consistency
   with Cronbach's alpha of 0.634 (95\% CI 0.494-0.737), while the
   correlation of the total score in the two periods was considered
   moderate (0.47). The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.50.
   CONCLUSIONS: The translated and cross-culturally adapted version of the
   instrument to spoken Brazilian Portuguese was considered valid and
   reliable to be used for assessment within the Brazilian population
   diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The use of a web tool (e-Surv)
   for recording the Expert Committee responses as well as the responses in
   the validation tests proved to be a reliable, safe and innovative
   method.},

Abstract = {In response to the challenges introduced by global warming and increased
   eutrophication, this paper presents an innovative modeling and
   simulation (M\&S)-driven model for developing an automated inland water
   monitoring system. This system is grounded in a layered Internet of
   Things (IoT) architecture and seamlessly integrates cloud, fog, and edge
   computing to enable sophisticated, real-time environmental surveillance
   and prediction of harmful algal and cyanobacterial blooms (HACBs).
   Utilizing autonomous boats as mobile data collection units within the
   edge layer, the system efficiently tracks algae and cyanobacteria
   proliferation and relays critical data upward through the architecture.
   These data feed into advanced inference models within the cloud layer,
   which inform predictive algorithms in the fog layer, orchestrating
   subsequent data-gathering missions. This paper also details a complete
   development environment that facilitates the system lifecycle from
   concept to deployment. The modular design is powered by Discrete Event
   System Specification (DEVS) and offers unparalleled adaptability,
   allowing developers to simulate, validate, and deploy modules
   incrementally and cutting across traditional developmental phases.},

Abstract = {As a virtual machine is a software emulation to provide a logical
   environment without hardware dependency, it is a key technology for
   cloud, mobile and IoT computing and one of major technologies to offer
   better IT service in the information and knowledge-based society. Smart
   Virtual Machine (SVM) is a core module of a smart cross platform that
   provides users with language-platform independent functions for a higher
   level of contents reusability. This is a software processor executable
   with the medium code named SIL as the stack basis. This study introduces
   a way of multi-thread embodiment in which SVM can execute multiple
   tasks. The multi thread for SVM was designed based on a thread model of
   C++ and Java Language. Since it supports C/C++ and Java programming
   environments, SVM processes various tasks simultaneously with a higher
   level of program concurrency.
   This study focuses on a thread for Smart Virtual Machine. As a virtual
   machine-based compiler generates a program created by means of C/C++ or
   Java and the semantically equivalent intermediate code, SVM receives and
   executes them. The thread for SVM was designed based on a thread model
   of C++/Java, thread scheduling is possible for multithreading in
   programming. A programmer may use the thread regardless of the
   developing language, and it is executable with no limitation due to
   certain hardware types. Besides, the thread enhances program
   concurrency.},

Abstract = {This article explores online parental mediation strategies in Spain and
   their association with sociodemographic and family context Factors. The
   results of a survey conducted at the end of 2018 are presented herein,
   based on a sample of 2,900 Spanish minors between 9 and 17 years of age
   who use Internet. The impact of the diverse parental mediation
   strategies applied to Internet use has been calculated by taking into
   account the sociodemographic Factor's ofthe participating minors (age
   and gender). Association analysis was performed using the SPSS
   statistical analysis programme. In this case, an extra analysis was
   carried out with regard to the relationship of influence between
   different strategies and the rules of behaviour and family support in
   the household context as perceived by the minor Findings suggest that
   enabling and restrictive mediation strategies are very common in Spanish
   families, while technical mediation strategies have a very limited
   presence. It is noteworthy that restrictions and security strategies
   generally apply more to girls than to boys. Household Ides related to
   the behaviour of minors have a positive correlation with an increase of
   influence of nearly all strategies. However; there is no relevant
   association between family support perceived by children and restrictive
   strategies and techniques applied by parents.},

Abstract = {The development of Internet of Things, fueled by cloud computing and big
   data processing from upper level, and by ubiquitous sensory and actuator
   devices from the lower level, has taken a sharp turn towards integrating
   the entire information, computing, communication, and control systems.
   This special issue selected seven papers from the 2015 IEEE twelfth
   International Symposium on Autonomous Decentralized Systems (ISADS).
   These papers cover the latest research on IoT and ADS based system
   science and system engineering methods; the wearable sensor network
   development and applications; and data analysis for security and
   reliability in IoT and ADS applications. As an addition to these
   selected topics, this guest editorial paper also adds IoT education and
   dissemination aspects to this special issue. As the IoT research and
   applications expand explosively into all the domains, schools and
   universities must prepare students to understand and to be able to
   program the IoT devices. This paper presents a visual programming
   environment that allows students without programming background to learn
   the key concepts of computing and IoT devices, and to program IoT

Abstract = {In a problem solving environment for geometric computing, a graphical
   user interface, or GUI, for visualization has become an essential
   component for geometric software development. In this paper we describe
   a visualization system, called GeoJAVA, which consists of a GUI and a
   geometric visualization library that enables the user or algorithm
   designer to (1) execute and visualize an existing algorithm in the
   library or (2) develop new code over the Internet. The library consists
   of geometric code written in C/C++. The GUI is written using the Java
   programming language. Taking advantage of the socket classes and
   system-independent application programming interfaces (API's) provided
   with the Java language, GeoJAVA offers a platform independent
   environment for distributed geometric computing that combines Java and
   C/C++ Users may remotely join a `channel{''} or discussion group in a
   location transparent manner to do collaborative research. The
   visualization of an algorithm, a C/C++ program located locally or
   remotely and controlled by a ``floor manager,{''} can be viewed by all
   the members in the channel through a visualization sheet called
   GeoJAVASheet. A chat box is also provided to enable dialogue among the
   members. Furthermore, this system not only allows visualization of
   pre-compiled geometric code, but also serves as a web-based programming
   environment where the user may submit a geometric code, compile it with
   the libraries provided by the system, and visualize it directly over the
   web sharing it with other users immediately.},

Abstract = {The identification of social media communities has recently been of
   major concern, since users participating in such communities can
   contribute to viral marketing campaigns. In this work, we focus on
   users' communication considering personality as a key characteristic for
   identifying communicative networks i.e., networks with high information
   flows. We describe the Twitter Personality based Communicative
   Communities Extraction (T-PCCE) system that identifies the most
   communicative communities in a Twitter network graph considering users'
   personality. We then expand existing approaches in users' personality
   extraction by aggregating data that represent several aspects of user
   behavior using machine learning techniques. We use an existing
   modularity based community detection algorithm and we extend it by
   inserting a post-processing step that eliminates graph edges based on
   users' personality. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by
   sampling the Twitter graph and comparing the communication strength of
   the extracted communities with and without considering the personality
   factor. We define several metrics to count the strength of communication
   within each community. Our algorithmic framework and the subsequent
   implementation employ the cloud infrastructure and use the MapReduce
   Programming Environment. Our results show that the T-PCCE system creates
   the most communicative communities.},

Abstract = {Salmon farming in Chile constitutes one of the nation's principal food
   exporting sectors. In the seawater stage, one of the most important in
   the farm production chain, salmon are cultivated in floating cages
   fitted with nets that hold the fish during the entire grow-out process.
   The maintenance of the cage nets is carried out at land-based
   facilities. This article reports on the creation of an integer
   programming tool for grow-out centres that optimizes resource use,
   improves planning and generates economic evaluations for supporting
   analysis and decision-making relating to the maintenance, repair and
   periodic changing of cage nets. The tool prototype was tested in a
   single operating area of one of Chile's largest salmon farmers. The
   results demonstrated a reduction in net maintenance costs of almost
   18\%, plus a series of important qualitative benefits. Implementation of
   the tool by farm operators awaits the end of the current crisis in the
   industry. Journal of the Operational Research Society (2013) 64,

Title = {An Approach to Develop Digital Twins in Industry},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The industry is currently undergoing a digital revolution driven by the
   integration of several enabling technologies. These include automation,
   robotics, cloud computing, industrial cybersecurity, systems
   integration, digital twins, etc. Of particular note is the increasing
   use of digital twins, which offer significant added value by providing
   realistic and fully functional process simulations. This paper proposes
   an approach for developing digital twins in industrial environments. The
   novelty lies in not only focusing on obtaining the model of the
   industrial system and integrating virtual reality and/or augmented
   reality but also in emphasizing the importance of incorporating other
   enabled technologies of Industry 4.0, such as system integration,
   connectivity with standard and specific industrial protocols, cloud
   services, or new industrial automation systems, to enhance the
   capabilities of the digital twin. Furthermore, a proposal of the
   software tools that can be used to achieve this incorporation is made.
   Unity is chosen as the real-time 3D development tool for its
   cross-platform capability and streamlined industrial system modeling.
   The integration of augmented reality is facilitated by the Vuforia SDK.
   Node-RED is selected as the system integration option, and
   communications are carried out with MQTT protocol. Finally, cloud-based
   services are recommended for effective data storage and processing.
   Furthermore, this approach has been used to develop a digital twin of a
   robotic electro-pneumatic cell.},

Abstract = {The Compound Term Composition Algebra (CTCA) is an algebra with four
   algebraic operators, which can be used to generate the valid
   (meaningful) compound terms of a given faceted taxonomy, in an efficient
   and flexible manner. The positive operations allow the derivation of
   valid compound terms through the declaration of a small set of valid
   compound terms. The negative operations allow the derivation of valid
   compound terms through the declaration of a small set of invalid
   compound terms. In this paper, we show how CTCA can be represented in
   logic programming with negation-as-failure, according to both Clark's
   and well-founded semantics. Indeed, the SLDNF-resolution can be used for
   checking compound term validity and well-formedness of an algebraic
   expression in polynomial time w.r.t. the size of the expression and the
   number of terms in the taxonomy. This result makes our logic programming
   representation a competitive alternative to imperative algorithms.
   Embedding of our logic programming representation to the programming
   environment of a web portal for a computer sales company is
   demonstrated.},

Abstract = {Monitoring of nanoparticles (NPs) in air and aquatic environments is an
   unmet challenge accentuated by the rising exposure to anthropogenic or
   engineered NPs. The inherent heterogeneity in size, shape, and the
   stabilizing shell of NPs makes their selective recognition a daunting
   task. Thus far, only a few technologies have shown promise in detecting
   NPs; however, they are cumbersome, costly, and insensitive to the NPs
   morphology or composition. Herein, we apply an approach termed
   nanoparticle-imprinted matrices (NAIM), which is based on creating voids
   in a thin layer by imprinting NPs followed by their removal. The NAIM
   was formed on an interdigitated electrode (IDE) and used for the
   size-selective detection of silica NPs. Three- and 5-fold increases in
   capacitance were observed for the reuptake of NPs with similar diameter,
   compared to smaller or larger NPs, in air and liquid phase,
   respectively. En masse, the proposed approach lays the foundation for
   the emergence of field-effective, inexpensive, real-life applicable
   sensors that will allow online monitoring of NPs in air and liquids.},

Title = {Efficacy and resistance in de novo combination lamivudine and adefovir
   dipivoxil therapy versus entecavir monotherapy for the treatment-naive
   patients with chronic hepatitis B: a meta-analysis},
Journal = {VIROLOGY JOURNAL},
Year = {2014},

Month = {MAR 28},
Abstract = {Background: Currently, there is no consensus on the efficacy and
   resistance of de novo combination therapy versus monotherapy for
   treatment naive patients of chronic hepatitis B (CHB).
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and
   resistance of de novo combination of lamivudine (LAM) and adefovir
   dipivoxil (ADV) compared with entecavir (ETV) monotherapy for
   nucleos(t)ide-naive patients with CHB.
   Study design: Publications on the effectiveness and resistance of LAM
   plus ADV versus ETV monotherapy for nucleos(t) ide-naive patients with
   CHB were identified by a search of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library,
   Web of science, OVID, and CBM (Chinese Biological Medical Literature)
   until May 1, 2013. Biochemical response, hepatitis B e antigen
   seroconversion, and viroligic response were extracted and combined to
   obtain an integrated result. Viral resistance and safety were reviewed.
   Results: Five eligible studies (328 patients in total) were included in
   the analysis. LAM plus ADV combination therapy produced more rapid HBV
   DNA reduction rate at 12 weeks than that of ETV monotherapy. At 48
   weeks, the combination group had superior viroligic response rates
   compared with ETV group (90.0\% vs. 78.9\%, P=0.01). The difference in
   the ALT normalization and HBeAg seroconversion rates was not found. At
   week 96, LAM + ADV was more effective than ETV in ALT normalization
   {[}RR = 1. 11, 95\% CI (1.02, 1.21), P = 0.01] and HBeAg seroconversion
   {[}RR = 2.00, 95\% CI (1.26, 3.18, P=0.003)], and no significant
   difference was found in the virologic response (P = 0.23). No viral
   resistance occurred in combination therapy and six patients in ETV group
   were experienced with viral breakthrough. Both groups were well
   tolerated.
   Conclusion: The de novo LAM plus ADV combination therapy for
   treatment-naive patients with CHB was greater than ETV monotherapy in
   both biochemical response and HBeAg seroconversion rate up to 96 weeks.
   The rate of emergence of viral resistance in the combination group was
   less than that in the ETV monotherapy.},

Abstract = {Physical phenomena and the nature of materials require both qualitative
   and quantitative research to be understood thoroughly. This process
   often necessitates the use of complicated and expensive equipments. Also
   in electrical-electronics discipline, especially the nature of
   semiconductor materials and the behavior of them have a special place.
   In engineering education, it is often more important for undergraduates
   to understand the behavior of material and the results of that at the
   basic level. For this purpose it is sufficient to analyze semiconductor
   materials with interactive software unlike physics scholars who apply
   mostly physically to analyze. Understanding the physical properties of
   applied materials and digitalizing the characteristics of these
   materials by coding in programming environment maintain its importance.
   In this context, designing of interactive programs to analyze physical
   phenomena in electrical-electronics engineering without the need for
   licensed software has been presented. For this purpose, some
   semiconductor phenomena involved with electronics engineering have been
   selected as a pilot and web based 3D Java graphic AWT applications have

Title = {Investigation of examples of E-education environment for scientific

Journal = {INFORMATICA},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {19},

Pages = {45-62},
Abstract = {The aim is to investigate two emerging information technologies in
   graduate studies and scientific cooperation. Internet is the first
   technology. The open source is the second. They help each other in many
   ways. The joint influence of both is regarded in this paper.
   Results of complexity theory show the limitations of exact analysis.
   That explains popularity of heuristic algorithms. It is well known that
   efficiency of heuristics depends on the parameters. Therefore automatic
   procedures for tuning the heuristics help to compare results of
   different heuristics and enhance their efficiency.
   The theory and some applications of Bayesian Approach were discussed in
   (Mockus, 2006a). In this paper examples of Bayesian Approach to
   automated tuning of heuristics are investigated. This is the Bayesian
   Heuristic Approach, in short. The examples of traditional methods of
   optimization, including applications of linear and dynamic programming,
   will be investigated in the next paper. These three papers represents
   three parts of the same work. However each part can be read
   independently.
   All the algorithms are implemented as platform independent Java applets
   or servlets. Readers can easily verify and apply the results for studies
   and for real life optimization problems.
   The theoretical result is application of unified Bayesian Heuristic
   Approach for different discrete optimization models. The practical
   result is adaptation of these models for graduate distance studies and
   scientific collaboration by a common java global optimization framework.
   The software is regularly updated and corrected responding to new
   programming tools and users reports. However the general structure of
   web sites remains. The information is on the web site: http: //pilis.

Journal = {COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 28},
Abstract = {Background and ContextAuto-graders are praised by novice students
   learning to program, as they provide them with automatic feedback about
   their problem-solving process. However, some students often make random
   changes when they have errors in their code, without engaging in
   deliberate thinking about the cause of the error.ObjectiveTo investigate
   whether requiring students using an auto-grading system to reflect on
   the errors in their code would reduce trial and error behavior often
   seen in such systems.MethodThe paper analyzes the impact of reflection
   per student and per problem using paired t-tests.FindingsStudents took
   fewer steps to solve the problem in reflective sessions than in Usual
   Debugging Sessions (4.33 vs 8.04) and they made half as many syntax
   errors, logic errors, and runtime errors. However, they took more time
   between runs.ImplicationsThis paper provides evidence that requiring
   reflection in autograding systems can improve student debugging skills.},

Title = {Introducing SourceXplorer, an open-source statistical tool for guided
   lithic sourcing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {144},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Archaeologists' access to analytical infrastructure has grown
   exponentially over the last two decades. This is especially the case for
   benchtop X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and portable XRF (pXRF) instruments,
   which are now practically commonplace in archaeological laboratories and
   provide users with a non-destructive and rapid means to analyze the
   elemental compositions of archaeological specimens. As XRF has become
   more accessible, the volume of analytical measurements available in
   archaeological datasets as well as the number and diversity of
   researchers participating in data collection have inherently increased.
   Those researchers, who have various levels of experience with the
   nuances of lithic sourcing procedures, are also often the ones
   attempting to interpret the elemental data they produce. While
   standardized analytical procedures have enabled inexperienced analysts
   to take accurate and reproducible XRF measurements, interpreting the
   resulting data is more difficult to convert and standardize with the
   same degree of user-friendliness. To address this challenge, we have
   bundled a series of statistical approaches and data exploration tools
   into an intuitive open-source graphical user interface designed to
   facilitate reproducible and robust outcomes during lithic sourcing
   studies. Our application, SourceXplorer, permits easy access to and
   exploration of numeric baseline data using a map interface while
   facilitating a guided interpretation of source affiliations for
   archaeological specimens (e.g., lithics) within any natural context
   using multivariate statistical analyses. We demonstrate SourceXplorer's
   functionality in relation to a complex archaeological challenge by
   examining evidence for the procurement and use of lithic material from
   previously undocumented toolstone source locations in southwestern
   British Columbia, Canada. We also provide open access to SourceXplorer,
   including both a deployed version of the application that can be used
   with any Internet browser and the packaged script, which can be run
   locally in the open-source R statistical programming environment.},

Journal = {DATABASE-THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL DATABASES AND CURATION},
Year = {2017},
Month = {JAN 6},
Abstract = {With its Firebrowse service (http://firebrowse.org/) the Broad Institute
   is making large-scale multi-platform omics data analysis results
   publicly available through a Representational State Transfer (REST)
   Application Programmable Interface (API). Querying this database through
   an API client from an arbitrary programming environment is an essential
   task, allowing other developers and researchers to focus on their
   analysis and avoid data wrangling. Hence, as a first result, we
   developed a workflow to automatically generate, test and deploy such
   clients for rapid response to API changes. Its underlying
   infrastructure, a combination of free and publicly available web
   services, facilitates the development of API clients. It decouples
   changes in server software from the client software by reacting to
   changes in the RESTful service and removing direct dependencies on a
   specific implementation of an API. As a second result, FirebrowseR, an R
   client to the Broad Institute's RESTful Firehose Pipeline, is provided
   as a working example, which is built by the means of the presented
   workflow. The package's features are demonstrated by an example analysis
   of cancer gene expression data.},

   important to highlight that there are no universal guidelines or
   protocols for predicting outcomes in education, including higher
   education. The methodology used for such predictions depends primarily
   on the target variable and the type of input data used. Twenty-five
   papers from the Web of Science CC and Scopus citation databases were
   included in the detailed analysis. Six research questions were used to
   examine what is being predicted in higher education, what input data
   were used, how many Machine Learning algorithms were used in the
   research, and which were most effective. In addition, the research
   looked at what other predictive modeling techniques were mentioned and
   whether the programming environment used for prediction was mentioned.},

   case study are presented of the development of a Web-based flood
   forecasting system for reservoirs using Java 2 platform Enterprise
   Edition (J2EE). J2EE of Sun Microsystems is chosen as the development
   solution for the Web-based flood forecasting system, Weblogic 6.0 of BEA
   as the container provider, and JBuilder 7.0 of Borland as the
   development tool. One of the key objectives in this project is to
   establish a collaborative platform for flood forecasting via Web
   technology in order to render hydrological models and data available to
   stakeholders and experts involved and thus offer an efficient medium for
   transferring and sharing information, knowledge and experiences among
   them. Compared with general Webbased query systems and traditional flood
   forecasting systems, the Web-based flood forecasting system is more
   focused on the on-line analysis of model-based forecasting of floods and
   provides opportunities for improving the transfer of information and
   knowledge from the hydrological scientists and managers to decision
   makers. Finally, a prototype system is used to demonstrate the system
   application.},

Abstract = {This paper considers limitations of existing network technologies for
   distributed theatrical performance in the creative arts and for
   symmetrical real-time interaction in online learning environments. It
   examines the experience of a multidisciplinary research consortium that
   aimed to introduce a solution to latency and other network problems
   experienced by users in these sectors. The solution builds on the
   Multicast protocol, Access Grid, an environment supported by very high
   bandwidth networks. The solution is intended to offer high-quality image
   and sound, interaction with other network platforms, maximum user
   control of multipoint transmissions, and open programming tools that are
   flexible and modifiable for specific uses. A case study is presented
   drawing upon an extended period of participant observation by the
   authors. This provides a basis for an examination of the challenges of
   promoting technological innovation in a multidisciplinary project. We
   highlight the kinds of technical advances and cultural and
   organizational changes that would be required to meet demanding quality
   standards, the way a research consortium planned to engage in
   experimentation and learning, and factors making it difficult to achieve
   an open platform that is responsive to the needs of users in the

Title = {Development of a Supportive Parenting App to Improve Parent and Infant
   Outcomes in the Perinatal Period: Development Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},

Month = {DEC 24},
Abstract = {Background: The transition to parenthood can be challenging, and parents
   are vulnerable to psychological disorders during the perinatal period.
   This may have adverse long-term consequences on a child's development.
   Given the rise in technology and parents' preferences for mobile health
   apps, a supportive mobile health intervention is optimal However, there
   is a lack of a theoretical framework and technology-based perinatal
   educational intervention for couples with healthy infants.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to describe the Supportive Parenting
   App (SPA) development procedure and highlight the challenges and lessons
   learned.
   Methods: The SPA development procedure was guided by the information
   systems research framework, which emphasizes a nonlinear, iterative, and
   user-centered process involving 3 research cycles-the relevance cycle,
   design cycle, and rigor cycle. Treatment fidelity was ensured, and team
   cohesiveness was maintained using strategies from the Tuckman model of
   team development.
   Results: In the relevance cycle, end-user requirements were identified
   through focus groups and interviews. In the rigor cycle, the user
   engagement pyramid and well-established theories (social cognitive
   theory proposed by Bandura and attachment theory proposed by Bowlby)
   were used to inform and justify the features of the artifact. In the
   design cycle, the admin portal was developed using Microsoft Visual
   Studio 2017, whereas the SPA, which ran on both iOS and Android, was
   developed using hybrid development tools. The SPA featured
   knowledge-based content, informational videos and audio clips, a
   discussion forum, chat groups, and a frequently asked questions and
   expert advice section. The intervention underwent iterative testing by a
   small group of new parents and research team members. Qualitative
   feedback was obtained for further app enhancements before official
   implementation. Testing revealed user and technological issues, such as
   web browser and app incompatibility, a lack of notifications for both
   administrators and users, and limited search engine capability.
   Conclusions: The information systems research framework documented the
   technical details of the SPA but did not take into consideration the
   interpersonal and real-life challenges. Ineffective communication
   between the health care research team and the app developers, limited
   resources, and the COVID-19 pandemic were the main challenges faced
   during content development. Quick adaptability, team cohesion, and
   hindsight budgeting are crucial for intervention development. Although
   the effectiveness of the SPA in improving parental and infant outcomes
   is currently unknown, this detailed intervention development study
   highlights the key aspects that need to be considered for future app
   development.},

Abstract = {In this paper we present a software platform called Chatbot designed to
   introduce high school students to Computer Science (CS) concepts in an
   innovative way: by programming chatbots. A chatbot is a bot that can be
   programmed to have a conversation with a human or robotic partner in
   some natural language such as English or Spanish. While programming
   their chatbots, students use fundamental CS constructs such as
   variables, conditionals, and finite state automata, among others.
   Chatbot uses pattern matching, state of the art lemmatization
   techniques, and finite state automata in order to provide automatic
   formative assessment to the students. When an error is found, the
   formative feedback generated is immediate and task-level. We evaluated
   Chatbot in two observational studies. An online nation-wide competition
   where more than 10,000 students participated. And, a mandatory in-class
   15-lesson pilot course in three high schools. We measured indicators of
   student engagement (task completion, participation, self reported
   interest, etc.) and found that girls' engagement with Chatbot was higher
   than boys' for most indicators. Also, in the online competition, the
   task completion rate for the students that decided to use Chatbot was
   five times higher than for the students that chose to use the renowned
   animation and game programming tool Alice. Our results suggest that the
   availability of automatic formative assessment may have an impact on
   task completion and other engagement indicators among high school
   students.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ASTRONOMY AND SPACE SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 31},
Abstract = {ESA's Swarm mission is a constellation probing both Earth's interior and
   geospace, delivering magnetic and plasma measurements which are used to
   generate many derived data products. From empirical magnetic field
   models of the core, crust, ionosphere, and magnetosphere, to multi-point
   estimates of ionospheric currents and in-situ plasma properties, these
   are challenging to navigate, process, and visualize. The VirES for Swarm
   platform () has been built to tackle this problem, providing tools to
   increase usability of Swarm data products. The VirES (Virtual
   environments for Earth Scientists) platform provides both a graphical
   web interface and an API to access and visualise Swarm data and models.
   This is extended with a cloud-hosted development environment powered by
   JupyterHub (the ``Virtual Research Environment/VRE ``). VirES provides
   two API's: the full VirES API for which a dedicated Python client is
   provided, viresclient, and the more interoperable Heliophysics API
   (HAPI). The VRE is furnished with a bespoke Python environment
   containing thematic libraries supporting science with Swarm. This
   service aims to ease the pathway for scientists writing computer code to
   analyze Swarm data products, increase opportunities for collaboration,
   and leverage cloud technologies. Beyond simply providing data and model
   access to Python users, it is extremely helpful to provide higher-level
   analysis and visualization tools, and ready-to-use code recipes that
   people can explore and extend. Critically for space physics, this
   involves crossover with many other datasets and so it is highly valuable
   to embed such tools within the wider data and software ecosystems.
   Through Swarm DISC (Data, Innovation, and Science Cluster), we are
   tackling this through cookbooks and Python libraries. Cookbooks are
   built and presented using Jupyter technologies, and tested to work
   within the VRE. A new library we are building is SwarmPAL, which
   includes tools for time-frequency analysis and inversion of magnetic
   field measurements for electric current systems, among others, while
   relying on the VirES server to provide data portability and other
   utilities. This paper reviews the current state of these tools and
   services for Swarm, particularly in the context of the Python in
   Heliophysics Community, and the wider heliophysics and geospace data
   environment.},

Abstract = {De-manufacturing (DM) is a process to separate a product into components
   and materials that will be maintained, replaced, reused, or recycled.
   Disassembling a selected set of parts in a product, defined as
   selective-disassembly, is an essential need in product DM. Although it
   is necessary to have an efficient and optimized sequence planning for
   selective-disassembly to reduce DM-related cost, it is more important to
   consider de-manufacturability for product life cycle cost at the early
   stage of a product development. However, the product analysis related to
   DM is generally regarded as a post-process in product development.
   Current product development environments require all industry in a
   supply chain to concurrently develop their specialized components
   corresponding to the end item requirement within a short time frame.
   Therefore, it is an emerging issue to add global concurrent
   de-manufacturability analysis into product development environments. An
   efficient sequence planning approach and a supporting tool are highly
   demanded. This paper presents a hybrid approach to selective-disassembly
   sequence planning for DM, which is based on both topological
   disassemblability and tool accessibility. In addition, a Web-based
   application on a three-tier Internet environment is implemented for the
   global concurrent de-manufacturability analysis.},

Abstract = {To date, most genetic association studies of tobacco use have been
   conducted in European American subjects using the phenotype of smoking
   quantity (cigarettes per day). However, smoking quantity is a very
   imprecise measure of exposure to tobacco smoke constituents. Analyses of
   alternate phenotypes and populations may improve our understanding of
   tobacco addiction genetics. Cotinine is the major metabolite of
   nicotine, and measuring serum cotinine levels in smokers provides a more
   objective measure of nicotine dose than smoking quantity. Previous
   genetic association studies of serum cotinine have focused on individual
   genes. We conducted a genetic association study of the biomarker in
   African American (N = 365) and European American (N 315) subjects from
   the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study using a chip
   containing densely-spaced tag SNPs in similar to 2100 genes. We found
   that rs11187065, located in the non-coding region (intron I) of
   insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), was the most strongly associated SNP (p
   = 8.91 x 10(-6)) in the African American cohort, whereas rs11763963,
   located on chromosome 7 outside of a gene transcript, was the most
   strongly associated SNP in European Americans (p = 1.53 x 10(-6)). We
   then evaluated how the top variant association in each population
   performed in the other group. We found that the association of
   rs11187065 in IDE was also associated with the phenotype in European
   Americans (p = 0.044). Our top SNP association in European Americans,
   rs11763963 was non-polymorphic in our African American sample. It has
   been previously shown that psychostimulant self-administration is
   reduced in animals with lower insulin because of interference with
   dopamine transmission in the brain reward centers. Our finding provides
   a platform for further investigation of this, or additional mechanisms,
   involving the relationship between insulin and self-administered
   nicotine dose. Neuropsychopharmacology (2012) 37, 968-974; doi:

Abstract = {Over the last few years, the arena of mobile application development has
   expanded considerably beyond the demand of the world's software markets.
   With the growing number of mobile software companies and the increasing
   sophistication of smartphone technology, developers have been
   establishing several categories of applications on dissimilar platforms.
   However, developers confront several challenges when undertaking mobile
   application projects. In particular, there is a lack of consolidated
   systems that can competently, promptly and efficiently provide
   developers with personalised services. Hence, it is essential to develop
   tailored systems that can recommend appropriate tools, IDEs, platforms,
   software components and other correlated artifacts to mobile application
   developers. This paper proposes a new recommender system framework
   comprising a robust set of techniques that are designed to provide
   mobile app developers with a specific platform where they can browse and
   search for personalised artifacts. In particular, the new recommender
   system framework comprises the following functions: (i) domain knowledge
   inference module: including various semantic web technologies and
   lightweight ontologies; (ii) profiling and preferencing: a new proposed
   time aware multidimensional user modelling; (iii) query expansion: to
   improve and enhance the retrieved results by semantically augmenting
   users' query; and (iv) recommendation and information filtration: to
   make use of the aforementioned components to provide personalised
   services to the designated users and to answer a user's query with the
   minimum mismatches.},

Abstract = {A set of Java(TM) classes was written for variogram modeling to support
   research for US EPA's Regional Vulnerability Assessment Program (ReVA).
   The modeling objectives of this research program are to use conceptual
   programming tools for numerical analysis for regional risk assessment.
   The classes presented use of object-oriented design elements, and their
   use is described for the benefit of programmers. To help facilitate
   their use, class diagrams and standard JavaDoc commenting were employed,
   Java's support for polymorphism and inheritance is used and these are
   described as ways to promote extension of these classes for other
   geostatistical applications. Among the advantages is the case of
   programming, code reuse, and conceptual, rather than procedural
   implementation.
   A graphical application for variogram modeling that uses the classes is
   also provided and described. It can also be used by non-programmers.
   This application uses a generalized least-squares fitting algorithm for
   robust parametric variogram model fitting through the variogram cloud.
   This feature makes this program unique from other freely available
   variogram modeling programs, though the classes are presented primarily
   so they may be extended for use in other Java programs. More traditional
   variogram plotting and fitting utilities are also provided. This
   application is graphical and platform-neutral. It uses classes of the
   recently proposed Java API for linear algebra, called the JAMA package.

Abstract = {In this paper, a Web-based management system for the building network is
   described. We developed a multi-protocol converter based on SoC and
   embedded Linux. It requires an appropriate operating system for
   handling. protocols and an advanced development environment very similar
   to embedded linux. The multi-protocol converter integrates control
   networks of RS-485 and LonWorks devices to BAS through TCP/IP protocol
   or a client with Java applet. The system consists of three-tier
   architecture, such as BAS or clients, a multi-protocol converter, and
   control devices. In order to compare the feasibility of system
   architecture, it was applied to a small BAS system. By using UML, we
   modeled a Web-based control system with a unified TCP/IP socket
   communication and the system architecture. The developed system includes
   the inverter motor control System with modbus protocol for the RS485
   network. The experiment results show that the multi-protocol converter

   encryption for data security in cloud},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {40},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Threshold cryptography is used to secure a cryptographic secret by
   dividing it into N shares and storing each claim on a diverse server.
   Any subgroup of t servers can use the secret without re-making it.
   However, an adversary cannot recover the secret by compromising t - 1
   servers. Homomorphic encryption operates directly on the ciphertext. In
   this study, a Threshold multiparty multi-randomness secure partially
   homomorphic encryption (TM-MR-SPHE) algorithm is proposed to secure the
   outsourced data and perform multiplication and division operations on
   the ciphertext. The model is implemented in Eclipse IDE and AWS Toolkit
   for Eclipse and deployed in Amazon Elastic Beanstalk (EB) environment.
   This model is mainly used to secure the patient e-health details and
   perform computation on outsourced data. The patient details are
   encrypted by the algorithm MR-SPHE and uploaded in AWS (Amazon Web
   Service) S3 bucket. AWS identity and access management (IAM) creates the
   users' service and secret shares among multiple users in the EB
   environment. The proposed model performance is studied by comparing with
   other partially homomorphic Elgamal, Pailler, and Benaloh. This model
   achieves data integrity and confidentiality using the threshold
   multiparty with multi-randomness secure partially homomorphic
   encryption.},

Title = {Developing a remote gamma-ray spectra collection system (RGSCS) by
   coupling a high purity Germanium (HPGe) detector with a cosmicguard
   background reduction device},
Journal = {HARDWAREX},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Despite being widely used for high-resolution spectral analysis and
   quantifying low activity in natural samples, the operations and data
   analysis of High Purity Germanium (HPGe) gamma-ray detectors are seldom
   fully automated due to the excessive costs associated with commercially
   available automatic sample changing systems. This paper introduces the
   design and implementation of a cost-effective, customized remote
   gamma-ray spectra collection system centered around the HPGe detector
   coupled to a cosmic-ray veto background reduction device. The HPGe
   detector system, equipped with a Lynx DSA, is seamlessly integrated with
   an economically viable automatic sample changer. This sample vial
   changer is controlled by a high-torque NEMA 34 stepper servo motor from
   Vention. Web control of the rotary actuator is facilitated through a
   CAD-based programming tool. The remote-controlled sample pick-and-place
   procedure is executed using a robotic arm (Trossen Robotics, Viper X
   250). The DYNAMIXEL servomotors of the robotic arm are programmed using
   Python software supported by the Robotic Operating System. Beyond its
   technical construction, this system is uniquely fashioned for academic
   research, providing invaluable hands-on experience in gamma spectrometry
   to both junior researchers and students.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This study was done to develop and implement the Nursing KMS
   (knowledge management system) in order to improve knowledge sharing and
   creation among clinical nurses in outpatient departments. Methods; This
   study was a methodological research using the `System Development Life
   Cycle': consisting of planning, analyzing, design, implementation, and
   evaluation. Quality Function Deployment (QFD) was applied to establish
   nurse requirements and to identify important design requirements.
   Participants were 32 nurses and for evaluation data were collected pre
   and post intervention at K Hospital in Seoul, a tertiary hospital with
   over 1,000 beds. Results: The Nursing KMS was built using a Linux-based
   operating system, Oracle DBMS, and Java 1.6 web programming tools. The
   system was implemented as a sub-system of the hospital information
   system. There was statistically significant differences in the sharing
   of knowledge but creating of knowledge was no statistically meaningful
   difference observed. In terms of satisfaction with the system, system
   efficiency ranked first followed by system convenience, information
   suitability and information usefulness. Conclusion: The results indicate
   that the use of Nursing KMS increases nurses' knowledge sharing and can
   contribute to increased quality of nursing knowledge and provide more
   opportunities for nurses to gain expertise from knowledge shared among
   nurses.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background and Aim Studies had shown that tenofovir (TDF) and entecavir
   (ETV) are widely used as the first-line therapy to inhibit hepatitis B
   virus replication, which can reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma
   (HCC) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, but it was unclear which
   nucleos(t)ide analogue was most effective. Therefore, we performed a
   meta-analysis and a systematic review to compare the incidence of HCC in
   CHB patients who are either on TDF or ETV.
   Methods For this study, the following databases were searched for
   clinical trials published from its inception until November 2019:
   PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library.
   Results A total of 11 eligible studies were selected, including 70 864
   patients. The meta-analysis showed that TDF was superior to ETV with
   regard to the incidence of HCC, the incidence of death or
   transplantation, and virologic response. There were no significant
   differences in terms of biochemical response and loss of seroconversion
   response among the entire cohort.
   Conclusions The conclusion was that CHB patients treated with TDF had a
   reduced incidence of HCC compared with patients treated with ETV.},

Title = {Density-aware cellular coverage control: Interference-based density
   estimation},
Journal = {COMPUTER NETWORKS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {165},
Month = {DEC 24},
Abstract = {As demand for mobile communications increases, cells have to become
   smaller to efficiently use the scarce spectrum and to increase capacity,
   and small-cell networks will hereby emerge. They may be large in scale
   and highly dynamic resembling ad hoc networks due to the moving base
   stations. The variations in the density of the small cell networks
   impact the quality of service and introduce many novel challenges such
   as coverage control. We propose two novel base station density
   estimators, the interference-based density estimator (IDE) and the
   multi-access edge cloud-based density estimator (CDE) in a
   three-dimensional field. The estimators employ received signal strength
   measurements. We validate these two density estimators by using
   Monte-Carlo simulations. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of density
   on network outage in cellular networks and propose a density-aware cell
   zooming technique. According to the observations, base station (BS)
   density affects network coverage significantly. Received signal strength
   (RSS)-based density estimators can easily be implemented and applied in
   the network communication stack although they are more prone to
   shadowing and fading. Under favour of the density-aware cell zooming
   method, the network outage can be managed dynamically by adapting the
   transmit power, which provides a self-configurable and -organized
   network. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   Cross-Linked Polymeric Micelles for Paclitaxel Pro-Drug-Delivery},
Journal = {ADVANCED MATERIALS},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Translating innovative nanomaterials to medical products requires
   efficient manufacturing techniques that enable large-scale
   high-throughput synthesis with high reproducibility. Drug carriers in
   medicine embrace a complex subset of tasks calling for
   multifunctionality. Here, the synthesisof pro-drug-loaded core
   cross-linked polymeric micelles (CCPMs) in a continuous flow processis
   reported, which combines the commonly separated steps of micelle
   formation, core cross-linking, functionalization, and purification into
   a single process. Redox-responsive CCPMs are formed from thiol-reactive
   polypept(o)ides of polysarcosine-block-poly(S-ethylsulfonyl-l-cysteine)
   and functional cross-linkers based on dihydrolipoic acid hydrazide for
   pH-dependent release of paclitaxel. The precisely controlled
   microfluidic process allows the production of spherical micelles (D-h =
   35 nm) with low polydispersity values (PDI < 0.1) while avoiding toxic
   organic solvents and additives with unfavorable safety profiles.
   Self-assembly and cross-linking via slit interdigital micromixers
   produces 350-700 mg of CCPMs/h per single system, while purification by
   online tangential flow filtration successfully removes impurities
   (unimer <= 0.5\%). The formed paclitaxel-loaded CCPMs possess the
   desired pH-responsive release profile, display stable drug
   encapsulation, an improved toxicity profile compared to Abraxane (a
   trademark of Bristol-Myers Squibb), and therapeutic efficiency in the
   B16F1-xenotransplanted zebrafish model. The combination of reactive
   polymers, functional cross-linkers, and microfluidics enables the
   continuous-flow synthesis of therapeutically active CCPMs in a single
   process.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, there exist few options to support workflow and cooperation
   among mobile users using non-traditional computing platforms such as
   Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs). Considering the growing need for
   mobility and the more frequent use of mobile devices, it is necessary to
   provide support for the integration of these to the work environments.
   In this work, we present the development of the SysCoor Workflow
   Management System (WFMS) architecture, which provides support for the
   semi-automatic generation of Web-based workflow systems and disconnected
   workflow through the use of models described in the eXtensible Markup
   Language (XML) and also considers the use of image, video and multimedia
   presentations as part of the workflow information entities. We present a
   scenario that illustrates a disconnected process and how it could
   benefit by this approach. We establish the requirements for supporting
   disconnected workflow and discuss the architecture of the system that is
   based in the use of XML for the specification of the workflow systems
   and disconnected operations. The workflow systems' specification is
   generated in XML to enable interoperability with other WFMS engines. The
   development of the disconnection mechanism is presented in terms of a
   lightweight architecture for PDA devices developed using the SuperWaba
   programming language, however, the architecture described can be
   implemented using other programming tools.},

Abstract = {Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a very crucial part of maintenance
   and management of buildings and structures. The use of SHM in recent
   years has been increasing due to the advancement in technology and the
   availability of nanodevices and nanosensors which can detect damaged
   part or crack in a structure. In this paper, PSpice simulation was
   carried out to show the response of the integrated electronic
   piezoelectric (IEPE) with a VPWL-source. Then, practical experiment was
   done using Arduino Mega with the ADXL335 accelerometer in a laboratory
   setup. LabVIEW software was used along with Arduino IDE software to make
   graphical visualization of accelerometer reading to be captured.
   Furthermore, a web service was deployed which enabled LabVIEW data
   transmission to a smartphone running Data Dashboard application for
   real-time monitoring anywhere. Therefore, making the system an ecosystem
   of Internet of Things enabling the user to access monitoring system
   while on the move. The result of the vibration test on the accelerometer
   showed that the accelerometer response to small changes in the x, y and
   z axis of the accelerometer which can be used to detect micro-movements
   in a structure.},

Abstract = {The peer-to-peer (P2P) model which shares the content or resources over

   architecture. A new computing architecture: Computing Power Services
   (CPS) which utilizes Web Services and Business Process Execution
   Language (BPEL) to overcome the problems of P2P about flexibility,
   compatibility and workflow management is proposed in this study. CPS is
   a lightweight Web Services based P2P power sharing environment, and
   suitable for enterprise computing works which are able to run in batch
   format in a trusty network. The architecture relies on BPEL which
   provides a visualized development environment and workflow control
   management. In this paper, the collaborated computing system has been
   applied to analyze the robustness of digital watermark by filter bank
   selection. As the result of this case, the performance can be improved
   in the aspect of speedup, efficiency and process time.},

Title = {Using simulation for understanding and reproducing distributed software
   development processes in the cloud},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {226-238},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Context Organizations increasingly develop software in a distributed
   manner. The Cloud provides an environment to create and maintain
   software-based products and services. Currently, it is unknown which
   software processes are suited for Cloud-based development and what their
   effects in specific contexts are.
   Objective: We aim at better understanding the software process applied
   to distributed software development using the Cloud as development
   environment. We further aim at providing an instrument, which helps
   project managers comparing different solution approaches and to adapt
   team processes to improve future project activities and outcomes.
   Method: We provide a simulation model, which helps analyzing different
   project parameters and their impact on projects performed in the Cloud.
   To evaluate the simulation model, we conduct different analyses using a
   Scrumban process and data from a project executed in Finland and Spain.
   An extra adaptation of the simulation model for Scrum and Kanban was
   used to evaluate the suitability of the simulation model to cover
   further process models.
   Results: A comparison of the real project data with the results obtained
   from the different simulation runs shows the simulation producing
   results close to the real data, and we could successfully replicate a
   distributed software project. Furthermore, we could show that the
   simulation model is suitable to address further process models.
   Conclusion: The simulator helps reproducing activities, developers, and
   events in the project, and it helps analyzing potential tradeoffs, e.g.,
   regarding throughput, total time, project size, team size and
   work-in-progress limits. Furthermore, the simulation model supports
   project managers selecting the most suitable planning alternative thus
   supporting decision-making processes.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper presents a model-based design and development environment for
   Web Information Systems (WISs) using Semantic Web technologies. This
   environment called the Hera Presentation Generator (HPG) integrates a
   number of software tools created for the presentation generation phase
   of the Hera methodology. These tools are the HPG model builders that
   help constructing the WIS input specifications and the HPG engine that
   implements the data transformations involved in a WIS. There are two
   versions of the HPG engine: HPG-XSLT and HPG-Java. HPG-XSLT is
   characterized by the use of XSLT stylesheets for the data
   transformations and by the full generation of a Web presentation.
   HPG-Java uses Java code for the data transformations and thus exploits
   more than HPG-XSLT the RDF(S) semantics captured in the Hera models and
   builds one-page-at-a-time. Generating one-page-at-a-time is motivated by
   recent extensions to the Hera methodology in order to better sustain the
   building of WISs with richer user interaction support (e.g.,
   form-based). Nevertheless, HPG-Java lost the declarativity, simplicity,
   and reuse capabilities of the XSLT transformation templates. HPG thus
   fills the existing gap for tool support for the design of WIS using
   Semantic Web technologies.},

Abstract = {Large-scale deployment of biometric systems for web-based services has
   to tackle technological issues related to security, interoperability and
   accuracy, and social issues related to privacy protection and biometric
   acquisition process acceptance. The variety of biometric traits,
   capturing devices, targeted populations and working scenarios makes the
   development of a universal solution for all-purpose deployment quite a
   difficult task.
   This paper describes the design, implementation and applicability of an
   open framework for distributed biometric authentication oriented to
   access-control in web environment. The open principle makes this
   framework a novel and practical development tool for testing and
   integrating biometric algorithms and devices from third parties. Special
   attention has been paid to security and interoperability standards to
   ease concurrent integration and testing of biometric trait matchers
   developed by different laboratories or companies. Finally, in order to
   demonstrate the versatility and usability of the framework, we describe
   the construction process for a distributed multibiometric database
   acquisition tool based on this framework.},

Abstract = {This Ocean-Shot will seek to advance community awareness and practice
   around open science, based on the activities and outcomes generated by a
   growing cadre of U.S.-based and international developers working with
   open software libraries and in cloud computing environments. This
   practice will require additional software and tooling and required a
   shift in thinking toward a philosophy of trust and transparency. Key to
   this endeavor will be to take advantage of innovative development tools
   and practices that will better enable science by decreasing barriers to
   collaborations, reproducibility, and interdisciplinary research.
   For data, this will mark a shift from a central repository model to
   central service model, enabling data-proximate computing. Most commonly
   today, data are downloaded from central locations for analysis on local
   environments. We hope to advance dataproximate computing that
   facilitates the accessing of data in central locations and running
   analysis there. This will mark a move from current reliance on locally
   deployed packages and servers to making products and services readily
   available on the cloud. The project will contribute to a step change of
   how datasets are accessed and used across the community. Throughout the
   decade it will build on the training and capacity development currently
   supported by NASA, and upon the professional development activities of
   other stakeholders.},

Abstract = {The use of three-dimensional printing in chemistry education has
   expanded greatly in the past 10 years. The technique has been used to
   demonstrate a range of concepts including molecular structure, orbitals,
   and point groups; to produce chemical equipment such as cuvettes and
   columns; and even to print out mathematical shapes and functions. Here,
   3D printing is used to create physical models of two-dimensional NMR
   spectra and HPLC chromatograms to facilitate student understanding of
   these challenging concepts. The target audience are undergraduate and
   postgraduate students as well as university teachers and researchers.
   Methods to create and print tangible models of the data are presented
   using the Mathematica and MATLAB programming environments. The models
   can then be used as useful teaching tools to assist with developing
   representational competence. The underlying data for the models may be
   created in-house or obtained from online databases. Instructions to
   convert the raw data to 3D printable files are provided, and the options
   for optimizing the resulting files are discussed. These innovative
   physical models allow students, particularly those who are visual and/or
   tactile learners, to better understand the complex information presented
   in multidimensional spectra and chromatograms and enhance student
   understanding of these forms of data.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce an XML-based hierarchical QoS markup
   language, called HQML, to enhance distributed multimedia applications on
   the World Wide Web (WWW) with quality of service (QoS) capability. The
   design of HQML is based on two observations: (1) the absence of a
   systematic QoS specification language, that can be used by distributed
   multimedia applications on the WWW to utilize the state-of-the-art QoS
   management technology and (2) the power and popularity of XML to deliver
   richly structured contents over the Web. HQML allows distributed
   multimedia applications to specify all kinds of application-specific QoS
   policies and requirements. During runtime, the HQML Executor translates
   the HQML file into desired data structures and cooperates with the QoS
   proxies that assist applications in end-to-end QoS negotiation, setup
   and enforcement. In order to make QoS services tailored toward user
   preferences and meet the challenges of uncertainty in the distributed
   heterogeneous environments, the design of HQML is featured as
   interactive and flexible. In order to allow application developers to
   create HQML specifications correctly and easily, we have designed and
   developed a unified visual QoS programming environment, called QoSTalk.
   In QoSTalk, we adopt a grammatical approach to perform consistency check
   on the visual QoS specifications and generate HQML files automatically.
   Finally, we introduce the distributed QoS compiler, which performs the
   automatic mappings between application- and resource-level QoS
   parameters to relieve the application developer of the burden of dealing
   with low-level QoS specifications. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {While online shopping has become popular in recent years, certain
   problems related to customer expectations about the appearance and
   fitting of clothing items still need to be solved. Online customers
   looking for clothing products may be unsatisfied as they do not have the
   possibility to try on clothes and view how they would look on them.
   Additionally, vendors are burdened with the cost of items returned by
   unsatisfied customers. Augmented Reality (AR) can help vendors to
   attract more customers and enhance their shopping experience. Customers
   are more likely to be satisfied with their purchases when they can try
   the clothes on before purchasing them, which ultimately reduces the
   return costs for vendors. This paper presents an AR mobile application
   called Smart Fitting which was developed in order to allow online
   customers to try on clothing items by using 3D models virtually. The
   most recent AR development tools for iOS operating systems, including
   XCode and Unity, are utilized for creating the proposed mobile
   application. After an integration testing for the mobile application
   functions, seven target female consumers participated in the usability
   evaluation for this mobile application which was meant to prove its ease
   of use and evaluate the customers' satisfaction. The obtained results
   showed that Smart Fitting can improve the users shopping experience by
   providing a more realistic clothes visualization than the traditional
   online shopping interfaces.},

Abstract = {The TCABR data analysis and acquisition system has been upgraded to
   support a joint research programme using remote participation
   technologies. The architecture of the new system uses Java language as
   programming environment. Since application parameters and hardware in a
   joint experiment are complex with a large variability of components,
   requirements and specification solutions need to be flexible and
   modular, independent from operating system and computer architecture. To
   describe and organize the information on all the components and the
   connections among them, systems are developed using the extensible
   Markup Language (XML) technology. The communication between clients and
   servers uses remote procedure call (RPC) based on the XML (RPC-XML
   technology). The integration among Java language, XML and RPC-XML
   technologies allows to develop easily a standard data and communication
   access layer between users and laboratories using common software
   libraries and Web application. The libraries allow data retrieval using
   the same methods for all user laboratories in the joint collaboration,
   and the Web application allows a simple graphical user interface (GUI)
   access. The TCABR tokamak team in collaboration with the IPFN (Instituto
   de Plasmas e Fusao Nuclear, Instituto Superior Tecnico, Universidade
   Tecnica de Lisboa) is implementing this remote participation
   technologies. The first version was tested at the Joint Experiment on
   TCABR (TCABRJE), a Host Laboratory Experiment, organized in cooperation

Title = {A Near Real-Time Hydrological Information System for the Upper Danube
   Basin},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The multi-national catchment of the Upper Danube covers an area of more
   than 100,000 km(2) and is of great ecological and economic value. Its
   hydrological states (e.g., runoff conditions, snow cover states or
   groundwater levels) affect fresh-water supply, agriculture, hydropower,
   transport and many other sectors. The timely knowledge of the current
   status is therefore of importance to decision makers from administration
   or practice but also the interested public. Therefore, a web-based, near
   real-time hydrological information system was conceptualized and
   developed for the Upper Danube upstream of Vienna (Upper Danube HIS),
   utilizing ERA5 reanalysis data (ERA5) and hydrological simulations
   provided by the semi-distributed hydrological model COSERO. The ERA5
   reanalysis data led to comparatively high simulation performance for a
   total of 65 subbasins with a median NSE and KGE of 0.69 and 0.81 in the
   parameter calibration and 0.63 and 0.75 in the validation period. The
   Upper Danube HIS was implemented within the R programming environment as
   a web application based on the Shiny framework. This enables an
   intuitive, interactive access to the system. It offers various
   capabilities for a hydrometeorological analysis of the 65 subbasins of
   the Upper Danube basin, inter alia, a method for the identification of
   hydrometeorological droughts. This proof of concept and system
   underlines how valuable information can be obtained from freely
   accessible data and by the means of open source software and is made
   available to the hydrological community, water managers and the public.},

Title = {CodLncScape Provides a Self-Enriching Framework for the Systematic
   Collection and Exploration of Coding LncRNAs},
Journal = {ADVANCED SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Number = {22},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Recent studies have revealed that numerous lncRNAs can translate
   proteins under specific conditions, performing diverse biological
   functions, thus termed coding lncRNAs. Their comprehensive landscape,
   however, remains elusive due to this field's preliminary and dispersed
   nature. This study introduces codLncScape, a framework for coding lncRNA
   exploration consisting of codLncDB, codLncFlow, codLncWeb, and
   codLncNLP. Specifically, it contains a manually compiled knowledge base,
   codLncDB, encompassing 353 coding lncRNA entries validated by
   experiments. Building upon codLncDB, codLncFlow investigates the
   expression characteristics of these lncRNAs and their diagnostic
   potential in the pan-cancer context, alongside their association with
   spermatogenesis. Furthermore, codLncWeb emerges as a platform for
   storing, browsing, and accessing knowledge concerning coding lncRNAs
   within various programming environments. Finally, codLncNLP serves as a
   knowledge-mining tool to enhance the timely content inclusion and
   updates within codLncDB. In summary, this study offers a
   well-functioning, content-rich ecosystem for coding lncRNA research,
   aiming to accelerate systematic studies in this field.
   codLncScape consists of a set of interconnected tools that work together
   to create a self-sustaining loop of knowledge expansion in coding lncRNA
   research. The cycle begins with codLncDB, moves on to codLncFlow, and
   then to codLncWeb, which leads to codLncNLP, before returning to
   codLncDB. Specifically, it includes a knowledge base, analysis workflow,
   online platform, and NLP model. image},

Title = {Dynamic Digital Map of the Springerville Volcanic Field and the

Journal = {GEOSPHERE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {430-443},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Dynamic Digital Maps (DDMs) are computer programs that manage the
   display and distribution of high-quality color maps, digital images,
   movies, analytical data, and explanatory text, including field guides.
   They do this in a cross-platform format that opens associated files of
   maps, images, and movies either from a local device (e. g., a hard
   drive) or from a web source (server). DDMs are intuitive to use, can be
   easily and quickly searched for sample and image sites and analytical
   data, and require no additional software such as web browsers or readers
   to operate. DDMs fill a niche between the extremes in the digital
   mapping world that range from a simple digital copy of a paper map to
   the highly linked geographic information system (GIS) product. A DDM
   enables one to create an integrated study that confines its focus on a
   specific map, unlike other interfaces. They offer an ideal way to
   present, for example, premeeting or postmeeting field trips, so they can
   be pre-run or revisited, enriching the experience. All DDM maps and
   images can be saved to disk for printing, and data saved to
   tab-delimited files. DDMs are made using the open-source DDM-Template,
   written in the cross-platform programming environment Runtime
   Revolution, as assisted by videos, tutorials, and the DDM-Cookbook. The
   DDM of the Springerville volcanic field, the example used here to
   demonstrate these capabilities, was made from this template. The
   template is highly extensible, and ongoing modifications and updates are
   available, as are more than 20 other examples of DDMs.},

Title = {Evaluating Datalog Tools for Meta-reasoning over OWL 2 QL},
Journal = {THEORY AND PRACTICE OF LOGIC PROGRAMMING},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 7},
Abstract = {Metamodeling is a general approach to expressing knowledge about classes
   and properties in an ontology. It is a desirable modeling feature in
   multiple applications that simplifies the extension and reuse of
   ontologies. Nevertheless, allowing metamodeling without restrictions is
   problematic for several reasons, mainly due to undecidability issues.
   Practical languages, therefore, forbid classes to occur as instances of
   other classes or treat such occurrences as semantically different
   objects. Specifically, meta-querying in SPARQL under the Direct Semantic
   Entailment Regime uses the latter approach, thereby effectively not
   supporting meta-queries. However, several extensions enabling different
   metamodeling features have been proposed over the last decade. This
   paper deals with the Metamodeling Semantics (MS) over OWL 2 QL and the
   Metamodeling Semantic Entailment Regime (MSER), as proposed in Lenzerini
   et al. (2015, Description Logics) and Lenzerini et al. (2020,
   Information Systems 88, 101294), Cima et al. (2017, Proceedings of the
   7th International Conference on Web Intelligence, Mining and Semantics,
   1-6). A reduction from OWL 2 QL to Datalog for meta-querying was
   proposed in Cima et al. (2017, Proceedings of the 7th International
   Conference on Web Intelligence, Mining and Semantics, 1-6). In this
   paper, we experiment with various logic programming tools that support
   Datalog querying to determine their suitability as back-ends to MSER
   query answering. These tools stem from different logic programming
   paradigms (Prolog, pure Datalog, Answer Set Programming, Hybrid
   Knowledge Bases). Our work shows that the Datalog approach to MSER
   querying is practical also for sizeable ontologies with limited
   resources (time and memory). This paper significantly extends Qureshi
   and Faber (2021, International Joint Conference on Rules and Reasoning,
   Springer, 218-233.) by a more detailed experimental analysis and more
   background.},

Abstract = {The use of technology-enabled environments to facilitate online
   education has increasingly gained importance to promote learning. Tools
   like learning management systems, virtual laboratory platforms, online
   monitoring, and mentoring tools, all form a concrete technology bed for
   augmenting online education. However, successful use of these segregated
   tools is possible only through the implementation of a structured
   process or framework of usage of these tools for learning. In this
   paper, we propose a comprehensive framework for supporting progressive
   learning of software development by students. This framework provides
   guidelines for structuring individual and collaborative programming
   activities of students at various levels and is realized through the
   implementation of a tool named eGuru. This tool is used for managing,
   monitoring, mentoring, and facilitating collaborative programming
   activities of students and also provides a detailed user interface for
   facilitating the academic activities of teachers and lab instructors.
   Peers, alumni, and industry experts also play important roles in
   providing online mentoring using this tool. The execution structure
   proposed in the framework is effective not only for promoting online
   programming education but also creates a virtual environment analogous
   to the collaborative development environment existing in the software
   industry, and thus helps in preparing students for the future.},

Abstract = {The automatic production of performance models of software products can,
   encourage software designers to include performance validation in their
   best practices.
   The incorporation of methods for automatic production can also be of
   interest of CASE tool vendors to improve the capabilities of their
   commercial software development environments.
   This paper deals with a method that introduces a systematic approach
   towards the automatic production of performance models of web
   applications (i.e. software applications run on web platforms).
   The method takes in input two sets of data, the description of the
   platform architecture (a general view of the system platform and a
   detailed view of the packet flow in the platform itself) and a set of
   data that describes the. workload imposed on the platform by the
   application.
   The produced model is an extended queueing network ready to be used by
   conventional evaluation tools to derive predictions on the performance
   of the software applications.
   An example is given of the method application, in which predictions of
   the performance of the application area obtained versus various
   combinations of the processing powers of the interacting hosts. (C) 2002

Abstract = {Various programming environments for End-User Development (EUD) allow
   the composition of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, i.e.,
   connections between IoT objects to personalize their joint behavior.
   These environments, however, only support a one-to-one mapping between
   pairs of object instances, and adopt a low level of abstraction that
   forces users to be aware of every single technology they may encounter
   in their applications. As a consequence, numerous open questions remain:
   would a ``higher level{''} of abstraction help users creating their IoT
   applications more effectively and efficiently compared with the
   contemporary low-level representation? Which representation would users
   prefer? How high-level IoT applications could be actually executed? To
   answer these questions, we introduce EUPont, a high-level semantic model
   for EUD in the IoT. EUPont allows the creation of high-level IoT
   applications, able to adapt to different contextual situations. By
   integrating the ontology in the architecture of an EUD platform, we
   demonstrate how the semantic capabilities of the model allow the
   execution of high-level IoT applications. Furthermore, we evaluate the
   approach in a user study with 30 participants, by comparing a Web
   interface for composing IoT applications powered by EUPont with the one
   employed by a widely used EUD platform. Results show that the high-level
   approach is understandable, and it allows users to create IoT
   applications more correctly and quickly than contemporary solutions.},

Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article describes a sensor-based physical computing system, called
   the Data Sensor Hub (DaSH), which enables students to process, analyze,
   and display data streams collected using a variety of sensors. The
   system is built around the portable and affordable BBC micro:bit
   microcontroller (expanded with the gator:bit), which students program
   using a visual, cloud-based programming environment intended for
   novices. Students connect a variety of sensors (measuring temperature,
   humidity, carbon dioxide, sound, acceleration, magnetism, etc.) and
   write programs to analyze and visualize the collected sensor data
   streams. The article also describes two instructional units intended for
   middle grade science classes that use this sensor-based system. These
   inquiry-oriented units engage students in designing the system to
   collect data from the world around them to investigate scientific
   phenomena of interest. The units are designed to help students develop
   the ability to meaningfully integrate computing as they engage in
   place-based learning activities while using tools that more closely
   approximate the practices of contemporary scientists as well as other
   STEM workers. Finally, the article articulates how the DaSH and units
   have elicited different kinds of teacher practices using student drawn
   modeling activities, facilitating debugging practices, and developing
   place-based science practices.},

Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Contemporary software development is based on global sharing of software
   component libraries. As a result, programmers spend much time reading
   reference documentation rather than writing code, making library
   reference documentation a central programming tool. Traditionally,
   reference documentation is designed for textbooks even though it may be
   distributed online. However, the computer provides new dimensions of
   change, evolution, and adaptation that can be utilized to support
   efficiency and quality in software development. What is difficult to
   determine is how the electronic text dimensions best can be utilized in
   library reference documentation.
   This article presents a study of the design of electronic reference
   documentation for software component libraries. Results are drawn from a
   study in an industrial environment based on the use of an experimental
   electronic reference documentation (called Dynamic Javadoc or DJavadoc)
   used in a real-work situation for 4 months. The results from interviews
   with programmers indicate that the electronic library reference
   documentation does not require adaptation or evolution on an individual
   level. More importantly, reference documentation should facilitate the
   transfer of code from documentation to source files and also support the
   integration of multiple documentation sources. (C) 2002 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {Despite the increasing degree of automation in industry, manual or

   The transformation to smart processes in manufacturing leads to a higher
   deployment of data-driven approaches to support the worker. Upcoming
   technologies in this context are oftentimes based on the
   gesture-recognition, - monitoring or - control. This contribution
   systematically reviews gesture or motion capturing technologies and the
   utilization of gesture data in the ergonomic assessment, gesture-based
   robot control strategies as well as the identification of COVID-19
   symptoms. Subsequently, two applications are presented in detail. First,
   a holistic human-centric optimization method for line-balancing using a
   novel indicator - ErgoTakt - derived by motion capturing. ErgoTakt
   improves the legacy takt-time and helps to find an optimum between the
   ergonomic evaluation of an assembly station and the takt-time balancing.
   An optimization algorithm is developed to find the best-fitting solution
   by minimizing a function of the ergonomic RULA-score and the cycle time
   of each assembly workstation with respect to the workers' ability. The
   second application is gesture-based robot-control. A cloud-based
   approach utilizing a generally accessible hand-tracking model embedded
   in a low-code IoT programming environment is shown.},

Abstract = {Common data models standardize the structures and semantics of health
   datasets, enabling reproducibility and large-scale studies that leverage
   the data from multiple locations and settings. The Observational Medical
   Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) is one of the leading
   common data models. While there is a strong incentive to convert
   datasets to OMOP, the conversion is time and resource-intensive, leaving
   the research community in need of tools for mapping data to OMOP. We
   propose an extract, transform, load (ETL) framework that is
   metadata-driven and generic across source datasets. The ETL framework
   uses a new data manipulation language (DML) that organizes SQL snippets
   in YAML. Our framework includes a compiler that converts YAML files with
   mapping logic into an ETL script. Access to the ETL framework is
   available via a web application, allowing users to upload and edit YAML
   files via web editor and obtain an ETL SQL script for use in development
   environments. The structure of the DML maximizes readability,
   refactoring, and maintainability, while minimizing technical debt and
   standardizing the writing of ETL operations for mapping to OMOP. Our
   framework also supports transparency of the mapping process and reuse by
   different institutions.},

Abstract = {With the aim of delivering goods and services to customers, optimal
   delivery channel selection is a significant part of supply chain
   management. Several heuristics have been developed to solve the variants
   of distribution center allocation and vehicle routing problems. In
   reality, small-scale suppliers cannot afford research and development
   departments to optimize their distribution networks. In this context,
   this research work develops a model for an online to offline (O2O)
   supply chain management network of a small-scale household electric
   components manufacturer for delivering goods to its distribution centers
   and retailers. Retailers are acquired by the company through investment
   in the O2O channel of e-commerce. Electric power transmission and
   distribution is considered as representative of the product distribution
   network. A model is developed using a combination of the supply chain
   management technique and power transmission terminologies. The
   constrained linear programming model is solved through the linear
   programming tool of the LINGO optimization software and the global
   optimum results for the proposed quantity allocation problem are
   achieved. A numerical experiment is provided to illustrate the practical
   applicability of the model and the optimal results are analyzed for

   digestion, reduction, and deglycosylation of an intact antibody, which
   can take place in microseconds with high reaction yields in aqueous
   microdroplets at room temperature. As a result, fast structural
   characterization of a monoclonal antibody, essential for assessing its
   quality as a therapeutic drug, can be enabled. We found that the IgG1
   antibody can be digested completely by the IdeS protease in aqueous
   microdroplets in 250 microseconds, a 7.5 million-fold improvement in
   speed in comparison to traditional digestion in bulk solution (>30 min).
   Strikingly, inclusion of the reductant tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine in
   the spray solution caused simultaneous antibody digestion and disulfide
   bond reduction. Digested and reduced antibody fragments were either
   collected or analyzed online by mass spectrometry. Further addition of
   PNGase F glycosylase into the spray solution led to antibody
   deglycosylation, thereby producing reduced and deglycosylated fragments
   of analytical importance. In addition, glycated fragments of IgG1
   derived from glucose modification were identified rapidly with this
   ultrafast digestion/reduction technique. We suggest that microdroplets
   can serve as powerful microreactors for both exploring large-molecule
   reactions and speeding their structural analyses.},

Abstract = {Visual programming has transformed the art of programming in recent
   years. Several organizations are in race to develop novel ideas to run
   visual programming in multiple domains with Internet of Things. IoT,
   being the most emerging area of computing, needs substantial
   contribution from the visual programming paradigm for its technological
   propagation. This paper surveys visual programming languages being
   served for application development, especially in Internet of Things
   field. 13 such languages are visited from several popular
   research-electronic databases (e. g., IEEE Xplore, Science Direct,
   Springer Link, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Postscapes) and
   compared under four key attributes such as programming environment,
   license, project repository, and platform supports. Grouped into two
   segments, open source and proprietary platform, these visual languages
   pertain few crucial challenges that have been elaborated in this
   literature. The main goal of this paper is to present existing VPLs per
   their parametric proforma to enable na `` ive developers and researchers
   in the field of IoT to choose appropriate variant of VPL for particular
   type of application. It is also worth validating the usability and

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present a Hardware/Software design approach
   for the real-time implementation of a digital reactivity meter on a Zynq
   SoC platform (FPGA: Field-Programmable Gate Array). As a primary design
   tool, the Xilinx System Generator (XSG) programming tool has been used.
   The elementary hardware digital processing units, used to solve the
   inverse kinetics equations, have been implemented inside the Programming
   Logic (PL) part of the Zynq platform. Other secondary tasks, such as
   communication with the host PC, data storage and display have been
   devoted to the software application running on the Processing System
   (PS) part. A dedicated Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been also
   developed on a remote host computer. This application will be
   essentially used to handle the communication with the embedded
   reactivity measurement system and to display the reactivity evolution
   curves through the time. The design has been validated by comparing the
   obtained results with those proposed in the literature. Real plant data,
   acquired from Es-salam research reactor, has been also used to confirm
   the online efficiency of the design. Experimental results demonstrate
   that the system works well for both negative and positive reactivity
   insertions.},

   Generation},
Journal = {INFORMATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Open software repositories make large amounts of source code publicly
   available. Potentially, this source code could be used as training data
   to develop new, machine learning-based programming tools. For many
   applications, however, raw code scraped from online repositories does
   not constitute an adequate training dataset. Building on the recent and
   rapid improvements in machine translation (MT), one possibly very
   interesting application is code generation from natural language
   descriptions. One of the bottlenecks in developing these MT-inspired
   systems is the acquisition of parallel text-code corpora required for
   training code-generative models. This paper addresses the problem of
   automatically synthetizing parallel text-code corpora in the software
   testing domain. Our approach is based on the observation that
   self-documentation through descriptive method names is widely adopted in
   test automation, in particular for unit testing. Therefore, we propose
   synthesizing parallel corpora comprised of parsed test function names
   serving as code descriptions, aligned with the corresponding function
   bodies. We present the results of applying one of the state-of-the-art
   MT methods on such a generated dataset. Our experiments show that a
   neural MT model trained on our dataset can generate syntactically
   correct and semantically relevant short Java functions from
   quasi-natural language descriptions of functionality.},

Abstract = {With the development of high-performance computing technologies, Grid
   computing has emerged as a new infrastructure for applications with
   resource integration. However, some obstacles for the prevalence of Grid
   and Grid application developments are still to be overcome, which is
   largely due to the immature Grid-enabled computing environment and its
   geographically distributed and non-centralized administrative nature. In
   order to improve the situation and support Grid applications, a powerful
   Grid system is proposed as an efficient solution, which enables
   components and workflow support for loosely coupled and geographically
   distributed components on a Grid. An image-processing Grid is a project
   aiming at providing an efficient programming environment. In this paper,
   we discuss the infrastructure of the integrated environment, a flexible
   and useful workflow mechanism, a dynamic resource-scheduling strategy to
   achieve multiple image-processing operations, and an easy-to-use Web
   portal. In the system, components and workflow techniques provide the
   benefits of flexibility, reusability and scalability, so that even the
   unskilled user can easily specify the processing of complex, cooperative
   applications without knowledge of underlying Grid platform configuration

Abstract = {Biological collections are gaining recognition as priceless sources of
   information about the historic distribution and diversity of life. The
   Internet is emerging as the major venue for sharing biodiversity
   information since it supports globalization and broad-scale
   interoperability. This research demonstrates how a Web-based mapping
   application for biological collections was developed using WebGD, an
   open-source software development tool, and illustrates how simple
   spatial analysis help collection users describe the range of
   ecogeographic variation in collections and customize the selection of
   accessions based on georeferenced variables. Our prototype can be viewed
   at http://www.yukon.een.orst.edu/ greene/ms\_apps/home/index.htm. The
   demonstration site has three functional areas: (i) Query, (ii) Analyze
   Collections, and (iii) Add Data. The application was developed
   relatively quickly and at a low cost, since the complex workings for
   delivering GIS functions over the Web were an internal part of the WebGD
   framework. Because it was based on open-source code, costs were greatly
   decreased compared to commercially available software. In its current
   form, the prototype WebGRMS application provides users interested in
   Medicago and Trifolium germplasm with an innovative method to better
   understand the germplasm collections. More importantly, we hope the
   prototype provides a glimpse into the future of Web-based spatial
   analysis of biological collections.},

Title = {Degrees of tenant isolation for cloud-hosted software services: a
   cross-case analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLOUD COMPUTING-ADVANCES SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Month = {DEC 17},
Abstract = {A challenge, when implementing multi-tenancy in a cloud-hosted software
   service, is how to ensure that the performance and resource consumption
   of one tenant does not adversely affect other tenants. Software
   designers and architects must achieve an optimal degree of tenant
   isolation for their chosen application requirements. The objective of
   this research is to reveal the trade-offs, commonalities, and
   differences to be considered when implementing the required degree of
   tenant isolation. This research uses a cross-case analysis of selected
   open source cloud-hosted software engineering tools to empirically
   evaluate varying degrees of isolation between tenants. Our research
   reveals five commonalities across the case studies: disk space
   reduction, use of locking, low cloud resource consumption, customization
   and use of plug-in architecture, and choice of multi-tenancy pattern.
   Two of these common factors compromise tenant isolation. The degree of
   isolation is reduced when there is no strategy to reduce disk space and
   customization and plug-in architecture is not adopted. In contrast, the
   degree of isolation improves when careful consideration is given to how
   to handle a high workload, locking of data and processes is used to
   prevent clashes between multiple tenants and selection of appropriate
   multi-tenancy pattern. The research also revealed five case study
   differences: size of generated data, cloud resource consumption,
   sensitivity to workload changes, the effect of the software process,
   client latency and bandwidth, and type of software process. The degree
   of isolation is impaired, in our results, by the large size of generated
   data, high resource consumption by certain software processes, high or
   fluctuating workload, low client latency, and bandwidth when
   transferring multiple files between repositories. Additionally, this
   research provides a novel explanatory framework for (i) mapping tenant
   isolation to different software development processes, cloud resources
   and layers of the cloud stack; and (ii) explaining the different
   trade-offs to consider affecting tenant isolation (i.e. resource
   sharing, the number of users/requests, customizability, the size of
   generated data, the scope of control of the cloud application stack and
   business constraints) when implementing multi-tenant cloud-hosted
   software services. This research suggests that software architects have
   to pay attention to the trade-offs, commonalities, and differences we
   identify to achieve their degree of tenant isolation requirements.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of the World Wide Web technology, complex and
   diverse data present explosive growth, so frequent itemset mining plays
   an essential role. In view of the mining frequent itemsets in multiple
   data streams by limited computing power of a single processor, an
   improved algorithm of Parallel Mining Collaborative frequent itemsets in
   multiple data streams (PMCMD-Stream) was proposed. Firstly, the
   algorithm compresses the potential and frequent itemsets into CP-Tree
   only by one-scan and applies increment method to inserting or deleting
   related branch on CP-Tree, we do not need to repeatedly scanning the
   databases to generate many candidate frequent itemsets and save the
   running time. Secondly, this parallelized algorithm can be run in the
   MapReduce programming environment. Finally, the valuable frequent
   itemsets, namely global collaborative frequent itemsets, were obtained.
   Because each candidate frequent itemset is independent, and different
   candidate frequent itemsets can be processed by multiple computing
   machines concurrently. The experimental results show that PMCMD-Stream
   algorithm not only can improve the mining efficiency but also have much
   better scalability than the existing algorithms, so as to discover the
   collaborative frequent itemsets from large-scale data streams.},

Abstract = {To assess the environmental impact of wastewater treatment, life cycle
   assessment (LCA) is a frequently applied instrument. However, these
   studies often require large amounts of data. The complexity and
   heterogeneity of these data result in the need for a systematic data
   management approach. Especially the generation of the life cycle
   inventory (LCI) holds the potential to be facilitated by automation. A
   case study in the wastewater sector was used to demonstrate the
   implementation of data management. A database structure was developed to
   store the raw data of the wastewater plants (WWTPs) and make it
   accessible through code. The code interacted with the database,
   implemented calculations, and automatically created the inventory based
   on the processed data. The database provides a consistent structure for
   the raw data and can also be used for backup purposes. Because it is
   machine-readable it can be accessed through the code that enables the
   automated generation of the LCI. As a proof of concept, a sequence of
   the code is provided with a user interface and can be tested online. We
   found that for most use cases, basic programming tools were sufficient
   for systematic data management, and, therefore, the approach is
   considered accessible for LCA practitioners.},

   WDE supports data discovery, visualization, downloading, and basic data
   interpolation. It can be customized for different regions by modifying
   the user interface (i.e., localization), as well as by including
   pre-defined data catalogs and data sources. Access to WDE functionality
   is provided by a new open-source Python package called ``Pywaterml{''}

Abstract = {Ontology construction of a certain domain is an important step in
   applying the Semantic web. A number of software tools adapted for
   building domain ontologies of most wide spread natural languages are
   available, but accomplishing that for any given natural language
   presents a challenge. Here we propose a semi-automatic procedure to
   create ontologies for different natural languages. Our approach utilizes
   various software tools available on the Internet most notably DODDLE-OWL
   - a domain ontology development tool implemented for English and
   Japanese languages. By using this tool, Word Net, Prot g and XSLT
   transformations, we propose a general procedure to construct domain
   ontology for any natural language.},

Title = {On Effectiveness and Efficiency of Gamified Exploratory GUI Testing},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {50},
Number = {2},
Pages = {322-337},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Context: Gamification appears to improve enjoyment and quality of
   execution of software engineering activities, including software
   testing. Though commonly employed in industry, manual exploratory
   testing of web application GUIs was proven to be mundane and expensive.
   Gamification applied to that kind of testing activity has the potential
   to overcome its limitations, though no empirical research has explored
   this area yet. Goal: Collect preliminary insights on how gamification,
   when performed by novice testers, affects the effectiveness, efficiency,
   test case realism, and user experience in exploratory testing of web
   applications. Method: Common gamification features augment an existing
   exploratory testing tool: Final Score with Leaderboard, Injected Bugs,
   Progress Bar, and Exploration Highlights. The original tool and the
   gamified version are then compared in an experiment involving 144
   participants. User experience is elicited using the Technology
   Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire instrument. Results: Statistical
   analysis identified several significant differences for metrics that
   represent the effectiveness and efficiency of tests showing an
   improvement in coverage when they were developed with gamification.
   Additionally, user experience is improved with gamification.
   Conclusions: Gamification of exploratory testing has a tangible effect
   on how testers create test cases for web applications. While the results
   are mixed, the effects are most beneficial and interesting and warrant
   more research in the future. Further research shall be aimed at
   confirming the presented results in the context of state-of-the-art
   testing tools and real-world development environments.},

Abstract = {The objective of the study was to analyze the impact of online learning
   on the satisfaction of agroindustrial engineering students. The study
   was of an applied type, quantitative approach, quasi-experimental design
   and explanatory level. The population was 235 students of the seventh
   cycle of Engineering from a private university in Lima. The sample was
   70 Agroindustrial Engineering students, from the Supply Chain Management
   subject, divided into two groups, the control group and the experimental
   group. The questionnaire had 30 items to measure student satisfaction
   and its dimensions: teacher competencies, quality of the virtual course,
   technological tools; virtual classroom design and virtual course
   development environment. To measure online learning, six online sessions
   were implemented through Google Meet. A pre-and post-test was performed
   on each group. In the pre-test, both groups obtained a medium level of
   perception, while, in the post-test, the control group reached a medium
   level, and the experimental group reached a high level. In the pre-test,
   no significant differences were identified between the groups; however,
   in the post-test it was confirmed that online learning significantly
   impacts the satisfaction of the students in the experimental group.},

Title = {The Package Blueprint: Visually analyzing and quantifying packages
   dependencies},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {89},
Number = {C},

Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Large object-oriented applications are structured over many packages.
   Packages are important but complex structural entities that are
   difficult to understand since they act as containers of classes, which
   can have many dependencies with other classes spread over multiple
   packages. However to be able to take decisions (e.g. refactoring and/or
   assessment decisions), maintainers face the challenges of managing
   (sorting, grouping) the massive amount of dependencies between classes
   spread over multiple packages. To help maintainers, there is a need for
   at the same time understanding, and quantifying, dependencies between
   classes as well as understanding how packages as containers of such
   classes depend on each other.
   In this paper, we present a visualization, named Package Blueprint, that
   reveals in detail package internal structure, as well as the
   dependencies between an observed package and its neighbors, at both
   package and class levels. Package blueprint aims at assisting
   maintainers in understanding package structure and dependencies, in
   particular when they focus on few packages and want to take refactoring
   decisions and/or to assess the structure of those packages. A package
   blueprint is a space filling matrix-based visualization, using two
   placement strategies that are enclosure and adjacency. Package blueprint
   is structured around the notion of surfaces that group classes and their
   dependencies by their packages (i.e., enclosure placement); whilst
   surfaces are placed next to their parent node which is the package
   under-analysis (i.e., adjacency placement). We present two views: one
   stressing how an observed package depends upon the rest of the system
   and another stressing how the system depends upon that package.
   To evaluate the contribution of package blueprint for understanding
   packages we performed an exploratory user study comparing package
   blueprint with an advanced IDE. The results show that users of package
   blueprint are faster in analyzing and assessing package structure. The
   results are proved statically significant and they show that package
   blueprint considerably improves the experience of standard browser
   users. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Population genetic analysis is a powerful tool to understand how
   pathogens emerge and adapt. However, determining the genetic structure
   of populations requires complex knowledge on a range of subtle skills
   that are often not explicitly stated in book chapters or review articles
   on population genetics. What is a good sampling strategy? How many
   isolates should I sample? How do I include positive and negative
   controls in my molecular assays? What marker system should I use? This
   review will attempt to address many of these practical questions that
   are often not readily answered from reading books or reviews on the
   topic, but emerge from discussions with colleagues and from practical
   experience. A further complication for microbial or pathogen populations
   is the frequent observation of clonality or partial clonality. Clonality
   invariably makes analyses of population data difficult because many
   assumptions underlying the theory from which analysis methods were
   derived are often violated. This review provides practical guidance on
   how to navigate through the complex web of data analyses of pathogens
   that may violate typical population genetics assumptions. We also
   provide resources and examples for analysis in the R programming
   environment.},

Abstract = {Bharatanatyam is an Indian classical dance, which has to be studied
   under an expert. In villages, semi-urban areas and foreign countries the
   experts are scarce. In order to promote, popularize and make it
   self-pursuable, this Indian art requires technological leveraging. With
   this motivation, the goal of this work is to automate identification of
   mudras through Image processing. This paper presents a three stage
   methodology for identification of 24 double hand mudra images of
   Bharatanatyam dance. In the first stage, acquired images of
   Bharatanatyam mudras are preprocessed to obtain contours of mudras using
   canny edge detector. In the second stage, cell features are extracted
   that include number of vertical and horizontal intersections of grid
   lines with the contours of the mudras. In the third stage, a rule based
   classifier is developed to classify the given image into 24 classes of
   mudras. The proposed method is implemented using OpenCV with Microsoft
   visual C++ IDE. The proposed method finds many applications such as
   e-learning of mudras and proper postures leading to self-learning of
   Bharatanatyam dance, online commentary during concerts, and adoption to
   many other forms of dances prevailing in India and outside.},

   document. In this paper an XPath search engine is described that
   traverses the internal representation of a modeling tool (rather than an

   predicate expression. A set of search queries are demonstrated on a case

   article, a computational platform is presented to facilitate
   radiotherapy research and outcome studies in radiation oncology. This
   computational platform consists of (1) an infrastructural database that

   information, (2) an interface tool that is used to import and export
   IMRT plans in DICOM RT and AAPM/RTOG formats from a wide range of

   IMRT plan including dose, contour, and image data to aid the analysis of
   treatment plans, and (4) a software package that calculates
   radiobiological models to evaluate IMRT treatment plans. Given the
   limited number of general-purpose computational environments for
   radiotherapy research and outcome studies, this computational platform
   represents a powerful and convenient tool that is well suited for
   analyzing dose distributions biologically and correlating them with the

Abstract = {Web 2.0 has become a powerful means of transmitting information in a
   number of fields, such as communication, e-commerce, and entertainment.
   Nowadays, companies and organizations transmit specific information
   through different mechanisms, such as Web feeds and Web services. These
   data sources enable third parties to incorporate data from service
   providers into their own applications. On the basis of this
   understanding, mashups have emerged as a new approach to develop
   applications and which combine data and resources from heterogeneous
   sourcessuch as internal data sources, Web feeds, screen scraping, and
   Web serviceswith the aim of solving specific needs. Mashup development
   involves activities such as accessing heterogeneous sources, combining
   data from different data sources, and building graphical interfaces.
   These activities restrict the development of these kinds of applications
   only to experienced computer users. Today, a number of tools and
   programming languages are used to help carry out some of the
   aforementioned activities. These tools and programming languages have
   features enabling the integration of different technologies in order to
   solve problems such as data management from different data sources and
   content publication. If this is taken into account, there is a growing
   need to learn about the features, advantages, and disadvantages of these
   tools and programming languages in order to select the tool or language
   that best fits a specific need and a specific level of knowledge and
   experience in terms of software development. This paper presents a
   systematic review and analysis of the tools, programming languages, and
   software development methodologies involved in mashup development in
   order to learn more about the features and services provided by mashups.
   Furthermore, this research also explains the qualitative and
   quantitative evaluation used for the mashup development tools. The
   evaluation was performed in order to measure not only the usability of
   these tools but also the support that they provide for standardized
   features of Web development that they provide. Finally, new trends in
   the development of mashups are discussed. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley

Abstract = {Gorgias Cloud offers an integrated application development environment
   that facilitates the development of argumentation-based systems over the
   internet. Argumentation is offered as a service in a way that this
   allows application systems to remotely access the argumentation service
   and utilize the results of the argumentative computation. Moreover, the
   service results include the explanation of the decision in both human
   and machine-readable formats. The first is useful for allowing the
   application validation to be done by experts, while the second is useful
   for development. It appears that this is the first case where
   argumentation is offered to developers in such an open and distributed
   way. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {34},

Abstract = {Current radiology training for medical students and residents
   predominantly consists of reviewing teaching files, attending lectures,
   reading textbooks and online sources, as well as one-on-one teaching at
   the workstation. In the case of medical schools, radiology training is
   quite passive. In addition, the variety of important and high-yield
   cases that trainees are exposed to may be limited in scope. We utilized
   an open-source dcm4chee-based Picture Archiving and Communication System
   (PACS) named ``Weasis{''} in order to simulate a radiologist's practice
   in the real world, using anonymized report-free complete cases that
   could easily be uploaded live during read-outs for training purposes.
   MySQL was used for database management and JBOSS as application server.
   In addition, we integrated Weasis into a web-based reporting system
   through Java programming language using the MyEclipse development
   environment. A freeware, platform-independent, image database was
   established to simulate a real-world PACS. The sever was implemented on
   a dedicated non-workstation PC connected to the hospital secure network.
   As the client access is through a webpage, the cases can be viewed from
   any computer connected to the hospital network. The reporting system
   allows for evaluation purposes and providing feedback to the trainees.
   Brief survey results are available. Implementation of such a low-cost,
   versatile, and customizable tool provides a new opportunity for training
   programs in offering medical students with an active and more realistic
   radiology experience, junior radiology residents with potentially better
   preparation for independent call, and senior resident and fellows with
   the ability to fine-tune high-level specialty-level knowledge.},

Abstract = {BackgroundTraditional drug discovery approaches are time-consuming,
   tedious and expensive. Identifying a potential drug-like molecule using
   high throughput screening (HTS) with high confidence is always a
   challenging task in drug discovery and cheminformatics. A small
   percentage of molecules that pass the clinical trial phases receives FDA
   approval. This whole process takes 10-12years and millions of dollar of
   investment. The inconsistency in HTS is also a challenge for
   reproducible results. Reproducible research in computational research is
   highly desirable as a measure to evaluate scientific claims and
   published findings. This paper describes the development and
   availability of a knowledge based predictive model building system using
   the R Statistical Computing Environment and its ensured reproducibility
   using Galaxy workflow system.ResultsWe describe a web-enabled data
   mining analysis pipeline which employs reproducible research approaches
   to confront the issue of availability of tools in high throughput
   virtual screening. The pipeline, named as Galaxy for Compound Activity
   Classification (GCAC) includes descriptor calculation, feature
   selection, model building, and screening to extract potent candidates,
   by leveraging the combined capabilities of R statistical packages and
   literate programming tools contained within a workflow system
   environment with automated configuration.ConclusionGCAC can serve as a
   standard for screening drug candidates using predictive model building
   under galaxy environment, allowing for easy installation and
   reproducibility. A demo site of the tool is available at

Abstract = {A successful product development project must tightly integrate
   multi-disciplinary experts through intensive information sharing.
   Although many computer integrated design systems have tried to fulfil
   this need, information sharing in a heterogeneous, distributed, and
   collaborative product development environment is still problematic. This
   research proposes a web-based information sharing system that uses XML
   (eXtensible Markup Language), ontology, and access control technologies
   to deal with product design collaboration problems. In this study, the
   critical product development information is transformed into XML
   documents so that data can be exchanged using existing Internet
   protocols. Ontology analysis is conducted on the XML documents allowing
   semantic differences in cross-domains to be resolved. Furthermore, a
   role-based access control mechanism is developed to allow secure and
   fine-grained access control for each element in the XML documents. This
   web-based XML information sharing system was implemented in a new
   product development project. The proposed method allows designers to be
   more productive and innovative through seamless information sharing,
   exchanging, and searching.},

Abstract = {Environment monitoring is an important area apart from environmental
   safety and pollution control. Such monitoring performed by the physical
   models of the atmosphere is unstable and inaccurate. Machine Learning
   (ML) techniques on the other hand are more robust in capturing the
   dynamics in the environment. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed
   to build a cost-effective standardized environment monitoring system
   (IoT-EMS) in volunteer computing environment. In volunteer computing,
   the volunteers (people) share their resources for distributed computing
   to perform a task (environment monitoring). The system is based on the
   Internet of Things and is controlled and accessed remotely through the
   Arduino platform (volunteer resource). In this system, the volunteers
   record the environment information from the surrounding through
   different sensors. Then the sensor readings are uploaded directly to a
   web server database, from where they can be viewed anytime and anywhere
   through a website. Analytics on the gathered time-series data is
   achieved through ML data modeling using R Language and RStudio IDE.
   Experimental results show that the system is able to accurately predict
   the trends in temperature, humidity, carbon monoxide level, and carbon
   dioxide. The prediction accuracy of different ML techniques such as MLP,
   k-NN, multiple regression, and SVM are also compared in different

Abstract = {A new likelihood based AR approximation is given for ARMA models. The
   usual algorithms for the computation of the likelihood of an ARMA model
   require O(n) flops per function evaluation. Using our new approximation,
   an algorithm is developed which requires only O(1) flops in repeated
   likelihood evaluations. In most cases, the new algorithm gives results
   identical to or very close to the exact maximum likelihood estimate
   (MLE). This algorithm is easily implemented in high level quantitative
   programming environments (QPEs) such as Mathemtica, MatLab and R. In
   order to obtain reasonable speed, previous ARMA maximum likelihood
   algorithms are usually implemented in C or some other machine efficient
   language. With our algorithm it is easy to do maximum likelihood
   estimation for long time series directly in the QPE of your choice. The
   new algorithm is extended to obtain the MLE for the mean parameter.
   Simulation experiments which illustrate the effectiveness of the new
   algorithm are discussed. Mathematica and R packages which implement the
   algorithm discussed in this paper. are available {[}McLeod, A.I., Zhang,
   Y, 2007. Online supplements to ``Faster ARMA Maximum Likelihood
   Estimation{''}, (http://www.stats.uwo.ca/faculty/aim/2007/faster/)].
   Based on these package implementations, it is expected that the
   interested researcher would be able to implement this algorithm in other
   QPEs. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The evidence synthesis and meta-analysis in R conference (ESMARConf):
   levelling the playing field of conference accessibility and equitability},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 3},
Abstract = {Rigorous evidence is vital in all disciplines to ensure efficient,
   appropriate, and fit-for-purpose decision-making with minimised risk of
   unintended harm. To date, however, disciplines have been slow to share
   evidence synthesis frameworks, best practices, and tools amongst one
   another. Recent progress in collaborative digital and programmatic
   frameworks, such as the free and Open Source software R, have
   significantly expanded the opportunities for development of free-to-use,
   incrementally improvable, community driven tools to support evidence
   synthesis (e.g. EviAtlas, robvis, PRISMA2020 flow diagrams and metadat).
   Despite this, evidence synthesis (and meta-analysis) practitioners and
   methodologists who make use of R remain relatively disconnected from one
   another. Here, we report on a new virtual conference for evidence
   synthesis and meta-analysis in the R programming environment (ESMARConf)
   that aims to connect these communities. By designing an entirely free
   and online conference from scratch, we have been able to focus efforts
   on maximising accessibility and equity-making these core missions for
   our new community of practice. As a community of practice, ESMARConf
   builds on the success and groundwork of the broader R community and
   systematic review coordinating bodies (e.g. Cochrane), but fills an
   important niche. ESMARConf aims to maximise accessibility and equity of
   participants across regions, contexts, and social backgrounds, forging a
   level playing field in a digital, connected, and online future of
   evidence synthesis. We believe that everyone should have the same access
   to participation and involvement, and we believe ESMARConf provides a
   vital opportunity to push for equitability across disciplines, regions,
   and personal situations.},

Journal = {IEEE JOURNAL ON EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS IN CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {4},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Manufacturing and environmental variations cause timing errors in
   microelectronic processors that are typically avoided by
   ultra-conservative multi-corner design margins or corrected by error
   detection and recovery mechanisms at the circuit-level. In contrast, we
   present here runtime software support for cost-effective countermeasures
   against hardware timing failures during system operation. We propose a
   variability-aware OpenMP (VOMP) programming environment, suitable for
   tightly-coupled shared memory processor clusters, that relies upon
   modeling across the hardware/software interface. VOMP is implemented as
   an extension to the OpenMP v3.0 programming model that covers various
   parallel constructs, including,, and. Using the notion of work-unit
   vulnerability (WUV) proposed here, we capture timing errors caused by
   circuit-level variability as high-level software knowledge. WUV consists
   of descriptive metadata to characterize the impact of variability on
   different work-unit types running on various cores. As such, WUV
   provides a useful abstraction of hardware variability to efficiently
   allocate a given work-unit to a suitable core for execution. VOMP
   enables hardware/software collaboration with online variability monitors
   in hardware and runtime scheduling in software. The hardware provides
   online per-core characterization of WUV metadata. This metadata is made
   available by carefully placing key data structures in a shared L1 memory
   and is used by VOMP schedulerss. Our results show that VOMP greatly
   reduces the cost of timing error recovery compared to the baseline
   schedulers of OpenMP, yielding speedup of 3\%-36\% for tasks, and
   26\%-49\% for sections. Further, VOMP reaches energy saving of 2\%-46\%
   and 15\%-50\% for tasks, and sections, respectively.},

Abstract = {As software development life-cycles continue to shorten, the need for
   reliable, maintainable and scalable test automation solutions becomes
   more and more important. This importance arises as software, test and
   automation activities occur earlier in the development life cycle with
   the aim of providing accelerated feedback on the code and software
   produced. In this environment, infrastructure and development
   environments are made available earlier to test teams, the demand of
   which can create environment bottlenecks as software and automation
   teams also require the same resources at the same time. To help maximize
   the use of the underlying resources virtualization and cloud based
   solutions have been proposed. However, at present there is no guidance
   on how to design and implement a test automation solution that leverages
   an underlying virtualized infrastructure. In this paper a virtualized
   test automation framework designed and implemented by DellEMC Software
   Quality team in Cork, Ireland is presented along with a macro benchmark
   analysis of its performance over different virtualization environments.},

Abstract = {Inspired by the mobile phone market boost, several low cost credit
   card-sized computers have made the scene, able to support educational
   applications with artificial intelligence features, intended for
   students of various levels. This paper describes the learning experience

   robots. The paper also reports on the students' perceptions of this
   experience. The students participating in this problem based learning
   activity, despite having a weak programming background and a confined
   time schedule, tried to find efficient ways to improve the DIY robotic
   vehicle construction and better interact with it. Scenario cases under
   investigation, mainly via smart phones or tablets, involved from touch
   button to gesture and voice recognition methods exploiting modern AI
   techniques. The robotic platform used generic hardware, namely arduino
   and raspberry pi units, and incorporated basic automatic control
   functionality. Several programming environments, from MIT app inventor
   to C and python, were used. Apart from cloud based methods to tackle the
   voice recognition issues, locally running software alternatives were
   assessed to provide better autonomy. Typically, scenarios were performed
   through Wi-Fi interfaces, while the whole functionality was extended by
   using LoRa interfaces, to improve the robot's controlling distance.
   Through experimentation, students were able to apply cutting edge
   technologies, to construct, integrate, evaluate and improve interaction
   with custom robotic vehicle solutions. The whole activity involved
   technologies similar to the ones making the scene in the modern

Abstract = {In the past decade, quantum computing has undergone rapid evolution,
   capturing the increasing interest of the scientific community, industry,
   and governments. This enthusiasm has resulted in ambitious growth plans
   which stimulate the development of more efficient quantum computing
   devices and programming environments. The easy accessibility of quantum
   platforms in the cloud has attracted individuals to explore quantum
   computing, prompting a comprehensive analysis and assessment of quantum
   device's behavior. The extensive benchmarking presented in this study
   involved all free available quantum computing devices within the IBM
   Quantum Platform. These devices are employed to execute tens of
   thousands of quantum program executions, with the objective of
   evaluating quantum computer behavior and performance over time and under
   different optimization options. Special emphasis has been placed on
   analyzing the transpile operation and the depth of generated quantum
   circuits. The machine analysis tests are conducted using Quantum
   Computing Run Assistant (QCRA), a versatile software tool specifically
   designed to streamline the effortless distribution of quantum programs
   across a range of quantum computing platforms. This software not only
   streamlines the optimization of benchmarking processes but also
   simplifies the assessment of different configurations and result quality
   through the collection of advanced job metadata.
   This study provides an extensive benchmark of Noisy Intermediate-Scale
   Quantum (NISQ) devices, assessing behavior and performance with
   thousands of runs. Emphasizing transpile operations and circuit depth,
   it explores the correlation between final result fidelity and quantum
   circuit depth, comparing results over time for specific quantum
   machines. Quantum Computing Run Assistant (QCRA) optimizes benchmark

Title = {Enabling Smart Agriculture: An IoT-Based Framework for Real-Time
   Monitoring and Analysis of Agricultural Data},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 27},
Abstract = {With the progress in sensor and cloud technologies in contemporary
   times, a range of intelligent agriculture applications has gained
   considerable prominence. It is predicted that these developments can
   continue to pique the interest of researchers in the future. On the
   other hand, it is seen that IoT (Internet of Things)-based models are
   used in various fields. Herein, the primary objectives of this study are
   to enable farmers to remotely monitor and manage field conditions
   through sensor technology and IoT integration. In addition, these
   technological advancements make it possible to take the required
   measurements. Farmers can optimize their agricultural practices based on
   the analysis of the data obtained for this application. Thus, the aim is
   to manage the agricultural process more effectively and efficiently. In
   this study, an IoT-based framework is proposed for agricultural data
   monitoring. Light, temperature-pressure, smoke, humidity, and soil
   dryness values can be measured from GY-30, BME280, MQ-2, DHT11, and
   YL-69, respectively. An ESP-32S development board is used to collect
   data from sensors, and this board is coded using Arduino IDE.
   Subsequently, using ESP-32S, it is sent to the ThingSpeak cloud service
   provided by MATLAB via a Wi-Fi connection. Thus, these data can be
   easily transferred to MATLAB. We create a user-friendly Graphical User
   Interface application so that the data can be monitored and analyzed in
   MATLAB as well as ThingSpeak. This application allows users to monitor
   the data flow in real time and can easily provide the requested values
   such as maximum, minimum, mean, standard deviation, and current with the
   help of a button. In addition, the proposed system sends an e-mail to
   the user when soil dryness and smoke values exceed a certain threshold
   value. The results obtained in the study indicate that the proposed
   model can save time and labor in addition to providing reliable and fast
   data flow.},

Title = {Emotion recognition from MIDI musical file using Enhanced Residual Gated
   Recurrent Unit architecture},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {DEC 21},
Abstract = {The complex synthesis of emotions seen in music is meticulously composed
   using a wide range of aural components. Given the expanding soundscape
   and abundance of online music resources, creating a music recommendation
   system is significant. The area of music file emotion recognition is
   particularly fascinating. The RGRU (Enhanced Residual Gated Recurrent
   Unit), a complex architecture, is used in our study to look at MIDI
   (Musical Instrument and Digital Interface) compositions for detecting
   emotions. This involves extracting diverse features from the MIDI
   dataset, encompassing harmony, rhythm, dynamics, and statistical
   attributes. These extracted features subsequently serve as input to our
   emotion recognition model for emotion detection. We use an improved RGRU
   version to identify emotions and the Adaptive Red Fox Algorithm (ARFA)
   to optimize the RGRU hyperparameters. Our suggested model offers a
   sophisticated classification framework that effectively divides
   emotional content into four separate quadrants: positive-high,
   positive-low, negative-high, and negative-low. The Python programming
   environment is used to implement our suggested approach. We use the
   EMOPIA dataset to compare its performance to the traditional approach
   and assess its effectiveness experimentally. The trial results show
   better performance compared to traditional methods, with higher
   accuracy, recall, F-measure, and precision.},

Abstract = {Multimedia data mining requires the ability to automatically analyze and
   understand the content. The Community of Multimedia Agents project is
   devoted to creating a community of researchers and students who are
   interested in developing multimedia annotation algorithms. It provides
   an open environment for developing, testing, learning and prototyping
   multimedia content analysis and annotation methods. It serves as a
   medium for researchers to contribute and share their achievements while
   protecting their proprietary techniques. Each method is represented as
   an agent that can communicate with the other agents registered in the
   environment using templates that are based on the descriptors and
   description schemes in the MPEG-7 standard. Using the standard allows
   agents that are developed by different organizations to operate and
   communicate with each other seamlessly regardless of their programming
   languages and internal architecture. A development environment is
   provided to facilitate the construction of media analysis methods. The
   tool contains a workbench, which allows the user integrating agents to
   build more sophisticated systems, and a blackboard browser, which
   visualizes the processing results. It enables researchers to compare the
   performance of different agents and combine them to build a rapid
   prototype of more powerful and robust system. The Community can also
   serve as a learning environment for researchers and students to acquire
   and exchange of cutting edge multimedia analysis algorithms.},

Abstract = {JavaScript is a popular language for client-side web scripting. It has a
   dubious reputation among programmers for two reasons. First, many
   JavaScript programs are written against a rapidly evolving API whose
   implementations are sometimes contradictory and idiosyncratic. Second,
   the language is only weakly typed and comes virtually without
   development tools.
   The present work is a first attempt to address the second point. It does
   so by defining a type system that tracks the possible traits of an
   object and flags suspicious type conversions. Because JavaScript is a
   classless, object-based language with first-class functions, the type
   system must include singleton types, subtyping, and first class record
   labels. The type system covers a representative subset of the language
   and there is a type soundness proof with respect to an operational
   semantics.},

Title = {Rotary machine vibration monitoring and smart balance correction},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {During the rotary machine operation process, seemingly small amounts of
   abnormal vibration can often cause serious damage to the machinery over
   time and even increase the risk of accidents. Although professional
   vibration engineers can determine the current health status of a machine
   by interpreting the vibration spectrum information and predicting which
   components will fail, if even ordinary operators can send feedback
   regarding the vibration signals reaching the human-machine interface
   through a system when an abnormality is detected in the machine, the
   abnormality can be made known and processed in time. This can prevent
   the magnified impact of rotary inertia, thereby lowering the risk of
   major damage and the failure of machinery and equipment, as well as
   effectively saving on equipment maintenance costs. This study mainly
   adopted LabVIEW and Arduino IDE to develop a control program and
   human-machine monitoring interface. As the initial experiment on rotary
   machine vibration monitoring and smart balance correction, the
   measurement system setup in this study was applied to determine
   vibration abnormality as well as to carry out continuous online
   automatic balance correction. Experimental verification was carried out
   using active correction and smart correction. In terms of active online
   balance correction, the amplitude correction rate was 96\%, the
   double-frequency correction rate was 102.9\%, and the correction process
   was performed in 5 min. In terms of smart balance correction, the
   amplitude correction rate was 103.8\%, the double-frequency correction
   rate was 103.3\%, and the correction process was performed in 3 min.
   Through feedback signaling, the operator can effectively learn the
   current health status of the mechanical equipment from the human-machine
   interface.},

Abstract = {The development of interactive visual applications is a complex work,
   usually performed with the help of advanced visual programming
   environments. Although a number of tools are available to support
   designers and developers in the specification of a GUI's layout and
   behavior, and in the generation of the corresponding code that
   implements the interface, theoretical guidelines and/or semi-automatic
   mechanisms rely upon the knowledge of the designer to manage usability
   and accessibility issues. Indeed, the evaluation of the visual
   environments is traditionally performed by means of expert-based
   evaluations or by testing with end users. In this work we describe a
   methodology to specify and evaluate interactive visual environments, in
   particular web interfaces, based on the SR-Action Grammars formalism and
   we present a bottom - up approach to aid the designer to develop
   graphical applications that automatically respect a significant number
   of usability rules before the software is released and tested by
   standard methods. We show how it is possible to assess the usability
   metrics of consistency, completeness and user control by means of checks
   performed at a high level of abstraction. VALUTA (Automatic Tool for the
   Usability Verification at Abstract Level) is the implemented tool that
   allows developers to generate the formal specification of an interactive
   visual application in automatic manner, so to perform the related
   usability controls at a very early stage. Thanks to usability controls
   automatically performed at formal level, the designer can use the
   evaluation results to perform feedback analysis of the visual
   environment. The tool is applicable to an already existing interface,
   allowing the designer to evaluate its usability in the development of a
   more usable version. We have analyzed the home page of three web sites
   (www.lycos.it, www.google.it, http://it.mail.yahoo.com/) as a case study
   and we show the related evaluation report generated by the described
   approach. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Eco-efficient anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANAMMOX) can eliminate toxic
   nutrients from wastewater and has been used in several nutrient removal
   technologies. However, its implementation for robust operation remains
   challenging because of process nonlinearity and time-variant
   characteristic, higher energy consumption, excess sludge produced, and
   biomass loss during sludge pumping. Also, sensor failure, process
   startup, and shut down present additional difficulties. In this article,
   an intelligent human-machine interface using an advanced numerical
   solution for a knowledge-based system (called ANKSys) was developed by
   integrating the fully optimized-functionality (soft sensing, decision
   making, and simulating model) data driven by supervisory control. This
   control consists of advanced algorithms (artificial neural network,
   Kalman filter, principal component analysis, least-square
   technique/renowned root-mean-squared error) using commercial software
   (MATLAB R2018a, Microsoft Visual Studio IDE 2016, Microsoft SQL Server
   2014, OPC Automation with XGT series programmable logic controller). The
   developed ANKSys can help in online monitoring and optimal process
   operation by assessing risk and failure occurrences, acquiring data for
   data analysis, and managing operating expenditure. In real-time
   implementation, ANKSys enhanced the energy efficiency, i.e., 16\% of a
   pilot-scale ``LEAOX{''} wastewater treatment plant located at Daegu,
   Republic of Korea. Using this strategy, an optimal and sustainable
   operation for the removal of biological nitrogen was achieved.},

Abstract = {As the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and the fourth
   industrial revolution advance, smart factories and machines increasingly
   gain intelligent features that enable the integration of more
   sophisticated functionalities. Approaches to achieving this intelligence
   involve both internal systems, such as human-machine interface (HMI),
   and external systems, such as big data platforms and cloud services.
   Although current research leans toward studying external systems,
   accomplishing intelligent functions through such means poses more
   challenges in achieving real-time responses during machining processes
   than using internal systems. When intellectualizing machine tools
   through internal HMI systems, three critical issues must be addressed.
   First, HMI functions are structured to depend on the HMI itself, leading
   to a ripple effect where a problem occurring in one HMI function impacts
   the entire system. Second, owing to differences in development tools and
   programming languages, the interconnectivity between functions developed
   by multiple stakeholders to be loaded onto the HMI may suffer, leading
   to potential inefficiencies and increased maintenance costs. Third,
   although various types of computer numerical control (CNC) machines need
   to communicate with the HMI function, the diverse communication methods
   and development tools used by each CNC manufacturer result in identical
   intelligent functions being developed separately for each CNC type. To
   address these challenges, this study proposes an innovative HMI platform
   capable of executing and developing various intelligent functions. The
   HMI platform and its major components are designed and implemented
   through component-based development (CBD). Subsequently, the performance
   and effectiveness of the platform are validated using quality attribute
   scenarios.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses student views on an e-learning intervention that
   incorporated a content development tool and computer algebra systems,
   aimed at improving performance and applicability of mathematics
   knowledge. The study deliberately relied on open source tools, with high
   usability both online and offline, that can be customized to address the
   peculiarities of mathematics instruction in developing countries.
   Repeated ANOVA and logistic regression were among the statistical
   methods used to analyze the data. Key findings showed that usability and
   detailed feedback were the qualities of computer algebra system that
   were most desired by students. Content quality, problem solving
   abilities and internet availability were key factors for mathematical
   e-learning satisfaction. The research showed that the use of an
   interactive content development tool and computer algebra systems can
   help the teachers to be more innovative and adopt project-based
   examination formats that encourage knowledge applicability. The
   e-learning tools helped the students to self-regulate and discover their
   own knowledge, which increased their chances of handling application
   type problems. Among others, the study recommended set up of
   mathematical e-laboratories which can be accessed by students for at
   least 3 days per week.},

Abstract = {The main goal of this paper is building a novel transmission control
   protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP) network simulator engine for
   simulation of distributed applications for which capturing both higher
   and lower layer network parameters are important. There are not many
   comprehensive simulators available in industry and academia to simulate
   distributed applications while reporting the parameters of all the
   layers of the TCP/IP network active in such simulations. The major
   problem in building a comprehensive simulation scenario for applications
   residing on the higher layers of a network by using currently available
   simulators is that a core simulator for lower layers of the network
   should be used together with add-ons or other programs simulating higher
   network layers to be able to simulate the whole TCP/IP network. This
   paper presents a novel idea for network simulation that has not been
   implemented before, which is using agents to simulate all layers of the
   network. In this simulator, each TCP/IP layer is simulated separately by
   using a separate agent and its behavior. It is an integrated environment
   based on agent systems capable of simulating all layers of a TCP/IP
   network, including application and lower layers. The final goal is other
   agent systems simulating a complex higher level web-based distributed
   application being easily used together with these agents, which are
   simulating the core TCP/IP network. For evaluation and testing purposes,
   a simple distributed application consisting of several remote procedure
   calls is simulated. For the validation of the conducted simulations, the
   achieved results are compared with the results of two non-agent-based
   simulators. For the verification of each individual agent function, a
   report is generated that shows the information flow between agents. The
   communication routes between agents are checked manually to make sure
   the route selection is based on the expected behavior of each agent. The
   scalability of the proposed multi-agent-based simulator is tested for
   the given distributed application.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (Al) technology applied to product design in
   Monozukuri (Japanese way of manufacturing) aims to provide computerized
   support to various tasks in developing products that currently rely on
   human experience. As the conventional approach, in which knowledge and
   rules are explicitly given, has its limit, new technologies based on
   machine learning have been recognized as important in research and
   development of Al. Applying machine learning that predicts data to be
   acquired in the future with a certain accuracy, we can obtain efficient
   and less -variable judgment and eliminate conventional work depended on
   personal knowledge or experience. In order to apply Al technology to a
   product development environment, MONOZUKURI Al framework was developed
   on the cloud as a system to facilitate efficient collection of product
   development data, and, at the same time, for managing and leveraging
   learning models extracted from such data. By connecting this framework
   with Flexible Technical Computing Platform (FTCP), Fujitsu's integrated
   development platform, this new design development environment will
   provide various design tools on a platform with new, enhanced
   design-assisting features. This paper describes various cases in which
   machine learning is applied to designing, and presents our plan to
   introduce it into an integrated development platform.},

Abstract = {This paper presents Programming Adaptive Testing (PAT), a Web-based
   adaptive testing system for assessing students' programming knowledge.
   PAT was used in two high school programming classes by 73 students. The
   question bank of PAT is composed of 443 questions. A question is
   classified in one out of three difficulty levels. In PAT, the levels of
   difficulties are adapted to Bloom's taxonomy lower levels, and students
   are examined in their cognitive domain. This means that PAT has been
   designed according to pedagogical theories in order to be appropriate
   for the needs of the course `Application Development in a Programming
   Environment'. If a student answers a question correctly, a harder
   question is presented, otherwise an easier one. Easy questions examine
   the student's knowledge, while difficult questions examine the student's
   skills to apply prior knowledge to new problems. A student answers a
   personalized test composed of 30 questions. PAT classifies a student in
   one out of three programming skills' levels. It can predict the
   corresponding classification of students in Greek National Exams.
   Furthermore, it can be helpful to both students and teachers. A student
   could discover his or her programming shortcomings. Similarly, a teacher
   could objectively assess his or her students as well as discover the
   subjects that need to be repeated.},

Abstract = {Introduction: The availability of a preventative vaccine, interferon,
   and nucleos(t)ide analogs have provided progress in the control of
   chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Despite this, it remains a major contributor
   to global morbidity and mortality. Developments in our understanding of
   the pathogenesis of CHB and the emergence of new therapies are paving
   the way, as we move toward HBV cure. Areas covered: We performed
   bibliographical searches of online databases to review the literature
   regarding conventional disease phases of CHB. We provide the latest
   evidence challenging the perception of the natural history of CHB,
   noting that previously considered quiescent disease phases may not
   represent benign disease states devoid of progression. We explore the
   use of potential novel immunological and viral tools which should
   enhance disease stratification and management decisions in the coming
   years. Finally, we discuss the timing of treatment and how this could be
   initiated earlier to improve treatment outcomes, preventing sequelae of
   chronic infection. Expert opinion: The treatment paradigm in CHB is set
   to change with multiple novel agents in early phase clinical trials with
   the aim of a functional cure. An improved understanding of disease
   pathogenesis and the timing of treatment will be critical to the success
   of new therapies.},

Abstract = {Microclimates are the thermal and hydric environments organisms actually
   experience, and estimates of them are increasingly needed in
   environmental research. The availability of global weather and terrain
   datasets, together with increasingly sophisticated microclimate
   modelling tools, makes the prospect of a global, web-based microclimate
   estimation procedure feasible. We have developed such an approach for
   the r programming environment which integrates existing r packages for
   obtaining terrain and sub-daily atmospheric forcing data (elevatr and
   rncep), and two complementary microclimate modelling packages (NicheMapR
   and microclima). The procedure can be used to generate NicheMapR's
   hourly time-series outputs of above- and below-ground conditions,
   including convective and radiative environments, soil temperature, soil
   moisture and snow cover, for a single point, using microclima to account
   for local topographic and vegetation effects. Alternatively, it can use
   microclima to produce high-resolution grids of near-surface
   temperatures, using NicheMapR to derive calibration coefficients
   normally obtained from experimental data. We validate this integrated
   approach against a series of microclimate observations used previously
   in the tests of the respective models and show equivalent performance.
   It is thus now feasible to produce realistic estimates of microclimate
   at fine (<30 m) spatial and temporal scales anywhere on earth, from 1957
   to present.},

Title = {Real-time Vital Signs Monitoring and Data Management Using a Low-Cost
   IoT-based Health Monitoring System},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HEALTH MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 23},
Abstract = {This study describes the creation and evaluation of a low-cost internet
   of things (IoT)-based health monitoring system for the continuous
   monitoring of vital signs such as temperature, pulse rate, oxygen
   saturation (SpO2) and blood pressure (BP) (both systolic and diastolic).
   Along with an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display and an ESP8266
   microcontroller, the system includes BP, non-contact temperature, SpO2
   and electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors. Using the visual programming tool,
   Node-RED, the data from these sensors are gathered, processed and
   transmitted to the Google Cloud platform for archival and visualisation.
   The process involved mounting the sensors and microcontrollers on a
   special printed circuit board and designing the circuit with EasyEDA.
   The device measures systolic, diastolic and pulse rates from the BP
   sensor, as well as temperature, ECG and SpO2 values. The system works by
   using three push switches to read and display these values on demand.
   The gathered data are simultaneously shown on the OLED and sent to the
   Node-RED dashboard, where it is then sent to a Google Spreadsheet for
   archiving and analysis. This research article gives a thorough overview
   of the health monitoring system, the way it was implemented, and how it
   was successfully validated in a real-time setting. This study examines
   certain vital signs but additional health measures, such as respiration
   rate or glucose monitoring, could be included. Machine learning
   algorithms could also be used for predictive analytics. This would
   uncover data anomalies and trends early, improving healthcare
   management.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes an App Visualization (AppV) based on IoT
   Self-diagnosis Micro Control Unit (ISMCU) for accident prevention. It
   collects a current status of a vehicle through a sensor, visualizes it
   on a smart phone and prevents vehicles from accident. The AppV consists
   of 5 components. First, a Sensor Layer (SL) judges noxious gas from a
   current vehicle and a driver's driving habit by collecting data from
   various sensors such as an Accelerator Position Sensor, an O2 sensor, an
   Oil Pressure Sensor, etc. and computing the concentration of the CO
   collected by a semiconductor gas sensor. Second, a Wireless Sensor
   Communication Layer (WSCL) supports Zigbee, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth
   protocol so that it may transfer the sensor data collected in the SL to
   ISMCU and the data in the ISMCU to a Mobile. Third, an ISMCU integrates
   the transferred sensor information and transfers the integrated result
   to a Mobile. Fourth, a Mobile App Block Programming Tool (MABPT) is an
   independent App generation tool that changes to visual data just the
   vehicle information which drivers want from a smart phone. Fifth, an
   Embedded Module (EM) records the data collected through a Smart Phone
   real time in a Cloud Server. Therefore, because the AppV checks a
   vehicle' fault and bad driving habits that are not known from sensors
   and performs self-diagnosis through a mobile, it can reduce time and
   cost spending on accidents caused by a vehicle's fault and noxious gas
   emitted to the outside.},

Abstract = {Calculating many agroclimatic metrics, e.g., chill or heat accumulation
   in orchards, requires continuous records of hourly temperature. Such
   records are often unavailable, with farm managers and researchers
   relying on daily data or hourly records with gaps. While procedures for
   generating idealized temperature curves exist, interpolating hourly
   records has long been a challenge. The SolveHours procedure combines
   measured hourly temperatures, idealized daily temperature curves and
   proxy data to fill gaps in such records. It first determines daily
   temperature extremes by solving systems of linear equations that express
   the typical relationships between hourly temperatures and daily
   temperature extremes for every hour. After filling gaps in this record
   with bias-corrected data from proxy stations or by linear interpolation,
   SolveHours uses these data to generate an idealized temperature curve.
   Deviations of recorded hourly temperatures from this curve are
   calculated, linearly interpolated, and added to the idealized curve to
   obtain a gapless record. The procedure was compared to alternative
   gap-filling algorithms using an 8-month dataset from an orchard near
   Winters, CA, in which half the records were replaced by 500 gaps of
   random length. The SolveHours procedure achieved ratio of performance to
   interquartile distance (RPIQ) values of 6.7 (when using temperature
   extremes from a proxy station) and 8.2 (with temperature extremes
   measured on site), with root mean square errors of 1.6 and 1.3 A degrees
   C, respectively. It outperformed all other algorithms in reproducing
   recorded accumulation of Chill Portions and Growing Degree Hours. The
   SolveHours procedure is implemented in the chillR package for the R
   programming environment

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {36},
Number = {21},
Pages = {7465-7485},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The mechanisms regulating the relationship between the tropical island
   diurnal cycle and large-scale modes of tropical variability such as the
   boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSISO) are explored in
   observations and an ide-alized model. Specifically, the local
   environmental conditions associated with diurnal cycle variability are
   explored. Using Luzon Island in the northern Philippines as an
   observational test case, a novel probabilistic framework is applied to
   im-prove the understanding of diurnal cycle variability. High-amplitude
   diurnal cycle days tend to occur with weak to moder-ate offshore
   low-level wind and near to above average column moisture in the local
   environment. The transition from the BSISO suppressed phase to the
   active phase is most likely to produce the wind and moisture conditions
   supportive of a substantial diurnal cycle over western Luzon and the
   South China Sea (SCS). Thus, the impact of the BSISO on the local
   diurnal cycle can be understood in terms of the change in the
   probability of favorable environmental conditions. Idealized
   high-resolution 3D Cloud Model 1 (CM1) simulations driven by base states
   derived from BSISO composite profiles are able to reproduce several
   important features of the observed diurnal cycle variability with BSISO
   phase, including the strong, land-based diurnal cycle and offshore
   propagation in the transition phases. Background wind appears to be the
   pri-mary variable controlling the diurnal cycle response, but ambient
   moisture distinctly reduces precipitation strength in the suppressed
   BSISO phase and enhances it in the active phase.},

Abstract = {Amphioxus is widely held to be the closest invertebrate relative of the
   vertebrates and the best available stand-in for the proximate ancestor
   of the vertebrates. The spatiotemporal expression patterns of
   developmental genes can help suggest body part homologies between
   vertebrates and amphioxus, This approach is illustrated using five
   homeobox genes (AmphiHox1, AmphiHox2, AmphiOtx, AmphiDll, and AmphiEn)
   to pro,ide insights into the evolutionary origins of three important
   vertebrate features: the major brain regions, the neural crest, and
   rostrocaudal segmentation. During amphioxus development, the neural
   expression patterns of these genes are consistent with the presence of a
   forebrain (detailed neuroanatomy indicates that the forebrain is all
   diencephalon without any telencephalon) and an extensive hindbrain; the
   possible presence of a midbrain requires additional study. Further,
   during neurulation, the expression pattern of AmphiDll as web as
   migratory cell behavior suggest that the epidermal cells bordering the
   neural plate may represent a phylogenetic precursor of the vertebrate
   neural crest. Finally, when the paraxial mesoderm begins to segment, the
   earliest expression of AmphiEn is detected in the posterior part of each
   nascent and newly formed somite, This pattern recalls the expression of
   the segment-polarity gene engrailed during establishment of the segments
   of metameric protostomes. Thus, during animal evolution, the role of
   engrailed in establishing and maintaining metameric body plans may have
   arisen in a common segmented ancestor of both the protostomes and
   deuterostomes.},

   that allows to get more profits. This app will provide a broader
   perspective for making strategic decisions to increase profits and
   reduce internal investment costs. A case in point is the financial
   sector, a group of financial entities were used to make measurements and
   test them. A design to build a web application aimed at achieving a
   large and ambitious goal by means of defined tools reflecting clients'
   business needs is proposed. In this research, different techniques and
   technologies are explored, such as diagrams, frameworks, design,
   architecture, model entity-relationship, tables, equations, mental maps
   and development tools. Through the Personal Software Process methodology
   and with the help of information extraction, consolidation, and

Title = {An interactive Bayesian model for prediction of lymph node ratio and

Year = {2014},
Volume = {21},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background Regional lymph node status has long been used as a
   dichotomous predictor of clinical outcomes in cancer patients. More
   recently, interest has turned to the prognostic utility of lymph node
   ratio (LNR), quantified as the proportion of positive nodes examined.
   However, statistical tools for the joint modeling of LNR and its effect
   on cancer survival are lacking.
   Methods Data were obtained from the NCI SEER cancer registry on 6400
   patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma from 2004 to
   2010 and who underwent radical oncologic resection. A novel Bayesian
   statistical approach was developed and applied to model simultaneously
   patients' true, but unobservable, LNR statuses and overall survival. New
   web development tools were then employed to create an interactive web
   application for individualized patient prediction.
   Results Histologic grade and T and M stages were important predictors of
   LNR status. Significant predictors of survival included age, gender,
   marital status, grade, histology, T and M stages, tumor size, and
   radiation therapy. LNR was found to have a highly significant,
   non-linear effect on survival. Furthermore, predictive performance of
   the survival model compared favorably to those from studies with more
   homogeneous patients and individualized predictors.
   Conclusions We provide a new approach and tool set for the prediction of
   LNR and survival that are generally applicable to a host of cancer
   types, including breast, colon, melanoma, and stomach. Our methods are
   illustrated with the development of a validated model and web
   applications for the prediction of survival in a large set of pancreatic
   cancer patients.},

Title = {Semantic framework for mapping object-oriented model to semantic web
   languages},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {The article deals with and discusses two main approaches in building
   semantic structures for electrophysiological metadata. It is the use of
   conventional data structures, repositories, and programming languages on
   one hand and the use of formal representations of ontologies, known from
   knowledge representation, such as description logics or semantic web
   languages on the other hand. Although knowledge engineering offers
   languages supporting richer semantic means of expression and
   technological advanced approaches, conventional data structures and
   repositories are still popular among developers, administrators and
   users because of their simplicity, overall intelligibility, and lower
   demands on technical equipment. The choice of conventional data
   resources and repositories, however, raises the question of how and
   where to add semantics that cannot be naturally expressed using them. As
   one of the possible solutions, this semantics can be added into the
   structures of the programming language that accesses and processes the
   underlying data. To support this idea we introduced a software prototype
   that enables its users to add semantically richer expressions into a
   Java object-oriented code. This approach does not burden users with
   additional demands on programming environment since reflective Java
   annotations were used as an entry for these expressions. Moreover,
   additional semantics need not to be written by the programmer directly
   to the code, but it can be collected from non-programmers using a
   graphic user interface. The mapping that allows the transformation of
   the semantically enriched Java code into the Semantic Web language OWL
   was proposed and implemented in a library named the Semantic Framework.
   This approach was validated by the integration of the Semantic Framework
   in the EEG/ERP Portal and by the subsequent registration of the EEG/ERP
   Portal in the Neuroscience Information Framework.},

Abstract = {The rapid growth of approved biotherapeutics, e.g., monoclonal
   antibodies or immunoglobulins G (IgGs), demands improved techniques for
   their quality control. Traditionally, proteolysis-based bottom-up mass
   spectrometry (MS) has been employed. However, the long, multistep sample
   preparation protocols required for bottom-up MS are known to potentially
   introduce artifacts in the original sample. For this reason, a top-down
   MS approach would be preferable. The current performance of top-down MS
   of intact monoclonal Ig Gs, though, enables reaching only up to similar
   to 30\% sequence coverage, with incomplete sequencing of the
   complementarity determining regions which are fundamental for IgG's
   antigen binding. Here, we describe a middle-down MS protocol based on
   the use of immunoglobulin G-degrading enzyme of Streptococcus pyogenes
   (IdeS), which is capable of digesting IgGs in only 30 min. After
   chemical reduction, the obtained similar to 25 kDa proteolytic fragments
   were analyzed by reversed phase liquid chromatography (LC) coupled
   online with an electron transfer dissociation (ETD)-enabled hybrid
   Orbitrap Fourier transform mass spectrometer (Orbitrap Elite FTMS). Upon
   optimization of ETD and product ion transfer parameters, results show
   that up to similar to 50\% sequence coverage for selected IgG fragments
   is reached in a single LC run and up to similar to 70\% when data
   obtained by distinct LC MS runs are averaged. Importantly, we
   demonstrate the potential of this middle-down approach in the
   identification of oxidized methionine residues. The described approach
   shows a particular potential for the analysis of IgG mixtures.},

Title = {A data sharing method in the open web environment: Data sharing in

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {587},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Data sharing plays a fundamental role in providing data resources for
   geographic modeling and simulation. Although there are many successful
   cases of data sharing through the web, current practices for sharing
   data mostly focus on data publication using metadata at the file level,
   which requires identifying, restructuring and synthesizing raw data
   files for further usage. In hydrology, because the same hydrological
   information is often stored in data files with different formats,
   modelers should identify the required information from multisource data
   sets and then customize data requirements for their applications.
   However, these data customization tasks are difficult to repeat, which
   leads to repetitive labor. This paper presents a data sharing method
   that provides a solution for data manipulation based on a structured
   data description model rather than raw data files. With the structured
   data description model, multisource hydrological data can be accessed
   and processed in a unified way and published as data services using a
   designed data server. This study also proposes a data configuration
   manager to customize data requirements through an interactive
   programming tool, which can help in using the data services. In
   addition, a component-based data viewer is developed for the
   visualization of multisource data in a sharable visualization scheme. A
   case study that involves sharing and applying hydrological data is
   designed to examine the applicability and feasibility of the proposed
   data sharing method.},

   and action planning. Recent controlled studies of DCM's efficacy have
   found heterogeneous results, and variability in DCM implementation has
   been indicated as a potential contributing factor. This review aimed to
   examine the primary research evidence on the processes and the barriers
   and facilitators to implementing DCM as a practice development method
   within formal dementia care settings. PUBMED, PsycINFO, CINAHL, The
   Cochrane Library-Cochrane reviews, HMIC (Ovid), Web of Science and
   Social Care Online were searched using the term ``Dementia Care
   Mapping{''}. Inclusion criterion was primary research studies in any
   formal dementia care settings where DCM was used as a practice
   development tool and which included discussion/critique of the
   implementation processes. Assessment of study quality was conducted
   using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Twelve papers were included in
   the review, representing nine research studies. The papers included
   discussion of various components of the DCM process, including mapper
   selection and preparation; mapping observations; data analysis, report
   writing and feedback; and action planning. However, robust evidence on
   requirements for successful implementation of these components was
   limited. Barriers and facilitators to mapping were also discussed. The
   review found some consensus that DCM is more likely to be successfully
   implemented if the right people are selected to be trained as mappers,
   with appropriate mapper preparation and ongoing support and with
   effective leadership for DCM within the implementing organization/unit
   and in organizations that already have a person-centered culture or
   ethos. Future development of the DCM tool should consider ways to save
   on time taken to conduct DCM cycles. More research to understand the
   ingredients for effective DCM implementation is needed.},

   where it should not be, and trigger an alarm to the municipality. In
   particular, we want to take advantage of the pictures, frames and videos
   continuously recorded by cameras installed for traffic monitoring, for
   surveillance, etc. in smart cities where the waste management system is
   supposed to be integrated with other municipality services for

Title = {Integrating BIM into sensor-based facilities management operations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {385-400},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {Purpose
   To mitigate the problems in sensor-based facility management (FM) such
   as lack of detailed visual information about a built facility and the
   maintenance of large scale sensor deployments, an integrated data source
   for the facility's life cycle should be used. Building information
   modeling (BIM) provides a useful visual model and database that can be
   used as a repository for all data captured or made during the facility's
   life cycle. It can be used for modeling the sensing-based system for
   data collection, serving as a source of all information for smart
   objects such as the sensors used for that purpose. Although few studies
   have been conducted in integrating BIM with sensor-based monitoring
   system, providing an integrated platform using BIM for improving the
   communication between FMs and Internet of Things (IoT) companies in
   cases encountered failed sensors has received the least attention in the
   technical literature. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to
   conceptualize and develop a BIM-based system architecture for fault
   detection and alert generation for malfunctioning FM sensors in smart
   IoT environments during the operational phase of a building to ensure
   minimal disruption to monitoring services.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper describes an attempt to examine the applicability of BIM for
   an efficient sensor failure management system in smart IoT environments
   during the operational phase of a building. For this purpose, a
   seven-story office building with four typical types of FM-related
   sensors with all associated parameters was modeled in a commercial BIM
   platform. An integrated workflow was developed in Dynamo, a visual
   programming tool, to integrate the associated sensors
   maintenance-related information to a cloud-based tool to provide a fast
   and efficient communication platform between the building facility
   manager and IoT companies for intelligent sensor management.
   Findings
   The information within BIM allows better and more effective
   decision-making for building facility managers. Integrating building and
   sensors information within BIM to a cloud-based system can facilitate
   better communication between the building facility manager and IoT
   company for an effective IoT system maintenance. Using a developed
   integrated workflow (including three specifically designed modules) in
   Dynamo, a visual programming tool, the system was able to automatically
   extract and send all essential information such as the type of failed
   sensors as well as their model and location to IoT companies in the
   event of sensor failure using a cloud database that is effective for the
   timely maintenance and replacement of sensors. The system developed in
   this study was implemented, and its capabilities were illustrated
   through a case study. The use of the developed system can help facility
   managers in taking timely actions in the event of any sensor failure
   and/or malfunction to ensure minimal disruption to monitoring services.
   Research limitations/implications
   However, there are some limitations in this work which are as follows:
   while the present study demonstrates the feasibility of using BIM in the
   maintenance planning of monitoring systems in the building, the
   developed workflow can be expanded by integrating some type of sensors
   like an occupancy sensor to the developed workflow to automatically
   record and identify the number of occupants (visitors) to prioritize the
   maintenance work; and the developed workflow can be integrated with the
   sensors' data and some machine learning techniques to automatically
   identify the sensors' malfunction and update the BIM model accordingly.
   Practical implications
   Transferring the related information such as the room location,
   occupancy status, number of occupants, type and model of the sensor,
   sensor ID and required action from the BIM model to the cloud would be
   extremely helpful to the IoT companies to actually visualize workspaces
   in advance, and to plan for timely and effective decision-making without
   any physical inspection, and to support maintenance planning decisions,
   such as prioritizing maintenance works by considering different factors
   such as the importance of spaces and number of occupancies. The
   developed framework is also beneficial for preventive maintenance works.
   The system can be set up according to the maintenance and time-based
   expiration schedules, automatically sharing alerts with FMs and IoT
   maintenance contractors in advance about the IoT parts replacement. For
   effective predictive maintenance planning, machine learning techniques
   can be integrated into the developed workflow to efficiently predict the
   future condition of individual IoT components such as data loggers and
   sensors, etc. as well as MEP components.
   Originality/value
   Lack of detailed visual information about a built facility can be a
   reason behind the inefficient management of a facility. Detecting and
   repairing failed sensors at the earliest possible time is critical to
   ensure the functional continuity of the monitoring systems. On the other
   hand, the maintenance of large-scale sensor deployments becomes a
   significant challenge. Despite its importance, few studies have been
   conducted in integrating BIM with a sensor-based monitoring system,
   providing an integrated platform using BIM for improving the
   communication between facility managers and IoT companies in cases
   encountered failed sensors. In this paper, a cloud-based BIM platform
   was developed for the maintenance and timely replacement of sensors
   which are critical to ensure minimal disruption to monitoring services
   in sensor-based FM.},

Abstract = {We present the design and implementation of a compiler from OCaml
   bytecode to JavaScript. The compiler first translates the bytecode into
   a static single-assignment intermediate representation on which
   optimizations are performed, before generating JavaScript. We believe
   that taking bytecode as an input instead of a high-level language is a
   sensible choice. Virtual machines provide a very stable API. Such a
   compiler is thus easy to maintain. It is also convenient to use, and it
   can just be added to an existing installation of the development tools.
   Already-compiled libraries can be used directly, with no need to
   reinstall anything. Finally, some virtual machines are the target of
   several languages. A bytecode to JavaScript compiler would make it
   possible to retarget all these languages to Web browsers at once.

Abstract = {There is consensus within the communications industry that the design
   pattern for the intelligence architecture will be based on a
   componentisation model where the richness of the underlying network and
   services will be available as capabilities. This approach is aimed at
   maximising reuse of capabilities for next generation applications and
   supporting the diverse range of business models. To make this model
   work, an application environment is proposed that exposes the
   capabilities to the service provider (and their application developers)
   and supports them through the complete application life cycle from
   engagement, development, deployment, execution and withdrawal.
   The architecture for the application environment consists of four major
   components - capability exposure function, application hosting, the
   service provider framework and the service subscription function. This
   architecture can be implemented using technologies such as Web Services
   (including UDDI), open standard interfaces such as Parlay and SIP
   servlets, and development environments such as J2EE and .NET.},

Abstract = {Objective To identify the most effective procedures recommended for the
   prevention of preeclampsia.
   Data Sources A systematic review was performed in the following
   databases: Pubmed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane and LILACS
   via the Virtual Health Library (VHL). A manual search was also performed
   to find additional references. The risk of bias, the quality of the
   evidence, and the classification of the strength of the recommendations
   were evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment,
   Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach.
   Selection of Studies In the initial search in the databases, the total
   number of articles retrieved was 351, and 2 were retrieved through the
   manual search; after duplicate articles were removed, 333 citations
   remained. After a thorough review of the titles and abstracts, 315
   references were excluded. Accordingly, 18 articles weremaintained for
   selection of the complete text (phase 2). This process led to the
   exclusion of 6 studies. In total, 12 articles were selected for data
   extraction and qualitative synthesis.
   Data Collection The articles selected for the study were analyzed, and
   we inserted the synthesis of the evidence in the online software
   GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool (GDT) (McMaster University and
   Evidence Prime Inc. All right reserved. McMaster University, Hamilton,
   Ontario, Canada); thus, it was possible to develop a table of evidence,
   with the quality of the evidence and the classification of the strength
   of the recommendations.
   Data Synthesis In total, seven studies recommended the individual use of
   aspirin, or aspirin combined with calcium, heparin or dipyridamole. The
   use of calcium alone or in combination with phytonutrients was also
   highlighted. All of the studies were with women at a high risk of
   developing preeclampsia.
   Conclusion According to the studies evaluated, the administration of
   aspirin is still the best procedure to be used in the clinical practice
   to prevent preeclampsia.},

   the Canadian Physiotherapy Association that serves physiotherapists who
   have an interest in better understanding and managing patients' pain.
   The PSD developed evidence-based resources for its members with the goal
   of improving patient care by supporting professional development.
   However, online metrics tracking access to these resources indicated
   that access was low. The purpose of this study was to identify the
   barriers PSD members encountered to the use of PSD resources and to
   recommend interventions to address these barriers guided by the Theory
   and Techniques Tool (TTT). Method: We distributed an online survey to
   PSD members across Canada. We used the TTT, a knowledge translation
   tool, to guide the design of the questionnaire and identify actionable
   findings. Results: Response rates from 621 non-student members and 1,470
   student members were 26.9\% and 1.4\%, respectively. Based on the
   frequency of practicing physiotherapists' (N = 167) agreement with items

   Think-tank in the educational sector notably higher education addressed
   by such a wide range of challenges brought about by covid 19. The
   characteristic concern that educationalists in Moroccan universities
   have to reconsider in this pandemic period should not be beyond
   rethinking new pedagogical alternatives including approaches, methods,
   techniques and didactic materials which can successfully assist
   practioners of the teaching and learning process to keep up with the
   current alterations. Practical work (PW) is an indispensable type of
   teaching in scientific and technical training and meets a real
   complementary need through real, remote or virtual laboratories.
   Students can consolidate what they have learnt and develop analytical
   skills by comparing experimental results with those obtained during the
   manipulation. In this context, the Laboratory of Engineering Sciences
   and Energy Management (LASIME) at the Superior School of Technology of
   Agadir has developed a low-cost platform called LABERSIME installed in
   the cloud (LMS, IDE) and equipped with an embedded system to drive real

Abstract = {Vaa3D is a software package that has been widely used to visualize and
   analyze multidimensional microscopic images in a number of cutting edge
   bioimage informatics applications. However, due to many recent updates
   of both software development environments and operating systems, it was
   highly requested to maintain Vaa3D and disseminate it on latest
   operating systems. In addition, there has never been a showcase about
   how to use Vaa3D's cross-platform visualization and immersive
   exploration functions for multidimensional and teravoxel-scale images.
   Here, we introduce a newly developed version of the software, called
   Vaa3D-x, to address all the above issues.

Title = {Stabilization of gas-lift oil wells by a nonlinear model predictive
   control scheme based on adaptive neural network models},
Journal = {ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},

Volume = {26},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Producing oil from gas-lift wells are often faced with severe producing
   oscillatory flow regimes. A major source of the oscillations is
   recognized as casing-heading instability which is caused by dynamic
   interaction between injection gas and multiphase fluid. This phenomenon
   poses strict production-related challenges in terms of lower average
   production and strain on downstream equipment. In this paper, an
   effective solution is proposed based on integration of an online
   interpretation dynamic model and a nonlinear model predictive control
   (NMPC) scheme. The paper uses adaptive growing and pruning radial basis
   function (GAP-RBF) neural networks (NNs) to recursively capture the
   essential dynamics of casing-heading instability in a nonlinear model
   structure. Extended Kalman filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter
   (UKF) are comparatively investigated to adaptively train modified
   GAP-RBF NNs. NMPC methodology is developed on the basis of the
   identified nonlinear NN model for real-time stabilization of
   casing-heading instability in an oil reservoir equipped with a gas-lift
   production well. A set of test studies has been conducted to explore the
   superior performance of the proposed adaptive NMPC controller under
   different scenarios for an oil reservoir simulated in ECLIPSE and linked
   to a complementary gas-lifted oil well simulated in programming
   environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Agent-based simulations represent an effective scientific tool, with
   numerous applications from social sciences to biology, which aims to
   emulate or predict complex phenomena through a set of simple rules
   performed by multiple agents. To simulate a large number of agents with
   complex models, practitioners have developed high-performance parallel
   implementations, often specialized for particular scenarios and target
   hardware. It is, however, difficult to obtain portable simulations,
   which achieve high performance and at the same time are easy to write
   and to reproduce on different hardware. This article gives a complete
   presentation of OpenABL, a domain-specific language and a compiler for
   agent-based simulations that enable users to achieve high-performance
   parallel and distributed agent simulations with a simple and portable
   programming environment. OpenABL is comprised of (1) an easy-to-program
   language, which relies on domain abstractions and explicitly exposes
   agent parallelism, synchronization and locality, (2) a source-to-source
   compiler, and (3) a set of pluggable compiler backends, which generate
   target code for multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and cloud-based systems. We
   evaluate OpenABL on simulations from different fields. In particular,
   our analysis includes predator-prey and keratinocyte, two complex
   simulations with multiple step functions, heterogeneous agent types, and
   dynamic creation and removal of agents. The results show that
   OpenABL-generated codes are portable to different platforms, perform
   similarly to manual target-specific implementations, and require
   significantly fewer lines of codes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud-based geospatial processing
   platform for large-scale environmental monitoring and analysis. The
   free-to-use GEE platform provides access to (1) petabytes of publicly
   available remote sensing imagery and other ready-to-use products with an
   explorer web app; (2) high-speed parallel processing and machine
   learning algorithms using Google's computational infrastructure; and (3)
   a library of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) with development
   environments that support popular coding languages, such as JavaScript
   and Python. Together these core features enable users to discover,
   analyze and visualize geospatial big data in powerful ways without
   needing access to supercomputers or specialized coding expertise. The
   development of GEE has created much enthusiasm and engagement in the
   remote sensing and geospatial data science fields. Yet after a decade
   since GEE was launched, its impact on remote sensing and geospatial
   science has not been carefully explored. Thus, a systematic review of
   GEE that can provide readers with the ``big picture{''} of the current
   status and general trends in GEE is needed. To this end, the decision
   was taken to perform a meta-analysis investigation of recent
   peer-reviewed GEE articles focusing on several features, including data,
   sensor type, study area, spatial resolution, application, strategy, and
   analytical methods. A total of 349 peer-reviewed articles published in
   146 different journals between 2010 and October 2019 were reviewed.
   Publications and geographical distribution trends showed a broad
   spectrum of applications in environmental analyses at both regional and
   global scales. Remote sensing datasets were used in 90\% of studies
   while 10\% of the articles utilized ready-to-use products for analyses.
   Optical satellite imagery with medium spatial resolution, particularly
   Landsat data with an archive exceeding 40 years, has been used
   extensively. Linear regression and random forest were the most
   frequently used algorithms for satellite imagery processing. Among
   ready-to-use products, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)
   was used in 27\% of studies for vegetation, crop, land cover mapping and
   drought monitoring. The results of this study confirm that GEE has and
   continues to make substantive progress on global challenges involving
   process of geo-big data.},

Abstract = {While pedagogical and technological affordances of three-dimensional
   (3D) multiuser virtual worlds in various educational disciplines are
   largely well-known, a study about their effect on high school students'

   case study presents students' opinions about their participation in a 3D
   multiuser game-like environment, by harnessing Second Life in
   combination with the two-dimensional (2D) programming environment of
   Scratch4SL. Following a blended instructional format (face-to-face in a
   computer laboratory and supplementary online courses), 56 students
   utilizing Scratch4SL participated in this study, with a view to reduce
   the steep learning curve created during their first-time entrance into
   Second Life. This study identifies Papert's theory of Constructionism as
   a potentially appropriate theoretical foundation for the development of
   an instructional framework, in order to assist students to coordinate
   and manage learning materials with other teammates, using their
   computational thinking skills in collaborative problem-based programming
   tasks. The study findings based on a mixed-method research (a
   close-ended questionnaire and an open-ended interview) indicated the

Title = {Identifying cloud internet of things requirements in healthcare: a
   Delphi-based study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 30},
Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing are emerging
   technologies whose use has been proven in various fields of medicine and
   healthcare. The positive impact of these technologies on improving the
   performance of medical centers is also evident. Therefore, the purpose
   of the present study is to investigate the technological requirements of
   the Cloud Internet of Things (CIoT) in the healthcare industry. This was
   a quantitative study conducted in two rounds using the Delphi method. A
   non-random, purposeful, and criterion-based method was used for
   sampling. A minimum of one paper or research project in the IoTs, cloud
   computing, or CIoT fields should be completed by participants. In
   addition to having a master's degree or specialized doctorate and at
   least 5 years of work experience, they should be faculty members.
   Fifteen participants in the first round of Delphi and 12 participants in
   the second round who completed all of the questionnaire's questions made
   up the research sample. A questionnaire was used to gather information.
   This questionnaire was designed in four main parts with 14 axes and 48
   questions. After collecting the questionnaires in the first round of
   Delphi, each axis was scored on a five-point Likert scale. Finally, the
   requirements for the implementation of CIoT in healthcare were
   determined by the collective agreement of experts. Functional
   requirements of the network layer and cloud computing, platform layer
   requirements, and components of quality requirements were extracted. The
   architectures of the application layer, cloud layer, server layer,
   network layer, and user layer are explored thoroughly. Furthermore,
   communication technologies, equipment types, analysis and management,
   wireless networks and sensors, secure data exchange and management,
   deployment details, and approaches for security management and control
   are the main infrastructural keys that are extracted during the Delphi
   rounds. The findings showed that, with a very high level of importance,
   the use of wireless local networks was approved more than other network
   layer components. Compliance with security principles emerged as the
   most crucial component of the platform layer. We also found the use of
   hybrid clouds and the necessity of software as a service to be
   important. All the experts emphasized the need to use application
   development tools, cloud services, development, and deployment on the
   platform as a service, data analysis, and application programming
   interface related to the requirements of the platform layer.
   Scientifically speaking, they found that the components of secure
   information exchange, establishing secure protocol communication, key
   exchange mechanisms, and maintaining information confidentiality are
   crucial in the field of secure data exchange. Based on the findings, it
   can be concluded that the implementation of this technology can improve
   the quality of clinical services and increase the speed of responses and
   patient satisfaction. It is expected that by identifying the
   technological requirements of CIoT, a suitable model can be designed for
   healthcare.},

Abstract = {A fuzzy expert system was developed for online diagnosing and
   controlling of bioprocesses. The system was constructed in
   object-oriented Smalltalk/V for diagnosing and controlling of
   bioprocesses. Lactic acid fermentation with an industrial strain of
   Lactobacillus casei was chosen as the model system. The performance of
   the fuzzy expert system and the knowledge base utilizing experts'
   knowledge and several facts obtained from the experiments were
   successfully validated with on-line fermentations. The fuzzy expert
   system could diagnose a fault on-line and give reasonable advice to the
   process operator. In order to achieve the diagnosing faculty, a
   database, a knowledge base, and both backward and forward chaining
   procedures were implemented employing the object-oriented programming
   environment. A defuzzifier was implemented in the system to achieve
   on-line control. In order to realize a decision-making system with a
   human operator and a fuzzy expert system, a new control strategy named
   Advice was also introduced. Several cultivations were carried out in
   order to collect knowledge on the effects concerned with inoculum
   properties to the process and to construct a database including standard
   time-course profiles. The performance of the fuzzy expert control system
   was successfully tested with on-line experiments.},

   PhoneGap, Sencha Touch, and Titanium are well-known frameworks designed
   for this purpose. The main goal of this research is to analyze their
   current state of maturity. In that direction, an application was
   developed in PhoneGap, Titanium, and Sencha, as well as native versions
   for Android and iOS were implemented. Such mobile application obtain
   information from sensors, uses camera to take pictures, applies image
   filters, and establishes connection to a remote Web Service. We analyzed
   the feasibility to build this kind of mobile application, the
   performance of each version, and the development effort. With our

Abstract = {This paper proposes a new methodology of migration from IEC 61131-3 PLCs
   to IEC 61499 function blocks. The aim of this migration process is to
   recreate IEC 61131-3 applications in IEC 61499 implementations with
   equivalent execution behavior. The formal model of the IEC 61131-3
   standard for migration and cyclical execution model is defined. This
   method also creates a foundation for correct-by-design development tools
   and automatic migration between the IEC 61131-3 and IEC 61499 standard.
   Formal migration rules based on ontology mappings, restoring execution
   model including tasks and programs scheduling and variables mapping with
   different access levels, are provided. A transformation engine for
   importing PLC code, mapping from PLC ontology model to function block
   model and code generation is implemented based on the ontological
   knowledge base and semantic query-enhanced web rule language. The
   migration approach is demonstrated on a simple airport baggage handling
   system.},

Abstract = {Quantification of hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX) kinetics can provide
   information on the stability of individual amino acids in proteins by
   finding the degree to which the local backbone environment corresponds
   to that of a random coil. When characterized by mass spectrometry,
   extraction of HDX kinetics is not possible because different residue
   exchange rates become merged depending on the peptides that are formed
   during proteolytic digestion. We have recently developed an advanced
   programming tool called HDXmodeller, which enables the exchange rates of
   individual amino acids to be understood by optimization of
   low-resolution HDX-mass spectrometry (MS) data. HDXmodeller is also
   uniquely able to appraise each optimization and quantify the accuracy of
   modeled exchange rates ab initio using a novel autovalidation method
   based on a covariance matrix. Here, we address the noise-handling
   capabilities of HDXmodeller and demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   algorithm on self-inconsistent datasets. Reference intervals for
   experimental HDX-MS data are also derived, and this information is
   presented in an updated online workflow for HDXmodeller, allowing users
   to evaluate the consistency of their data. The development of a modified
   version of HDXmodeller is also discussed with enhanced noise-handling
   capability brought about through loss function optimization. Changes in
   optimizer accuracy with different loss functions are also demonstrated
   along with the effectiveness of HDXmodeller to select the most effective
   optimizer for different data using currently embedded autovalidation
   criteria.},

Abstract = {Sustainable social and economic programs for aging citizens are needed
   to address the increase in life expectancy in developed countries.
   Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) services, also known as Active and Health
   Aging (AHA) services, is a European initiative that promotes a new era
   of integrated solutions that include hardware, software, and human
   services. One of the impediments to the adoption of these services is
   the lack of an economically viable marketplace. The electronic commerce
   (eCommerce) industry, in which buyers and sellers meet over electronic
   systems, can facilitate this emerging market of integrated services. We
   present the concept of an online store for integrated services, which
   enables users to connect the services available in the store to their
   development environment and to the infrastructure in which they are
   deployed, supporting the services full life cycle. This novel
   market-oriented approach, driven by technology and not by a specific
   vendor or tailored to a proprietary platform, is expected to radically
   improve and promote the adoption of these services. The general design
   approach and architecture of the online store and its capabilities are
   analyzed, and a specific implementation of a one-stop online shop for
   AAL services, named uStore, is described in depth.},

Abstract = {Over the last years, capabilities of robotic systems have quantitatively
   and qualitatively improved. But going beyond isolated robotic systems,
   the integration and interoperability of robotic capabilities in complex
   work processes remains a major challenge. This lack of tools to
   integrate robots needs to be addressed on technical, semantic and
   organizational level. In the ROBxTASK research project, we developed an
   approach to support cooperation between different types of users in
   order to enable domain experts, with no robotic know-how, to work with
   robot-assisted workflows. By engineering robotic skills at a useful and
   usable level of abstraction for experts in different domains, we aim to
   increase re-usability of these skills on two different levels, (robotic)
   device level, and on level of application specific workflows. The
   researched prototype consists of a web platform, which allows (a)
   engineers to register (robotic) devices and the implemented skills of
   the devices, (b) domain experts to use a graphical task design
   environment to create workflows across multiple robotic devices and
   lastly (c) robot co-workers to download and execute the workflow code in
   a local environment with digital twins or real robots. Additionally
   skills and workflows can be shared across organisations. Initial user
   studies have shown that the visual programming environment is accessible
   and the defined skill-set is easy to understand even for domain experts

Year = {2023},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Robots are a popular and engaging educational tool for teaching
   computational thinking, but they often have significant costs and
   limitations for classroom use. Switching to a simulated environment can
   eliminate many of these difficulties. By also providing students with a
   block-based programming environment, the barrier to entry can be further
   reduced. This paper presents a networked virtual robotics platform
   designed to create an environment which is highly accessible for novice
   students and their teachers alike, along with components of a curriculum
   designed to teach computational thinking skills through robotics
   programming challenges, including autonomous challenges and in-class
   competitions. Students access this platform through an extension of the
   same web interface used for programming their robots, which allows
   students to collaborate on code and view a shared simulated virtual
   space. Previously, this virtual robotics platform was used only to
   facilitate distance education. This paper demonstrates its use in an
   in-person class during the Spring 2022 semester, illustrating the
   affordances of a virtual robotics environment for face-to-face learning
   contexts as well. Students' computational thinking skills were evaluated
   with assessments both before and after the class, along with surveys and
   interviews given to determine their opinions and outlooks regarding
   computer science. The results show that students had a significant
   improvement in both attitudes and aptitudes.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},

Month = {JAN 18},
Abstract = {There has been substantial research undertaken on the integration of
   computational thinking (CT) in K-12 mathematics education in recent
   years, particularly since 2018 when relevant systematic reviews were
   conducted on the topic. Many empirical studies in this area have yet to
   elaborate clearly and explicitly on how CT may support mathematics
   learning, or otherwise, in CT-based mathematics activities. Addressing
   this research gap, we conducted a systematic review on the integration
   of CT in K-12 mathematics education with a focus on CT-based mathematics
   instruction and students learning under such instruction. The Web of
   Science database was searched for in terms of studies published from
   2006 to 2021, from which 24 articles were selected to provide
   illustrations of CT-based mathematics instruction and related student
   learning, and they were further analyzed according to education levels
   and contexts, programming tools, learning outcomes in CT and
   mathematics, and the mutual relationship between CT and mathematics
   learning. Among the results, this review found that geometrized
   programming and student-centered instructional approaches were
   facilitators of productive learning in CT and mathematics. Moreover,
   CT-based mathematics learning entails an interactive and cyclical
   process of reasoning mathematically and reasoning computationally, which
   can occur when: (1) applying mathematics to construct CT artefacts; (2)
   applying mathematics to anticipate and interpret CT outputs; and (3)
   generating new mathematical knowledge in parallel with the development
   of CT. The findings contribute to an in-depth understanding of what, and
   how, CT-based mathematics instruction impacts student learning in K-12
   contexts.},

Abstract = {The evolution of IoT has revolutionized industrial automation.
   Industrial devices at every level such as field devices, control
   devices, enterprise level devices etc., are connected to the Internet,
   where they can be accessed easily. It has significantly changed the way
   applications are developed on the industrial automation systems. It led
   to the paradigm shift where novel IoT application development tools such
   as Node-RED can be used to develop complex industrial applications as
   IoT orchestrations. However, in the current state, these applications
   are bound strictly to devices from specific vendors and ecosystems. They
   cannot be re-used with devices from other vendors and platforms, since
   the applications are not semantically interoperable. For this purpose,
   it is desirable to use platform-independent, vendor-neutral application
   templates for common automation tasks. However, in the current state in
   Node-RED such reusable and interoperable application templates cannot be
   developed. The interoperability problem at the data level can be
   addressed in IoT, using Semantic Web (SW) technologies. However, for an
   industrial engineer or an IoT application developer, SW technologies are
   not very easy to use. In order to enable efficient use of SW
   technologies to create interoperable IoT applications, novel IoT tools
   are required. For this purpose, in this paper we propose a novel
   semantic extension to the widely used Node-RED tool by introducing
   semantic definitions such as iot.schema.org semantic models into
   Node-RED. The tool guides a non-expert in semantic technologies such as
   a device vendor, a machine builder to configure the semantics of a
   device consistently. Moreover, it also enables an engineer, IoT
   application developer to design and develop semantically interoperable
   IoT applications with minimal effort. Our approach accelerates the
   application development process by introducing novel semantic
   application templates called Recipes in Node-RED. Using Recipes, complex
   application development tasks such as skill matching between Recipes and
   existing things can be automated. We will present the approach to
   perform automated skill matching on the Cloud or on the Edge of an
   automation system. We performed quantitative and qualitative evaluation
   of our approach to test the feasibility and scalability of the approach
   in real world scenarios. The results of the evaluation are presented and
   discussed in the paper.},

Title = {Developing a Web-based tourism demand forecasting system},
Journal = {TOURISM ECONOMICS},

Volume = {14},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Tourism demand is the foundation on which all tourism-related business
   decisions ultimately rest and so accurate forecasts of tourism demand
   are crucial for tourism industry practitioners. From the functional
   point of view, a tourism demand forecasting system (TDFS) is a
   forecasting support system capable of providing quantitative tourism
   demand forecasts and allowing users to make their own `what-if' scenario
   forecasts. From the technical point of view, a TDFS is an information
   system consisting of a set of computer-based modules or components that
   support tourism demand forecasting and scenario analysis. This paper
   establishes a widely accessible Web-based TDFS which not only takes
   advantage of advanced econometric tourism demand forecasting techniques
   but also incorporates the real-time judgemental contribution of experts
   in the field. Furthermore, scenario forecasts are permitted within the
   system. Built on Web-based technology, the system provides advanced
   information sharing and communication and brings considerable
   convenience to various stakeholders engaged in tourism demand
   forecasting at different locations. In attempting to generate more
   accurate tourism demand forecasts, the system is designed to incorporate
   a two-stage forecasting methodology, which integrates judgemental
   adjustments with statistically based forecasts. The software
   architecture, detailed components and development environment of the
   Web-based TDFS are described in detail. A three-tiered client-server
   architecture is employed, which offers great flexibility, reusability
   and reliability. The prototype system has been developed and screen
   shots of interaction with the system are presented using Hong Kong
   tourism as an example.},

Abstract = {iMPACT3 (Internet Multimedia Preference Assessment Instrument
   Construction Tool, version 3) is a software development environment that
   helps researchers build Internet-capable multimedia utility elicitation
   software programs. The program is a free, openly accessible Web site
   (http://preferences.ucsd.edu/impact3/asp). To develop a utility
   elicitation software program using iMPACT3, a researcher selects modular
   protocol components from a library and custom tailors the components to
   the details of his or her research protocol. iMPACT3 builds a Web site
   implementing the protocol and downloads it to the researcher's computer.
   In a study of 75 HIV-infected patients, an iMPACT3-generated protocol
   showed substantial evidence of construct validity and good internal
   consistency (logic error rates of 4\% to 10\% and procedural invariance
   error rates of 10\% to 26\%, depending on the elicitation method) but
   only fair 3- to 6-week test-re-test reliability(intraclass correlation
   coefficient = 0.42 to 0.55). Further work may be needed on specific
   utility assessment procedures, but this study's results confirm
   iMPACT3's feasibility in facilitating the collection of health state

Title = {Design for six sigma integrated product development reference model
   through systematic review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LEAN SIX SIGMA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {767-795},
Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to present a systematic review of design for six
   sigma (DFSS) methods applicable to the product development process (PDP)
   of durables goods and identify a research opportunity on the subject
   proposing integration of DFSS and a reference model for the PDP. In this
   way, through the analysis of the theoretical references identified in
   the scientific databases, it was possible to propose a conceptual model
   for the PDP oriented to the DFSS. Design/methodology/approach This paper
   is based on the theoretical framework presented in peer-reviewed
   scientific research papers during the period 2000 to 2018 on the theme
   DFSS applied in the PDP, as well as such as the product development
   tools/techniques and statistics addressed. By means of key words defined
   by the acronyms of DFSS methods (DMADOV, ICOV, DMEDI, IDOV, DDOV, PIDOV,
   DMADIC, DCCDI, DMADV, IDDOV, CDOV and DCOV), DFSS and the acronym DFSS.
   Applying Boolean expression during the conduction of the searches
   through the scientific evidence at the Brazilian scientific database
   platform (Capes database). This database platform is maintained by
   coordination for the improvement of higher education personnel, which
   including Emerald Insight (Emerald), Scopus (Elsevier), Science Direct,
   SpringerLink, Taylor Francis, Scielo (Web of Science), Wiley Online
   Library, Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics), etc. It was obtained, by
   means of the searches, 269 papers related to subject DFSS, of which 18
   papers had been critically selected for the composition of a conceptual
   model for the process of development of product guided to the DFSS.
   Findings This study presents a review of the literature (systematic
   review and content analysis) on DFSS and its effectiveness for the PDP.
   The DFSS methodology is disseminated in the scientific literature
   through a variety of methods that are often mistaken for the six sigma
   methodology - DMAIC, which is directed toward process improvement. The
   PDP integrated with the DFSS concepts contributes to eliminating
   possible failures during the design of a new product, directing to
   reduce costs and improve the quality of the product and process.
   Originality/value Through the systematic review and content analysis, it
   was possible to observe that the DFSS methods applied to product
   development are not related to the PDP reference models available in the
   literature. In this way, the fusion of the concepts of the DFSS methods
   and PDP reference models for the construction and proposition of a
   preliminary conceptual model DFSS oriented to the process of product
   development intends to contribute in the development of new products
   with the reduction of time, reduction of the cost, competitive price and
   consumer satisfaction.},

Abstract = {Primary varicose veins are functionally characterized by venous back-how
   and blood stagnation in the upright position, Dilatation and tortuosity
   pro,ide evidence for progressive venous wall remodelling, with
   disturbance of smooth muscle cell/extracellular matrix organization.
   Affected areas are not uniformly distributed, some areas being
   hypertrophic, whereas others are atrophic or unaffected. In 12 varicose
   veins and ten control veins, the proteolytic enzyme/inhibitor balance
   which may participate in the remodelling of the venous wall was
   investigated. For this purpose, the presence and enzymatic activity of
   matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2,MMP-9), tissue inhibitors of MMPs
   (TIMP-1, TIMP-2), urokinase-type (uPA) and tissue-type (tPA) plasminogen
   activators (PAs), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were
   quantified by western blot and gelatin or plasminogen-casein zymography.
   In addition, MMP-2, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and PAI-l levels were measured by
   ELISA. A high TIMP-1 level and a low MMP-2 level/activity were found in
   varicose veins (p < 0.005), resulting in a three-fold increase in the
   TIMP-1/MMP-2 ratio in varicose versus control veins. Levels of PAs (uPA
   and tPA) as web as PAI-L were both lower in varicose veins (p<0.005),
   with minimal change in the PAI/PA ratio. These results These results
   demonstrate that varicose veins are characterized by a higher than
   normal TIMP/MMP ratio, which may facilitate extracellular matrix
   accumulation in the diseased venous wall. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley

Abstract = {Deep learning and its variant techniques have surpassed classical
   machine algorithms due to their high performance gaining remarkable
   results and are used in a broad range of applications. However, adopting
   deep learning models over the cloud introduces privacy and security
   issues for data owners and model owners, including computational
   inefficiency, expansion in ciphertext, error accumulation, security and
   usability trade-offs, and deep learning model attacks. With homomorphic
   encryption, computations on encrypted data can be performed without
   disclosing its content. This research examines the basic concepts of
   homomorphic encryption limitations, benefits, weaknesses, possible
   applications, and development tools concentrating on neural networks.
   Additionally, we looked at systems that integrate neural networks with
   homomorphic encryption in order to maintain privacy. Furthermore, we
   classify modifications made on neural network models and architectures
   that make them computable via homomorphic encryption and the effect of
   these changes on performance. This paper introduces a thorough review
   focusing on the privacy of homomorphic cryptosystems targeting neural

Abstract = {The Electronic Lung(TM) Device (ELD) is an inhalation simulator designed

   ELD. The validation work shows that respirable particle losses are low
   in the ELD and the particle size and dose results are comparable with
   other in vitro testing methods for DPIs. The performance of Serevent
   Diskus inhaler is evaluated using computer-generated inhalation
   profiles. Comparison with results using a cascade impactor alone, show
   that the ELD itself does not affect the aerosol quality, either in terms
   of emitted dose or fine particle dose and consistent dosing performance
   is achieved over a range of inhalation parameters. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Volume = {9},
Pages = {14181-14202},
Abstract = {Recently many researches have explored the potential of visual
   programming in robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and education.
   However, there is a lack of studies that analyze the recent
   evidence-based visual programming approaches that are applied in several
   domains. This study presents a systematic review to understand, compare,
   and reflect on recent visual programming approaches using twelve
   dimensions: visual programming classification, interaction style, target
   users, domain, platform, empirical evaluation type, test participants'
   type, number of test participants, test participants' programming
   skills, evaluation methods, evaluation measures, and accessibility of
   visual programming tools. The results show that most of the selected
   articles discussed tools that target IoT and education, while other
   fields such as data science, robotics are emerging. Further, most tools
   use abstractions to hide implementation details and use similar
   interaction styles. The predominant platforms for the tools are web and
   mobile, while desktop-based tools are on the decline. Only a few tools
   were evaluated with a formal experiment, whilst the remaining ones were
   evaluated with evaluation studies or informal feedback. Most tools were
   evaluated with students with little to no programming skills. There is a
   lack of emphasis on usability principles in the design stage of the
   tools. Additionally, only one of the tools was evaluated for
   expressiveness. Other areas for exploration include supporting end users
   throughout the life cycle of applications created with the tools,
   studying the impact of tutorials on improving learnability, and
   exploring the potential of machine learning to improve debugging
   solutions developed with visual programming.},

Abstract = {Decision-making is not a trivial process. It involves studying and
   analyzing different alternatives. In addition, it requires defining
   criteria for evaluating the alternatives. A problem arises when
   evaluating criteria that conflict or when dealing with qualitative
   criteria. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a multi-criteria
   decision tool that simplifies the decision-making process. It can
   evaluate both qualitative and quantitative criteria. Moreover, AHP
   justifies the final decision by providing the mathematical reasoning
   behind the judgment. The aim of this research is to evaluate available
   Internet of Things (IoT) databases in an edge/cloud platform by applying
   AHP and to suggest a suitable approach for developing a database
   application. In this study, four alternative database development tools
   are evaluated: DaDaBIK, DataFlex, Oracle Application Express, and
   FileMaker. We define our criteria, explain why they are selected, and
   assign each a weight based on its importance. We then evaluate the
   candidates using the weighted criteria. FileMaker is found to be the

Title = {Big Data-Driven Cognitive Computing System for Optimization of Social
   Media Analytics},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {82215-82226},
Abstract = {The integration of big data analytics and cognitive computing results in
   a new model that can provide the utilization of the most complicated
   advances in industry and its relevant decision-making processes as well
   as resolving failures faced during big data analytics. In E-projects
   portfolio selection (EPPS) problem, big data-driven decision-making has
   a great importance in web development environments. EPPS problem deals
   with choosing a set of the best investment projects on social media such
   that maximum return with minimum risk is achieved. To optimize the EPPS
   problem on social media, this study aims to develop a hybrid fuzzy
   multi-objective optimization algorithm, named as NSGA-III-MOIWO
   encompassing the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III)
   and multi-objective invasive weed optimization (MOIWO) algorithms. The
   objectives are to simultaneously minimize variance, skewness and
   kurtosis as the risk measures and maximize the total expected return. To
   evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid algorithm, the data
   derived from 125 active E-projects in an Iranian web development company
   are analyzed and employed over the period 2014-2018. Finally, the
   obtained experimental results provide the optimal policy based on the
   main limitations of the system and it is demonstrated that the
   NSGA-III-MOIWO outperforms the NSGA-III and MOIWO in finding efficient
   investment boundaries in EPPS problems. Finally, an efficient
   statistical-comparative analysis is performed to test the performance of
   NSGA-III-MOIWO against some well-known multi-objective algorithms.},

Abstract = {With the development of advanced technologies in computer science, such
   as deep learning and transfer learning, the tourism field is facing a
   more intelligent and automated future development environment. In this
   study, an artificial intelligence (AI) framework is developed to
   identify tourism photos without human interaction. Adopting online
   destination photos of Australia as a data source, the results show that
   the model combining a deep convolutional neural network and mixed
   transfer learning achieved the best image identification performance.
   This study identified 25 image classification categories covering all
   the tourism scenes to serve as a foundation for future tourism computer
   vision research. The results indicate that the AI photo identification
   framework is of great benefit for the understanding of projected
   destination images and enhancing tourism experiences. This study
   contributes to the existing literature by introducing an intelligent
   automation framework to big data research in the tourism field, as well
   as by advancing innovative methodologies of online destination image
   analysis. Practically, the proposed framework contributes to the
   marketing and management of smart destinations by offering a

Abstract = {Computing power and molecular simulation methodology have improved
   dramatically over the past decade, and for some systems molecular models
   are reaching a point where they can provide information that approaches
   or surpasses the quality of real experimental data. Molecular simulation
   can also be a potent tool for developing qualitative understanding, and
   this feature suggests widespread use of molecular simulation as a tool
   for teaching. Broader use of molecular simulation for these purposes
   requires tools that promote understanding and application of simulation
   software. We present an ``object-oriented{''} view of molecular
   simulation that can help conceptualize and organize its elements, and
   discuss software development tools that we have constructed that enable
   non-experts in simulation or graphical programming to create instructive
   molecular simulations. We finish with an example of one such simulation

Title = {Diverse Mentoring Connections Across Institutional Boundaries in the
   Biomedical Sciences: Innovative Graph Database Analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {26},
Month = {JUN 17},
Abstract = {Background: With an overarching goal of increasing diversity and
   inclusion in biomedical sciences, the National Research Mentoring
   Network (NRMN) developed a web -based national mentoring platform
   (MyNRMN) that seeks to connect mentors and mentees to support the
   persistence of underrepresented minorities in the biomedical sciences.
   As of May 15, 2024, the MyNRMN platform, which provides mentoring,
   networking, and professional development tools, has facilitated more
   than 12,100 unique mentoring connections between faculty, students, and
   researchers in the biomedical domain. Objective: This study aimed to
   examine the large-scale mentoring connections facilitated by our web
   -based platform between students (mentees) and faculty (mentors) across
   institutional and geographic boundaries. Using an innovative graph
   database, we analyzed diverse mentoring connections between mentors and
   mentees across demographic characteristics in the biomedical sciences.
   Methods: Through the MyNRMN platform, we observed profile data and
   analyzed mentoring connections made between students and faculty across
   institutional boundaries by race, ethnicity, gender, institution type,
   and educational attainment between July 1, 2016, and May 31, 2021.
   Results: In total, there were 15,024 connections with 2222 mentees and
   1652 mentors across 1625 institutions contributing data. Female mentees
   participated in the highest number of connections (3996/6108, 65\%),
   whereas female mentors participated in 58\% (5206/8916) of the
   connections. Black mentees made up 38\% (2297/6108) of the connections,
   whereas White mentors participated in 56\% (5036/8916) of the
   connections. Mentees were predominately from institutions classified as
   Research 1 (R1; doctoral universities-very high research activity) and
   historically Black colleges and universities (556/2222, 25\% and
   307/2222, 14\%, respectively), whereas 31\% (504/1652) of mentors were
   from R1 institutions. Conclusions: To date, the utility of mentoring
   connections across institutions throughout the United States and how
   mentors and mentees are connected is unknown. This study examined these
   connections and the diversity of these connections using an extensive
   web -based mentoring network.},

Journal = {SOFTWARE TESTING VERIFICATION \& RELIABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1-2},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Property-based testing has gained popularity in recent years in many
   areas of software development. The specification of
   assertions/properties helps to understand the semantics of pieces of
   code, and in modern programming environments, it can serve to test the
   program behavior. In this paper an XQuery property-based testing tool is
   presented, which enables to automatically test XQuery programs. The tool
   is able to systematically generate XML instances (i.e., test cases) from
   a given XML schema, and to filter XML instances with input properties
   specified by the programmer. Additionally, the tool automatically checks
   output (respectively, input-output) properties in each output instance
   (respectively, each pair of input-output instances). The tool is able to
   report whether the XQuery program passes the test, that is, if all the
   test cases satisfy the (input-)output property, as well as the number of
   test cases used for testing. In addition, if the XQuery program fails
   the test, the tool shows counterexamples found in the test cases.
   Properties are specified with XQuery Boolean functions, and the testing
   tool has been implemented in XQuery. Additionally, an XQuery path
   validation tool is presented. This tool is able to detect wrong paths in
   XQuery expressions. The path validation tool takes as input an XML
   schema, and it reports those paths on the XQuery program that do not
   match the XML schema. The path validation tool is a complement to the
   testing tool rejecting XQuery programs that do not conform to the XML
   schema. The path validation tool has been also implemented in XQuery.
   Finally, a web tool has been developed enabling to test and validate
   XQuery programs.},

   aggression, which is the reason of emergence of many social problems,
   particularly among children such as demonstration of aggressive behavior
   and bullying at home, school and public places. The research work
   reports performance of machine learning classifiers that were applied on
   video transcripts of YouTube videos to detect aggression. The dataset
   constructed for the purpose of research work, consists of English video
   scenes transcripts that were collected from the web and were annotated
   manually as violent and non-violent. Various experiments were performed
   on the dataset using different machine learning (ML) classifiers with
   different text preprocessing settings in RapidMiner and Python
   environments and thus predictive classifier models were constructed and
   tested. In RapidMiner environment, the SVM classifier model outperformed
   the other classifiers achieving highest accuracy of 79\% after
   preprocessing step of removal of stop words. In Python programming
   environment, NB classifier outperformed the other classifiers in
   majority of experiments with different preprocessing settings, achieving
   highest accuracy of 82.5\%, when stemming was performed in preprocessing
   stage along with other preprocessing steps. The automatic process of
   aggression detection in video scenes can be used by concerned
   authorities to enforce their cultural priorities.},

Abstract = {Hands-on computing has emerged as an exciting and accessible way to
   learn about computing and engineering in the physical world for students
   and makers of all ages. Current end-to-end approaches like Microsoft
   MakeCode require tethered or battery-powered devices like a micro:bit,
   limiting usefulness and applicability, as well as abdicating
   responsibility for teaching sustainable practices. Unfortunately, energy
   harvesting computing devices are usually only programmable by experts
   and require significant supporting toolchains and knowledge across
   multiple engineering and computing disciplines to work effectively. This
   paper bridges the gap between sustainable computing efforts, the maker
   movement, and novice-focused programming environments with
   MakeCode-Iceberg, a set of compiler extensions to Microsoft's
   open-source MakeCode project. The extensions automatically and invisibly
   transform user code in any language supported (Blocks, JavaScript,
   Python)into a version that can safely and correctly execute across
   intermittent power failures caused by unreliable energy harvesting.
   Determining where, when, and what to save in a checkpoint on limited
   energy, time, and hardware budget is challenging. We leverage the unique
   intermediate representation of the MakeCode source-to-source compiler to
   design and deploy various checkpointing techniques. Our approach allows
   us to provide, for the first time, a fully web-based and toolchain-free
   environment to program intermittent computing devices, making
   battery-free operation accessible to all. We demonstrate new use cases
   with multiple energy harvesters, peripherals, and application domains:
   including a Smart Terrarium, Step Counter, and Combination Lock.
   MakeCode-Iceberg provides sustainable hands-on computing opportunities
   to a broad audience of makers and learners, democratizing access to
   energy harvesting and battery-free embedded systems.},

Pages = {6045-6051},
Abstract = {This paper proposes an online algorithm for identifying the nonlinear
   dynamical systems and is termed as neo-fuzzy based brain emotional
   learning plant identifier (NFBELPI). As the name suggests, the proposed
   identifier is a combination of brain emotional learning network and
   neo-fuzzy neurons. The integration of these two networks is realized in
   a way that retains the characteristics of both the networks while an
   enhanced performance is achieved at the same time. Precisely, the
   orbitofrontal cortex section of the brain emotional learning network is
   fused with neo-fuzzy neurons with a view to equip it with more knowledge
   than does the amygdala section possesses. The proposed identifier
   accepts n-input and m-output samples to generate an estimate of the
   plant output and employs a brain emotional learning algorithm to lower
   the estimation error by adjusting a total of ((n + m + 1) x p) + ( n + m
   + 2) weights, with p being the number of neo-fuzzy neurons. The proposal
   is validated in aMATLAB programming environment using a simulated
   Narendra dynamical plant as well as against the data recorded from real
   forced duffing oscillator. Comparison with a brain emotional learning
   plant identifier (BELPI) and some other state-of-the art identifiers in
   terms of root mean squared error (RMSE) criterion reveals the improved
   performance of the proposed identifier.},

Abstract = {Making further advances in such diverse problems as building more
   powerful computers, measuring material properties of biological samples,
   or exploring fundamental physical laws on the atomic level requires
   gaining access to the nanoworld. The nanoManipulator system adds a
   virtual-reality interface to an atomic-force microscope (AFM), thus
   providing a tool that can be used by scientists to image and manipulate
   nanometer-sized molecular structures in a controlled manner. As the AFM
   tip scans the sample, the tip-sample interaction forces are monitored,
   which. in turn, can yield information about the frictional, mechanical,
   material, and topological properties of the sample. Computer graphics
   are used to reconstruct the surface for the user, with color or contours
   overlaid to indicate additional data sets. Moreover, a force feedback
   stylus, which is connected to the tip via software, allows the user to
   directly interact with the macromolecules. This system is being used to
   investigate carbon nanotubes (CNT's), deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA),
   fibrin, adeno-and tobacco mosaic virus. Nanotubes have been bent,
   translated, and rotated to understand their mechanical properties and to
   investigate friction on the molecular level. Using AFM lithography in
   combination with the nanoManipulator, the electromechanical properties
   of CNT's ale being investigated. The rupture forces of DNA and fibrin
   fibers have been measured and the elastic moduli of viruses are being
   studied. It is now also possible to insert this system into a scanning
   electron microscope which pro,ides the user with continuous images of
   the sample, even while the AFM tip is being used for manipulations.
   Investigators are invited to apply to use the system as described on the
   web at http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/nano/doc/biovisit.html.},

Abstract = {Recently, metropolitan and access communication networks have markedly
   developed by utilizing a variety of technologies. Their bearer
   communication infrastructures will be mostly exploiting the optical
   transmission medium where wavelength division multiplexing techniques
   will play an important role. This contribution discusses the symmetric
   sharing of common optical network resources in wavelength and time
   domains. Wavelength-Division Multiplexed Passive Optical Networks
   (WDM-PON) attract considerable attention regarding the next generation
   of optical metropolitan and access networks. The main purpose of this
   contribution is presented by the analysis of possible scheduling of
   wavelengths for our novel hybrid network topologies considered for
   WDM-PON networks. This contribution briefly deploys adequate Dynamic
   Wavelength Allocation (DWA) algorithms for selected WDM-PON network
   designs with the provision of traffic protection when only passive
   optical components in remote nodes are utilized. The main part of this
   study is focused on the use of wavelength scheduling methods for
   selected WDM-PON network designs. For evaluation of offline and online
   wavelength scheduling for novel hybrid network topologies, a simulation
   model realized in the Matlab programming environment allows to analyze
   interactions between various metropolitan and access parts in the
   Optical Distribution Network (ODN) related to advanced WDM-PON network
   designs. Finally, wavelength scheduling methods are compared from a

Abstract = {Geoportals have been the primary source of spatial information to
   researchers in diverse fields. Recent years have seen a growing trend to
   integrate spatial analysis and geovisual analytics inside Geoportals.
   Researchers could use the Geoportal to conduct basic analysis without
   offline processing. In practice, domain-specific analysis often requires
   researchers to integrate heterogeneous data sources, leverage new
   statistical models, or build their own customized models. These tasks
   are increasingly being tackled with open source tools in programming
   languages such as Python or R. However, it is unrealistic to incorporate
   the numerous open source tools in a Geoportal platform for data
   processing and analysis. This work provides an exploratory effort to
   bridge Geoportals and open source tools through Python scripting. The
   Geoportal demonstrated in this work is the Urban and Regional Explorer
   for China studies. A python package is provided to manipulate this
   platform in the local programming environment. The server side of the
   Geoportal implements a set of service endpoints that allows the package
   to upload, transform, and process user data and seamlessly integrate
   them into the existing datasets. A case study is provided that
   illustrated the use of this package to conduct integrated analyses of
   search engine data and baseline census data. This work attempts a new
   direction in Geoportal development, which could further promote the
   transformation of Geoportals into online analytical workbenches.},

Year = {2003},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {226-237},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {With the rapid development of e-commerce, there is an immediate need for
   an autonomous and robust system that can offer decision-making support
   for customers who are looking for the cheapest, the most familiar, or
   the best-quality product. This paper presents an agent-based web-mining
   approach to Internet shopping. In contrast to the traditional multiagent
   systems, which use rule-based or case-based process flows to coordinate
   communications for system automation, we propose a fuzzy neural network
   to tackle the uncertainties in practical shopping activities, such as
   consumer preferences, product specification, product selection, price
   negotiation, purchase, delivery, after-sales service and evaluation. The
   fuzzy neural network provides an automatic and autonomous product
   classification and selection scheme to support fuzzy decision making by
   integrating fuzzy logic technology and the back propagation feed forward
   neural network. In addition, a new visual data model is introduced to
   overcome the limitations of the current web browsers that lack
   flexibility for customers to view products from different perspectives.
   Such a model also extends the conventional data warehouse schema to deal
   with intensive data volumes and complex transformations with a high
   degree of flexibility for multiperspective visualization and morphing
   capability in an interactive environment. Furthermore, an agent
   development tool named ``Aglet{''} is used as a programming framework
   for system implementation. The integration of dynamic object
   visualization, interactive user interface and data mining decision
   support provides an effective technique to close the gap between the
   ``real world{''} and the ``cyber world{''} from a business perspective.
   The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed
   approach for web-based business transactions.},

Abstract = {Glutaraldehyde (GA) has been cleared by the Center for Devices and
   Radiological Health (CDRH) of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as
   a high-level disinfectant for disinfecting heat-sensitive medical
   equipment in hospitals and healthcare facilities. Inhalation exposure to
   GA is known to cause respiratory irritation and sensitization in animals
   and humans. To reproduce some of the known in vivo effects elicited by
   GA, we used a liquid aerosol exposure system and evaluated the tissue
   responses in a human in vitro airway epithelial tissue model. The
   cultures were treated at the air interface with various concentrations
   of GA aerosols on five consecutive days and changes in tissue function
   and structure were evaluated at select timepoints during the treatment
   phase and after a 7-day recovery period. Exposure to GA aerosols caused
   oxidative stress, inhibition of ciliary beating frequency, aberrant
   mucin production, and disturbance of cytokine and matrix
   metalloproteinase secretion, as well as morphological transformation.
   Some effects, such as those on goblet cells and ciliated cells,
   persisted following the 7-day recovery period. Of note, the functional
   and structural disturbances observed in GA-treated cultures resemble
   those found in ortho-phthaldehyde (OPA)-treated cultures. Furthermore,
   our in vitro findings on GA toxicity partially and qualitatively
   mimicked those reported in the animal and human survey studies. Taken
   together, observations from this study demonstrate that the human
   air-liquid-interface (ALI) airway tissue model, integrated with an in
   vitro exposure system that simulates human inhalation exposure, could be
   used for in vitro-based human hazard identification and the risk
   characterization of aerosolized chemicals.},

   and a state-of-the-art bin-resolved scheme with explicit treatments of
   liquid and aerosol. The Factorial Method is employed to quantify and
   compare the sensitivities of each scheme under a set of controlled
   conditions, in order to isolate the effect of additional microphysical
   complexity in terms of the impact on surface precipitation. At
   relatively low updraught speeds, the sensitivity of the bulk schemes was
   found to depend on the assumptions made with regards the treatment of
   droplet activation. It was possible to achieve a much closer agreement
   between the single and dual moment bulk schemes by tuning the specified
   droplet number concentration in the single moment scheme, suggesting
   that a diagnostic representation of droplet number may be an acceptable
   alternative to the more expensive prognostic option. However the effect
   of changes in CCN concentration were found to produce a relatively
   stronger effect on precipitation in the bulk schemes compared to the bin
   scheme; this is believed to be a consequence of differences in the
   treatment of drop growth by collision and coalescence. Collectively,
   these results demonstrate the usefulness of the Factorial Method as a
   model development tool for quantitatively comparing and contrasting the
   behaviour of microphysics schemes of differing levels of complexity
   within a specified parameter space.},

Abstract = {A Summary: The human karyotype has been used as a mechanism for
   describing and detecting gross abnormalities in the genome for many
   decades. It is used both for routine diagnostic purposes and for
   research to further our understanding of the causes of disease. Despite
   these important applications there has been no rigorous computational
   representation of the karyotype; rather an informal, string-based
   representation is used, making it hard to check, organize and search
   data of this form. In this article, we describe our use of OWL, the
   Ontology Web Language, to generate a fully computational representation
   of the karyotype; the development of this ontology represents a
   significant advance from the traditional bioinformatics use for tagging
   and navigation and has necessitated the development of a new ontology
   development environment called Tawny-OWL.},

Title = {Vnode: Low-Overhead Transparent Tracing of Node.js-Based Microservice
   Architectures},
Journal = {FUTURE INTERNET},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Tracing serves as a key method for evaluating the performance of
   microservices-based architectures, which are renowned for their
   scalability, resource efficiency, and high availability. Despite their
   advantages, these architectures often pose unique debugging challenges
   that necessitate trade-offs, including the burden of instrumentation
   overhead. With Node.js emerging as a leading development environment
   recognized for its rapidly growing ecosystem, there is a pressing need
   for innovative performance debugging approaches that reduce the
   telemetry data collection efforts and the overhead incurred by the
   environment's instrumentation. In response, we introduce a new approach
   designed for transparent tracing and performance debugging of
   microservices in cloud settings. This approach is centered around our
   newly developed Internal Transparent Tracing and Context Reconstruction
   (ITTCR) technique. ITTCR is adept at correlating internal metrics from
   various distributed trace files to reconstruct the intricate execution
   contexts of microservices operating in a Node.js environment. Our method
   achieves transparency by directly instrumenting the Node.js virtual
   machine, enabling the collection and analysis of trace events in a
   transparent manner. This process facilitates the creation of
   visualization tools, enhancing the understanding and analysis of
   microservice performance in cloud environments. Compared to other
   methods, our approach incurs an overhead of approximately 5\% on the
   system for the trace collection infrastructure while exhibiting minimal
   utilization of system resources during analysis execution. Experiments
   demonstrate that our technique scales well with very large trace files
   containing huge numbers of events and performs analyses in very
   acceptable timeframes.},

Abstract = {In this study, based on the analysis of the dynamic nature of
   collaborative design process, a new framework of collaborative design
   for modelling an immersive VR automotive driving learning (imseADL)
   platform is described. This framework adopts an agent-based approach and
   relocates designers, system and the supporting agents in a unified
   knowledge representation scheme for imseADL design. This study presents
   the research issues and industrial requirements for such a system.
   Furthermore, a prototype system of the proposed framework is implemented
   and its feasibility is evaluated using a real design scenario whose
   objective is designing an imseADL. In this system, each virtual element
   or assembly is designed as an independent unit. The unit agent method is
   used as the basic system modules. To manage these unit agents, a
   web-based interface manager is provided. The scene explorer is a virtual
   element design space based on unit agents and the interface manager. To
   manage the collaborative session, a web-based design phase manager is
   proposed. In this situation, designers do not possess all the knowledge
   they need but instead rely on other organisations. In addition, this
   proposed system is an effective and valuable architecture for
   collaboration design in today's product development environment.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {A new generation of data parallel languages have been proposed whereby a
   user specifies how data structures are to be distributed amongst the
   processor nodes of a distributed-memory machine. Based on this
   information, the compiler then generates code for the parallel
   application. Although this approach significantly simplifies the
   development of the initial version of a parallel application, selection
   of good data distributions leading to efficient computations is often
   quite difficult. Therefore, performance debuggers are needed to yield
   insights into the data distribution effects. On the other hand, most of
   the existing approaches to performance debugging are very general and
   thus do not provide the user feedback in terms of the high level
   programming model or the source code of the parallel application. In
   this paper, we describe a novel approach to performance debugging of
   data parallel programs. The design and implementation of a visual
   performance debugger is described that is specifically targeted to meet
   the performance debugging requirements of a data-parallel programming
   model based on user-specified data distributions. The performance
   debugger is part of an integrated programming environment, called EPPP,
   which also supports a data parallel compiler and a parallel architecture
   simulator. Thus development and performance debugging of an application
   may be done either on the real hardware or by using the simulator. The
   code for EPPP can be obtained free of cost (contact web address,

Abstract = {This review discusses the most current developments and future
   perspectives in enzymatic and non-enzymatic glucose sensors, which have
   notably evolved over the preceding quadrennial period. Furthermore, a
   thorough exploration encompassed the sensor's intricate fabrication
   processes, the diverse range of materials employed, the underlying
   principles of detection, and an in-depth assessment of the sensors'
   efficacy in detecting glucose levels within essential bodily fluids such
   as human blood serums, urine, saliva, and interstitial fluids. It is
   worth noting that the accurate quantification of glucose concentrations
   within human blood has been effectively achieved by utilizing classical
   enzymatic sensors harmoniously integrated with optical and
   electrochemical transduction mechanisms. Monitoring glucose levels in
   various mediums has attracted exceptional attention from industrial to
   academic researchers for diabetes management, food quality control,
   clinical medicine, and bio-process inspection. There has been an
   enormous demand for the creation of novel glucose sensors over the past
   ten years. Research has primarily concentrated on succeeding
   biocompatible and enhanced sensing abilities related to the present
   technologies, offering innovative avenues for more effective glucose
   sensors. Recent de-velopments in wearable optical and electrochemical
   sensors with low cost, high stability, point-of-care testing, and online
   tracking of glucose concentration levels in biological fluids can aid in
   managing and controlling diabetes globally. New nanomaterials and
   biomolecules that can be used in electrochemical sensor systems to
   identify glucose concentration levels are developed thanks to advances
   in nanoscience and nanotechnology. Both enzymatic and non-enzymatic
   glucose electrochemical sensors have garnered much interest recently and
   have made significant strides in detecting glucose levels. In this
   review, we summarise several categories of non -enzymatic glucose sensor
   materials, including composites, non-precious transition metals and
   their metal ox-ides, hydroxides, precious metals and their alloys,
   carbon-based materials, conducting polymers, metal-organic framework
   (MOF)-based electrocatalysts, and wearable device-based glucose sensors

Abstract = {Background and aims: Gestational diabetes has serious short and
   long-term consequences for both mother and child. Designing a standard
   data set and implementing a recall registry system provides
   opportunities for early interventions in women with a history of
   gestational diabetes. The present study aims to draft a data set for the
   gestational diabetes recall registry and its establishment in urban
   health centers.
   Methods: To design a data set for gestational diabetes postpartum recall
   registry a qualitative study has been done from April to June of 2019.
   In this stage, Information need assessment, Identification of data
   elements, development of registry software, and field-testing were done.
   Web-based software was designed in NET language and using a Visual
   Studio programming environment. Implementation of the postpartum recall
   registry was started in 6 health centers of Ahvaz city from August 2019.
   Results: During six months 163 women with gestational diabetes in
   current pregnancy were registered. The final data set for the postpartum
   recall registry included six main groups, 23 subclasses, and 188 data
   elements. Mandatory data were included 115 elements.
   Conclusion: A data set was finalized using a standard method and
   implemented in urban health centers for six months. Implementing a
   postpartum registry with standard elements can help manage data and plan
   for future interventions to reduce modifiable risk factors in this
   population. (C) 2020 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {ANNALS OF HEPATOLOGY},

Volume = {12},

Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Introduction. Poor adherence to treatment for various chronic diseases
   is a frequent phenomenon. Current guidelines for the treatment of
   chronic hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) recommend optimal
   adherence, since it has been suggested that poor adherence is associated
   with an increased risk of virological failure. We aimed to give an
   overview of studies exploring adherence to combination treatment
   (PEG-interferon plus ribavirin) for HCV and nucleos(t)ide analogues for
   HBV. Material and methods. A systematic review Was conducted using the
   databases PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Knowledge. Search
   terms included ``adherence{''} or ``compliance{''} combined with
   ``hepatitis B{''}, ``hepatitis C{''} or ``viral hepatitis{''}. Results.
   The final selection included 19 studies (13 HCV, 6 HBV). Large
   differences in patient numbers and adherence assessment methods were
   found between the various studies. For HCV mean adherence varied from 27
   to 97\%, whereas the proportion of patients with >= 80\% adherence
   varied from 27 to 96\%. Mean adherence reported in HBV studies ranged
   from 81 to 99\%, with 66 to 92\% of patients being 100\% adherent. For
   both HCV and HBV studies, the highest adherence rates were reported in
   studies using self-report whereas lower adherence rates were reported in
   studies using pharmacy claims. Poor adherence to treatment was
   associated with an increased risk of virological failure. Conclusion.
   Non-adherence to treatment in chronic viral hepatitis is not a frequent
   phenomenon. However, given the increased risk of virological failure in
   poorly adherent patients, clinicians should routinely address adherence
   issues in all patients treated for chronic viral hepatitis.},

Abstract = {JTEKT CORPORATION is an automobile parts and machine tools manufacturer
   that sells steering systems, bearings, and driveline components
   worldwide that help to improve fuel efficiency. Electrification of these
   products has been accelerating, and JTEKT has focused on developing
   technologies to further contribute to compact, lightweight, and
   high-efficiency vehicles that are even more energy efficient.
   Electrification of automotive products is also steadily expanding in
   emerging markets. In particular, there are urgent demands to overcome
   such technical challenges as developing low-cost and ultra-lightweight
   electronic components that can operate in harsh conditions. Thus, while
   ensuring greater reliability in products than that conventionally
   achieved, JTEKT is working to quickly develop high-performance, highly
   functional car electronics. To achieve this, it has introduced the
   Flexible Technical Computing Platform (FTCP), a general design and
   development environment that utilizes Fujitsu's Engineering Cloud, and
   is using it to construct its own development platform. This paper
   introduces the steps taken by JTEKT to construct this platform for use
   in developing car electronics.},

Title = {Current Status of Awake Spine Surgery: A Bibliometric Analysis},
Journal = {WORLD NEUROSURGERY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {187},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {- BACKGROUND: Spine surgery accounts for a large proportion of
   neurosurgical procedures, with approximately 313 million spine surgeries
   conducted annually worldwide. Considering delayed recovery and
   postoperative complications that are commonly reported, there has been a
   recent shift toward minimally invasive spine procedures conducted under
   local anesthesia. Despite proven success, there exists a limited body of
   literature on the use of awake surgery in spinal procedures.- METHODS: A
   bibliometric analysis was conducted to map the current landscape of work
   in this field. 190 articles were identified from the Web of Science
   (Clarivate, NY) database. A comprehensive bibliometric analysis was
   performed on a narrowed list of the most relevant articles using
   Bibliometrix, an R-based programming tool.- RESULTS: There has been a
   rise in academic papers published on the topic of awake spine surgery
   since 2016, with an increase in publication count by approximately 18\%
   annually and each article cited approximately ten times on average to
   date. The year 2022 saw an uptick in publications, with 9 throughout the
   entire year. The most impactful article, with a total of 95 citations,
   was published by Sairyo et al. 1 Thematic analysis revealed that the
   terms ``lumbar spine `` and ``stenosis `` are well-developed topics in
   the literature, whereas the topics of ``complications, `` ``fusion, ``
   and ``cost-analysis `` are less well-developed topics.- CONCLUSIONS:
   This study provides a comprehensive overview of the mostcited articles
   in the field of awake spine surgery. Specifically, it identifies areas
   that are well represented in the literature and those which are
   underrepresented and should be areas of continued future research.},

Abstract = {Non-indigenous species (NIS) can alter food web structure and function
   in many ways. While the predatory and competitive roles of NIS in
   aquatic environments are commonly studied, their role as a prey item for
   native predators is often overlooked. As the northern Baltic Sea lacks
   native crabs, the omnivorous estuarine Harris mud crab (Rhithropanopeus
   harrisii) is a novel invader to the system and provides an opportunity
   to observe how the species enters the prey field of predatory fish. In
   fall 2013, 1185 stomachs from 17 fish species were dissected and
   analyzed for the presence of R. harrisii. Fishermen had previously
   reported finding crabs mostly in the stomachs of perch (Perca
   fluviatilis), a frequent catch in recreational and commercial fisheries,
   but our study also found large numbers of crabs in four-horned sculpins
   (Myoxocephalus quadricornis) and small numbers in other species'
   stomachs (Rutilus rutilus, Leuciscus ide, Gymnocephalus cernuus, and
   Blicca bjoerkna). In the study area occupied by R. harrisii, four-horned
   sculpins were the most frequent predator, with 83\% having at least one
   crab in their stomach. In comparison, 7\% of perch and roach had
   consumed R. harrisii. Most crabs eaten were 10-12 mm (carapace width),
   despite broader size range available (1-26 mm). Predation on R. harrisii
   in this system may be limited by the predators' gape size (i.e.,
   physical feeding restriction). These results highlight the need to
   understand the role of novel invasive species as prey items for native
   species, ultimately increase understanding of whether native predators
   can control NIS populations.},

Abstract = {In the pharmaceutical industry, problems like counterfeit drugs,
   including vaccines, and their supply chain management problems like
   transparency, immutability, and traceability exist. In the case of
   vaccines, it becomes more difficult to standardize and detect fake
   vaccines because the public has less awareness and knowledge about
   vaccines. Moreover, the increase in online pharmacies gives more
   opportunities for counterfeiting vaccines to enter the authentic supply
   chain management system. We present transparent, immutable and secure
   vaccine supply chain (TISVSchain), a framework based on blockchain to
   handle the issues of counterfeited vaccines and vaccine supply chain
   problems like transparency, immutability, and traceability. Our proposed
   framework can run both on the private and public blockchain. We have
   implemented the framework on public blockchain by using remix ide and
   the smart contracts designed by solidity language run on very low gas
   cost. We also carried out several experiments by changing the number of
   nodes and their block time to evaluate the performance of our framework
   in terms of transaction per second (TPS), gas cost, and propagation
   delay. Our proposed framework improves the security by using offline
   unique account addresses in blockchain-based frameworks and improves the
   overall efficiency of the framework by keeping the gas cost low, finding
   a way to decrease the number of lost blocks to keep low propagation
   delay, and keeping high TPS value. TISVSchain shows us promising results
   to improve vaccine supply chain management's overall performance,
   security, and efficiency.},

Volume = {29},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Building ontologies in a collaborative and increasingly community-driven
   fashion has become a central paradigm of modern ontology engineering.
   This understanding of ontologies and ontology engineering processes is
   the result of intensive theoretical and empirical research within the
   Semantic Web community, supported by technology developments such as Web
   2.0. Over 6 years after the publication of the first methodology for
   collaborative ontology engineering, it is generally acknowledged that,
   in order to be useful, but also economically feasible, ontologies should
   be developed and maintained in a community-driven manner, with the help
   of fully-fledged environments providing dedicated support for
   collaboration and user participation. Wikis, and similar communication
   and collaboration platforms enabling ontology stakeholders to exchange
   ideas and discuss modeling decisions are probably the most important
   technological components of such environments. In addition,
   process-driven methodologies assist the ontology engineering team
   throughout the ontology life cycle, and provide empirically grounded
   best practices and guidelines for optimizing ontology development
   results in real-world projects. The goal of this article is to analyze
   the state of the art in the field of collaborative ontology engineering.
   We will survey several of the most outstanding methodologies, methods
   and techniques that have emerged in the last years, and present the most
   popular development environments, which can be utilized to carry out, or
   facilitate specific activities within the methodologies. A discussion of
   the open issues identified concludes the survey and provides a roadmap
   for future research and development in this lively and promising field.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {86},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this study was to identify the predictors of
   relapse after the withdrawal of nucleos (t)ide analog (NA) therapy in
   patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative chronic hepatitis B
   (CHB).
   Methods: The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
   Trials, and Web of Science databases were searched through January 2019.
   A random-effects model meta-analysis was performed, with hazard ratios
   (HR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) used as summary statistics.
   Results: Seventeen studies were included in the meta-analysis. Age (HR =
   1.022 per year), baseline hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (HR =
   1.509 per log IU/l), end of treatment (EOT) HBsAg level (HR = 1.896 per
   log IU/l), EOT HBsAg level >= 1000 IU/ml (HR = 1.749), and HBsAg decline
   from baseline to EOT (HR = 0.748 per log IU/l) were associated with
   virological relapse. The predictors of clinical relapse were baseline
   HBsAg level (HR = 1.312 per log IU/l), EOT HBsAg level (HR = 1.458 per
   log IU/l), EOT HBsAg level >= 100 IU/ml (HR = 3.199) or >= 1000 IU/ml
   (HR = 1.810), and duration of consolidation therapy (HR = 0.991 per
   month).
   Conclusions: This meta-analysis indicates that age, the duration of
   consolidation therapy, and levels of baseline and EOT HBsAg were factors
   predictive of relapse in HBeAg-negative CHB patients who discontinued NA
   treatment. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf

Title = {A Hierarchical Region-Merging Algorithm for 3-D Segmentation of
   Individual Trees Using UAV-LiDAR Point Clouds},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {60},
Abstract = {Over an extended period, remote-sensing-based individual tree analysis
   has played a critical role in modern forest inventory and management
   research. The segmentation of individual trees from aerial point clouds
   usually depends on the characteristics of peak-like uplift on the crown
   surface; however, the performance inevitably decreases with increasing
   visibility of such features in point clouds, especially for high-density
   forests. Herein, we developed a novel hierarchical region-merging
   algorithm that first over-segmented the entire forest scene based on
   local density and then merged the over-segmented partitions into pairs
   through a stepwise optimal process to produce the final segmentation. In
   the region-merging method, a global merging cost was introduced to shift
   from local detection of crown features to use the overall compactness of
   forest point clouds. The experiments were conducted using unmanned
   aerial vehicle light detection and ranging (UAV-LiDAR) point clouds from
   three coniferous stands with different densities and a high-density
   coniferous and broad-leaved mixed stand. A total of 5510 field-measured
   trees in 36 plots were used to assess the accuracy of the proposed
   method. Our method achieved F-scores of 0.91, 0.88, 0.84, and 0.80 for
   low- (similar to 700 stems/ha), medium- (similar to 1000 stems/ha), and
   high-density (similar to 2000 stems/ha) conifer stands and coniferous
   and broad-leaved mixed forests (similar to 800 stems/ha), respectively.
   Compared with the classical individual tree segmentation methods
   (marker-controlled watershed segmentation and point cloud region-growing
   algorithm), our method obtained comparable performance in low-density
   conifer stands and superior performance in the other stands.
   Furthermore, the region-merging algorithm could detect 10\% more
   suppressed trees on average, which led to an apparent improvement in
   detection accuracy. The proposed algorithm prop ides a flexible
   segmentation framework that could he further improved by a different
   design that merges costs or applies multiscale segmentation with
   different stopping criteria.},

Abstract = {This study highlights tensions and challenges experienced by language
   teachers in CLIL contexts. Using an example from the Netherlands, it
   explores the pedagogical and collaborative practices of Teachers of
   English in Bilingual streams (TEBs). The study shows how, using formal
   and practical theories (Borg and Burns 2008. ``Integrating Grammar in
   Adult TESOL Classrooms.{''} Applied Linguistics 29 (3): 456-482.
   doi:10.1093/applin/amn020.), pedagogical and collaborative practices
   were formulated and used to investigate the beliefs and practices of
   language teachers in bilingual settings. The paper presents the
   operationalisation of 36 practices for TEBs and reports on an online
   survey investigating TEBs' stated beliefs and practices. The findings
   suggest this set of practices has potential, both as a professional
   development tool for language teachers in bilingual education settings,
   and for further research. Results of the online survey revealed that the
   disciplinary identity of most Dutch TEBs leads to a focus on language,
   communication, literature, and language arts. TEBs are not necessarily
   aware of, and do not automatically consider, possibilities for expanding
   their own pedagogical practices in relation to subject-specific language
   or supporting and collaborating with their subject teacher colleagues.
   We suggest that policy guidelines, curricula development and teacher
   education programmes should pay more attention to the unique position of
   language teachers in these settings.},

   of time series, and in response, there has been increasing interest in
   the creation of time series archives in the past decade, along with the
   development and deployment of novel analysis methods to process the
   data. The general strategy has been to apply a plurality of similarity
   search mechanisms to various subsets and subsequences of time series
   data to identify repeated patterns and anomalies; however, the
   computational demands of these approaches renders them incompatible with
   today's power-constrained embedded CPUs.
   To address this challenge, we present FA-LAMP, an FPGA-accelerated
   implementation of the Learned Approximate Matrix Profile (LAMP)
   algorithm, which predicts the correlation between streaming data sampled
   in real-time and a representative time series dataset used for training.
   FA-LAMP lends itself as a real-time solution for time series analysis
   problems such as classification. We present the implementation of
   FA-LAMP on both edge- and cloud-based prototypes. On the edge devices,
   FA-LAMP integrates accelerated computation as close as possible to IoT
   sensors, thereby eliminating the need to transmit and store data in the
   cloud for posterior analysis. On the cloud-based accelerators, FA-LAMP
   can execute multiple LAMP models on the same board, allowing
   simultaneous processing of incoming data from multiple data sources
   across a network.
   LAMP employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for prediction. This
   work investigates the challenges and limitations of deploying CNNs on
   FPGAs using the Xilinx Deep Learning Processor Unit (DPU) and the Vitis
   AI development environment. We expose several technical limitations of
   the DPU, while providing amechanism to overcome them by attaching custom
   IP block accelerators to the architecture. We evaluate FA-LAMP using a
   low-cost Xilinx Ultra96-V2 FPGA as well as a cloud-based Xilinx Alveo
   U280 accelerator card and measure their performance against a
   prototypical LAMP deployment running on a Raspberry Pi 3, an Edge TPU, a
   GPU, a desktop CPU, and a server-class CPU. In the edge scenario, the
   Ultra96-V2 FPGA improved performance and energy consumption compared to
   the Raspberry Pi; in the cloud scenario, the server CPU and GPU
   outperformed the Alveo U280 accelerator card, while the desktop CPU
   achieved comparable performance; however, the Alveo card offered an
   order of magnitude lower energy consumption compared to the other four
   platforms. Our implementation is publicly available at

Abstract = {That leadership development is a contested terrain, like any
   organizational terrain, can scarcely be considered a new idea, yet
   research into the intricacies of resistance in this context is very much
   in its infancy. This article takes recent critical scholarship on
   resistance as its starting point to explore the interdependencies of
   power, resistance and struggle in a leadership development environment.
   Drawing on extensive online interactions collected from an 18-month,
   cross-sector programme with emergent leaders, this article asks whether
   the different stakeholders in leadership development could benefit from
   a more open exploration of power and resistance. Such dynamics offer new
   insights into the relationship between participants and facilitators and
   raise a series of alternative questions, challenges and strategies for
   leadership development.},

Abstract = {Genetics plays a role in the development of gestational diabetes
   mellitus (GDM), which poses serious risks to pregnant women and their
   children. Several studies have demonstrated a link between GDM
   susceptibility and rs13266634 C/T polymorphism in SLC30A8 gene and
   rs1111875 C/T and rs5015480 C/T, which are located near the linkage
   disequilibrium block containing the IDE, HHEX, and KIF11 genes. However,
   the results are conflicting. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the
   association between susceptibility to GDM and HHEX and SLC30A8 gene
   polymorphisms. PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, CNKI, Wanfang Data, VIP,
   and SCOPUS were used to search for research articles. The quality of the
   selected literature was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. A
   meta-analysis was performed using Stata 15.1. Allelic, dominant,
   recessive, homozygote, and heterozygote models were used for the
   analysis. Nine articles with 15 studies were included. (1) Four studies
   about HHEX rs1111875 showed that the C allele was associated with the
   susceptibility to GDM; (2) three studies on HHEX rs5015480 indicated
   that the C allele in rs5015480 was significantly associated with GDM;
   (3) eight studies about SLC30A8 rs13266634 showed that the C allele was
   significantly associated with the susceptibility to GDM; and (4) a
   subgroup analysis showed that the rs5015480 polymorphism in HHEX and
   rs13266634 polymorphism in SLC30A8 gene were associated with GDM
   susceptibility in Asians. The meta-analysis provided evidence that the C
   allele in rs1111875 and rs5015480 in HHEX and rs13266634 in SLC30A8 can
   increase the risk of GDM.PROSPERO registration number CRD42022342280.},

   BSc theses that have highlighted the potential of such a system, both
   from a didactic and a professional point of view. The main design
   abstractions of the system (i.e., generic sensor configuration, simple
   language with chainable operations for processing data on the edge,
   seamless WiFi/GSM communication) allowed developers to be productive and
   focus on the application requirements and the high-level design choices
   needed to define the edge system (microcontroller and its sensors),
   avoiding the large set-up times necessary to start a solution from
   scratch. The experience also highlighted some usability issues that will

Abstract = {Today, many online companies are gathering information and assembling
   sophisticated databases that know a great deal of information about many
   people, generally without the knowledge of those people. Such endeavor
   has resulted in the unprecedented attrition of individual's right to
   informational self-determination. On the one hand, Consumers are
   powerless to prevent the unauthorized dissemination of their personal
   information, and on the other, they are excluded from its profitable
   commercial exchange. This paper focuses on developing
   knowledge-empowered agent information system for privacy payoff as a
   means of rewarding consumers for sharing their personal information with
   online businesses. The design of this system is driven by the following
   argument: if consumers' personal information is a valuable asset, should
   they not be entitled to benefit from their asset as well? The proposed
   information system is a multi-agent system where several agents employ
   various knowledge and requirements for personal information valuation
   and interaction capabilities that most users cannot do on their own. The
   agents in the information system bear the responsibility of working on
   behalf of consumers to categorize their personal data objects, report to
   consumers on online businesses' trust and reputation, determine the
   value of their compensation using risk-based financial models, and
   finally negotiate for a payoff value in return for the dissemination of
   users' information. The details of the system as well as a
   proof-of-concept implementation using JADE (Java Agent Development
   Environment) are presented here.},

Abstract = {Background The efficacy of nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) in non-cirrhotic
   chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients is well-established. However, their
   impact on complications of portal hypertension in advanced chronic liver
   disease (ACLD) is less well characterized. Methods MEDLINE/PubMed,
   EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials,
   and abstracts of major international hepatology meetings were searched
   for publications from Jan 1, 1995 to Nov 30, 2021. Randomized control
   trials and observational studies reporting the efficacy of NAs in ACLD
   patients were eligible. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) for outcomes of
   interest were calculated with a random-effect or fixed-effect model, as
   appropriate. Results Thirty-nine studies including 14,212 ACLD patients
   were included. NA treatment was associated with reduced risks of overall
   hepatic decompensation events (RR, 0.51; 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI]: 0.37-0.71), such as variceal bleeding (RR, 0.44; 95\% CI:
   0.26-0.74) and ascites (RR, 0.10; 95\% CI: 0.01-1.59), on a trend-wise
   level. Moreover, the risks of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (RR, 0.48;
   95\% CI: 0.30-0.75) and liver transplantation/death (RR, 0.36; 95\% CI:
   0.25-0.53) were also reduced by NA treatment and the first-line NAs were
   superior to non-first-line NAs in improving these outcomes (RR, 0.85;
   95\% CI: 0.75-0.97 and RR, 0.85; 95\% CI: 0.73-0.99, respectively).
   Conclusion NA therapy lowers the risk of portal hypertension-related
   complications, including variceal bleeding, HCC, and liver
   transplantation/death.},

Abstract = {Economic arguments for the adoption of `open source' software in
   business have been widely discussed. In this paper we draw on personal
   experience in the UK, South Africa and Southeast Asia to forward
   compelling reasons why open source software should be considered as an

   dependency on large commercial organisations and proprietary products in
   the field of education.
   The dynamic and responsive nature of `open source' software and the
   existence of freely available documentation and online communities
   offers an opportunity for educators, network administrators and software
   developers to participate in the development of resources appropriate to
   local needs while developing their own skills.
   We identify a range of critical development tools such as Perl and
   Linux, alongside a more specific application, Basic Support for

Abstract = {This paper comprises a SysML-based approach to support the model-driven
   engineering (MDE) of Manufacturing Automation Software Projects (MASP).
   The Systems Modeling Language (SysML) is adapted to define the SysML-AT
   (SysML for automation), a specialized language profile that covers
   (non-)functional requirements, corresponding software applications and
   properties of proprietary hardware components. Furthermore, SysML-AT
   supports an automated software generation for run-time environments
   conforming to IEC 61131-3. A prototypical tool support was realized for
   adapted SysML Parametric Diagrams (PD) inside an industrial automation
   software development tool. Coupling the model editor and online data
   from the provided run-time environment enables direct debugging inside
   the model. The approach was evaluated by several case studies and
   additional usability experiments. With the latter, the suitability of
   the MDE approach for future users was proven. (C) 2014 Published by

Abstract = {Artificial or augmented intelligence, machine learning, and deep
   learning will be an increasingly important part of clinical practice for
   the next generation of radiologists. It is therefore critical that
   radiology residents develop a practical understanding of deep learning
   in medical imaging. Certain aspects of deep learning are not intuitive
   and may be better understood through hands-on experience; however, the
   technical requirements for setting up a programming and computing
   environment for deep learning can pose a high barrier to entry for
   individuals with limited experience in computer programming and limited
   access to GPU-accelerated computing. To address these concerns, we
   implemented an introductory module for deep learning in medical imaging
   within a self-contained, web-hosted development environment. Our initial
   experience established the feasibility of guiding radiology trainees
   through the module within a 45-min period typical of educational
   conferences.},

Abstract = {Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) allow for the building of applications
   that ease the labour of both software engineers and domain experts
   thanks to the level of abstraction they provide. In cases where the
   domain is restricted to Client-Side Web Applications (CSWA), XML-based
   languages, frameworks and widgets are commonly combined in order to
   provide fast, robust and flexible solutions. This article presents an
   approach designed to create XML-based DSL solutions for CSWA that
   includes an evaluation engine, a programming model and a lightweight
   development environment. The approach is able to evaluate multiple
   XML-based DSL programs simultaneously to provide solutions to those
   Domain Specific Problems for CSWAs. To better demonstrate the
   capabilities and potential of this novel approach, we will employ a
   couple of case studies, namely Anisha and FeedPsi. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {An extended implementation of the Mumps language is described that
   facilitates vendor neutral migration of legacy Mumps applications to
   SQL-based relational database servers. Implemented as a compiler, this
   system translates Mumps programs to operating system independent,
   standard C code for subsequent compilation to fully stand-alone, binary
   executables. Added built-in functions and support modules extend the
   native hierarchical Mumps database with access to industry standard,
   networked, relational database management servers (RDBMS) thus freeing
   Mumps applications from dependence upon vendor specific, proprietary,
   unstandardized database models. Unlike Mumps systems that have added
   captive, proprietary RDMBS access, the programs generated by this
   development environment can be used with any RDBMS system that supports
   common network access protocols. Additional features include a built-in
   web server interface and the ability to interoperate directly with
   programs and functions written in other languages.},

Abstract = {With the migration of enterprise applications to microservices and
   containers, cloud service providers, starting with Amazon in 2014,
   announced a new computational model called function-as-a-service. In
   these platforms, developers create a set of fine-grained functions with
   shorter execution times instead of developing coarse-grained software.
   In addition, the management of system resources and servers is delegated
   to cloud service providers. This model has many benefits, such as
   reducing costs, improving resource utilization, and helping developers
   focus on the core logic of applications. But, still faces many
   challenges such as cost/usage balance, optimizing performance,
   programming models, using current development tools, containers' cold
   start problem, saving data in caches, security issues, privacy concerns,
   and scheduling challenges like execution time prediction. In this paper,
   we focus on scheduling and cold start problems. Reducing the cold start
   time can result in better response times and hence a better experience
   for end-users. Compromise occurs when keeping warm operating
   environments which can reduce cold start times while increasing resource
   usage costs. The cold start problem is wildly studied, but in this work,
   we propose a novel dynamic waiting-time adjustment approach in which the
   waiting time of a container will change dynamically according to the
   situation. In this study, four different types of decisions for changing
   the waiting time are introduced and investigated. We aim to create a
   trade-off by using these decisions at runtime using a heuristic method.
   Functions' invocation frequency, function dependency graph, maximum
   merging time, correct mergers, cost, and timeline are considered for the
   decision-making process. The performed evaluations demonstrate that the
   proposed approach results in a 32\% improvement over the fixed-time
   method (i.e., the method used by Apache OpenWhisk). This comparison is
   made from the cumulative measurement viewpoint which is a combination of
   response time, turnaround time, cost, and utilization.},

Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {25},
Number = {5},
Pages = {367-391},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {An important issue for the success of a database application is the
   effectiveness of its interface. Frequently a relevant part of the
   programming effort is devoted to the generation of interfaces. The
   visual programming environments reduce only partly this effort, and in
   particular, things become more complicated when data coming from
   different sources (different views in the same database or even views
   from different databases or systems) are to be related and must
   cooperate in the data navigation and manipulation task. To overcome this
   problem we present a new database access paradigm based on an algebra on
   the domain of computational abstractions called ``services{''} which
   include both dimensions: the data access computation and the user
   interaction. This means that the interaction is not implemented by using
   separated constructs as happens for traditional computational models; on
   the contrary, as the interaction is an integral part of the service
   paradigm, the user interaction is computed starting from the declarative
   specification of the data access itself. The combination of services in
   a service expression through the operators defined by the service
   algebra makes it possible to generate cooperating user interfaces for
   complex data navigation and manipulation. Through algebraic properties,
   which hold both from the data and user interface point of view, the
   service expressions can be simplified and optimized guaranteeing their
   initial semantics. The paper shows the application of the service
   algebra to the relational environment by means of a simple extension to
   SQL. Finally, the paper describes a tool based on a three tier
   architecture and on lava technology for developing and distributing
   services in Web environment. Services and combination of services
   expressed with the service algebra are automatically translated into
   Java objects, allowing the rapid development of platform independent
   data access services. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Abstract = {Accurate and timely weed mapping between and within trees is considered
   one of the major chal-lenges in the site-specific weed management
   systems. This research presents the first cloud com-puting approach
   based on the incorporation of multispectral Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
   (UAV) im-agery in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) programming environment
   with the aim of improving the mapping of weed patches between and within
   trees in a citrus farm. For this purpose, the UAV multispectral bands
   (red, green, blue, near infrared, and red edge), as well as the
   estimated vege-tation height from the UAV Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
   were analysed in terms of tree and weed discrimination and used as input
   into Random Forest (RF) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) machine learning
   algorithms. From the DEM, the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) was estimated
   us-ing the Inverse Distance Weighted Interpolation (IDW) of the
   elevation values of dense points on the soil. The plant height was
   derived by subtracting the DTM from the DEM, resulting in the Canopy
   Height Model (CHM). The experimental results show that: (i) the
   combination of spectral bands and the CHM can classify both trees and
   weeds with an overall accuracy reached 96.87\%; (ii) the RF classifier
   was more robust compared to KNN in the classification performance; (iii)
   when compared to the use of UAV spectral bands, the addition of the CHM
   can improve the accu-racy of crop classification by 13.36\% (KNN) and
   1.79\% (RF). Furthermore, the integration of UAV imagery in the GEE was
   highly efficient in terms of automation of the UAV imagery process-ing.},

Abstract = {Purpose: To investigate communication intervention that speech language

   web-based survey targeting all Swedish SLPs working with people
   currently receiving support from habilitation services. Results: The
   SLPs reportedly followed recommended practice in the following aspects:
   (1) Information on communicative function was collected from several
   sources, including observation in well-known settings and reports from
   the client s social network, (2) Multimodal communication was promoted
   and, (3) Responsive partner strategies were largely targeted in the
   intervention. However, few instruments or standard procedures were used
   and partner instruction was given informally. Most SLPs used
   communication aids in the intervention and their general impression of
   using communication aids was positive. Further, augmentative and
   alternative communication (AAC) was estimated to increase and clarify
   communicative contributions from the person. Conclusions: Communication
   aids were reported to have a positive influence on communicative
   functions. Swedish SLP services followed best practice in several
   aspects, but there are areas with potential for development. Tools and
   best practice guidelines are needed to support SLPs in the AAC process

Abstract = {Biomedical researchers share a common challenge of making complex data
   understandable and accessible as they seek inherent relationships
   between attributes in disparate data types. Data discovery in this

   navigate underlying data models. We have addressed this need by
   developing Harvest, an open-source framework of modular components, and
   using it for the rapid development and deployment of custom data
   discovery software applications. Harvest incorporates visualizations of
   highly dimensional data in a web-based interface that promotes rapid
   exploration and export of any type of biomedical information, without
   exposing researchers to underlying data models. We evaluated Harvest
   with two cases: clinical data from pediatric cardiology and
   demonstration data from the OpenMRS project. Harvest's architecture and
   public open-source code offer a set of rapid application development
   tools to build data discovery applications for domain-specific
   biomedical data repositories. All resources, including the OpenMRS

Abstract = {Knowledge Sharing is a crucial issue in the Semantic Web: SW services
   expose and share knowledge content which arise from distinct languages,
   locales, and personal perspectives; a great effort has been spent in
   these years, in the form of Knowledge Representation standards and
   communication protocols, with the objective of acquiring semantic
   consensus across distributed applications. However, neither ontology
   mapping algorithm nor knowledge mediator agent can easily find a way
   through ontologies as they are organized nowadays: concepts expressed by
   hardly recognizable labels, lexical ambiguity represented by phenomena
   like synonymy and polysemy and use of different natural languages which
   derive from different cultures, all together push for expressing
   ontological content in a linguistically motivated fashion. This paper
   presents our approach in establishing a framework for semi-automatic
   linguistic enrichment of ontologies, which led to the development of
   Ontoling, a plug-in for the popular ontology development tool Protege.
   We describe here its features and design aspects which characterize its

   This study aimed to report (1) a flexible platform to implement and
   optimize neural control of powered lower limb prosthesis and (2) an
   experimental setup and protocol to evaluate neural prosthesis control on
   patients with lower limb amputations. First a platform based on a PC and
   a visual programming environment were developed to implement the
   prosthesis control algorithms, including NMI training algorithm, NMI
   online testing algorithm, and intrinsic control algorithm. To
   demonstrate the function of this platform, in this study the NMI based
   on neuromuscular-mechanical fusion was hierarchically integrated with
   intrinsic control of a prototypical transfemoral prosthesis. One patient
   with a unilateral transfemoral amputation was recruited to evaluate our
   implemented neural controller when performing activities, such as
   standing, level-ground walking, ramp ascent, and ramp descent
   continuously in the laboratory. A novel experimental setup and protocol
   were developed in order to test the new prosthesis control safely and
   efficiently. The presented proof-of-concept platform and experimental
   setup and protocol could aid the future development and application of
   neurally-controlled powered artificial legs.},

Title = {Student perceptions of faculty caring in online nursing education: A
   mixed-methods study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {112},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Background: As the prevalence of online nursing education increased, so
   did the need for faculty to understand student perceptions of faculty
   behaviors that demonstrate caring and promote student success.
   Literature from both education and nursing journals supported this
   study. Objectives: Primary objectives were to identify how the value of
   caring is made visible in online learning, to understand how students
   prioritized faculty caring behaviors and to identify any significant
   differences in per-ceptions related to student demographics. A secondary
   objective was to provide professional development tools for faculty who
   teach nursing students in the online environment. Design: Mixed methods.
   Setting: A College of Nursing within a large public university in the
   Southeastern United States. Participants: One hundred and forty-one
   (141) nursing students pursuing graduate degrees (MSN or DNP)
   participated in the student survey and 15 participated in the focus
   groups/interviews; 28 faculty members responded to the survey. Methods:
   A validated survey tool was used to identify how students prioritized
   faculty caring behaviors. Facilitator-led focus groups were used to gain
   additional insights. Faculty members were surveyed to compare faculty
   and student priorities. Descriptive and correlational analyses were
   performed. Results: Graduate nursing students perceived a course that is
   well-designed, with clear instructions and communication, and a
   supportive environment, to be evidence of faculty caring. There were
   significant differ-ences in student responses when analyzed by
   demographic characteristics such as gender and race. Student perceptions
   aligned with previous research on this topic; faculty and student
   perceptions differed in some areas. Conclusion: Quantifying graduate
   student perceptions about faculty caring behaviors provided information
   that is used for faculty professional development. Further research is
   needed to explore perceptions of faculty caring in different student
   populations. Multi-site studies to explore race and gender differences
   in perception are also recommended.},

Title = {Serious adverse events after cessation of nucleos(t)ide analogues in
   individuals with chronic hepatitis B: A systematic review and
   meta-analysis},
Journal = {JHEP REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background \& Aims: The risk of serious clinical outcomes following
   cessation of nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs) in individuals with chronic
   hepatitis B remains poorly characterized. This systematic review and
   meta-analysis aimed to evaluate current literature on this issue.
   Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for NUC stop
   studies that noted clinical outcomes published between January 1, 2006
   and August 18, 2022. We performed meta-research analyses to examine the
   relationships of reported outcomes with study designs and
   characteristics and also pooled studies with non-overlapping populations
   to provide risk estimates for the proportions of (1) severe hepatitis
   flares or hepatic decompensation or (2) hepatitis flare-related death or
   liver transplantation. Results: The meta-research analysis included 50
   studies of highly heterogeneous designs and characteristics. We found
   that reporting of safety outcomes varied widely according to outcome
   definition, follow-up duration, and sample size. Only ten studies
   prespecified safety events as the study outcome, and only four had an
   outcome definition to include hepatic insufficiency, a follow-up
   duration >12 months, and a sample size >100 patients. We further pooled
   15 studies with 4,525 individuals and estimated that severe hepatitis
   flares or decompensation would occur in 1.21\% (95\% CI 0.70-2.08\%),
   with significant heterogeneity (I2 = 54\%, p <0.01), while hepatitis
   flare-related death or liver transplantation would occur in 0.37\% (95\%
   CI 0.20-0.67\%), without significant heterogeneity (I2 = 0.00\%, p =
   1.00). Conclusions: Current literature on the risk of serious clinical
   outcomes following NUC cessation is very limited and highly
   heterogeneous. Pooled analyses of available data found approximately 1\%
   of patients who stopped NUCs developed severe flares or hepatic
   decompensation. Impact and implications: Current literature regarding
   the safety concerns surrounding NUC cessation for individuals with
   chronic hepatitis B is limited and heterogeneous in designs and
   characteristics, and thus should be interpreted with great caution.
   Based on currently available data, the proportion of patients that
   develop severe hepatitis flares or hepatic decompensation was estimated
   at 1.21\% and that of flare-related death or liver transplantation at
   0.37\%. Our findings are important for individuals receiving
   nucleos(t)ide analogues for hepatitis B virus infection because we not
   only pooled currently available data to estimate the risk of serious
   clinical adverse events following treatment cessation but also uncovered
   critical limitations of existing literature regarding the safety of
   finite therapy. \& COPY; 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Development of Integrated Automatic System of Laser Cladding for
   Repairing of Polycrystalline Diamond Compact Bits},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In order to improve the automatic level for laser-cladding repair of
   high value industrial equipment, such as polycrystalline diamond compact
   bit (PDC bit) applied in oil industry, a universal scheme of integrated
   automatic system for repairing is proposed in this paper, and the basic
   functional modules together with the executing order according to which
   each module runs are defined. There are two main technical points,
   i.e.,inspection and repairing, that need to be realized for such
   integrated automatic system. Therefore, according to the proposed scheme
   and the existing instruments, a dual-robot system, which includes two
   KUKA industrial robots, is adopted as the technological implementation,
   where one robot is used to carry a 3D scanner to reconstruct the PDC bit
   to realize inspection while the other is used to hold the laser to melt
   the special powder flowing to the damaged region of the bit to complete
   cladding. To realize automatic running of the whole integrated system, a
   hand-eye calibration method, namely three-point calibration, is then
   proposed, by which coordinates of point cloud of the damaged PDC bit
   detected by 3D scanner can be transformed to those of the coordinate
   system of the robot with the laser, so that the cladding path planned
   via cutting slice of the damaged region of the PDC bit in the upper
   computer software, the key of the integrated system developed by QT
   programming tool, can be tracked by laser head and then the damaged part
   of the PDC bit can be repaired. Finally, a laser-cladding experiment for
   repairing PDC bit is carried out and the feasibility of the proposed
   scheme of the integrated automatic system and the effectiveness of the
   dual-robot system implemented via KUKA robots are verified, According to
   existing literature, no papers about such integrated system for
   automatic laser cladding repair have been published.},

Journal = {GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {We develop a new large-scale hydrological and water resources model, the
   Community Water Model (CWatM), which can simulate hydrology both
   globally and regionally at different resolutions from 30 arcmin to 30
   arcsec at daily time steps. CWatM is open source in the Python
   programming environment and has a modular structure. It uses global,
   freely available data in the netCDF4 file format for reading, storage,
   and production of data in a compact way. CWatM includes general surface
   and groundwater hydrological processes but also takes into account human
   activities, such as water use and reservoir regulation, by calculating
   water demands, water use, and return flows. Reservoirs and lakes are
   included in the model scheme. CWatM is used in the framework of the
   Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP), which
   compares global model outputs. The flexible model structure allows for
   dynamic interaction with hydro-economic and water quality models for the
   assessment and evaluation of water management options. Furthermore, the
   novelty of CWatM is its combination of state-of-the-art hydrological
   modeling, modular programming, an online user manual and automatic
   source code documentation, global and regional assessments at different
   spatial resolutions, and a potential community to add to, change, and
   expand the open-source project. CWatM also strives to build a community
   learning environment which is able to freely use an open-source
   hydrological model and flexible coupling possibilities to other sectoral
   models, such as energy and agriculture.},

Title = {Sorotoki: A Matlab Toolkit for Design, Modeling, and Control of Soft
   Robots},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {17604-17638},
Abstract = {In this paper, we present Sorotoki, an open-source toolkit in MATLAB
   that offers a comprehensive suite of tools for the design, modeling, and
   control of soft robots. The complexity involved in researching and
   building soft robots often stems from the interconnectedness of design
   and control aspects, which are rarely addressed together as a unified
   problem. To address such complex interdependencies in soft robotics, the
   Sorotoki toolkit provides a comprehensive and modular programming
   environment composed of seven Object-Oriented classes. These classes are
   designed to work together to solve a wide range of soft robotic
   problems, offering versatility and flexibility for its users. We provide
   here a comprehensive overview of the Sorotoki software architecture to
   highlight its usage and applications. The details and interconnections
   of each module are thoroughly described, collectively explaining how to
   gradually introduce modeling complexity for various soft robotic
   scenarios. The effectiveness of Sorotoki is also demonstrated through a
   range of case studies, including novel problem scenarios and established
   works widely recognized in the soft robotics community. These case
   studies cover a broad range of research problems, including: inverse
   design of soft actuators, passive and active soft locomotion, object
   manipulation with soft grippers, meta-materials, model reduction,
   model-based control of soft robots, and online shape estimation.
   Additionally, the toolkit provides access to four open-hardware soft
   robotic systems that can be fabricated using commercially available 3D
   printers. For more information about Sorotoki, readers are encouraged to

Title = {Bayesian parentage analysis with systematic accountability of genotyping
   error, missing data and false matching},
Journal = {BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {29},
Number = {6},
Pages = {725-732},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Motivation: The goal of any parentage analysis is to identify as many
   parent-offspring relationships as possible, while minimizing incorrect
   assignments. Existing methods can achieve these ends, but they require
   additional information in the form of demographic data, thousands of
   markers and/or estimates of genotyping error rates. For many non-model
   systems, it is simply not practical, cost-effective or logistically
   feasible to obtain this information. Here, we develop a Bayesian
   parentage method that only requires the sampled genotypes to account for
   genotyping error, missing data and false matches.
   Results: Extensive testing with microsatellite and SNP datasets reveals
   that our Bayesian parentage method reliably controls for the number of
   false assignments, irrespective of the genotyping error rate. When the
   number of loci is limiting, our approach maximizes the number of correct
   assignments by accounting for the frequencies of shared alleles.
   Comparisons with exclusion and likelihood-based methods on an empirical
   salmon dataset revealed that our Bayesian method had the highest ratio
   of correct to incorrect assignments.
   Availability: Our program SOLOMON is available as an R package from the
   CRAN website. SOLOMON comes with a fully functional graphical user
   interface, requiring no user knowledge about the R programming
   environment. In addition to performing Bayesian parentage analysis,
   SOLOMON includes Mendelian exclusion and a priori power analysis
   modules. Further information and user support can be found at

Journal = {ASIA LIFE SCIENCES},

Pages = {447-458},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Virtual machine is one of the core technologies for mobile, cloud and
   IoT technologies, and its purpose is to provide a platform independent
   runtime environment from the specific hardware. Because a virtual
   machine simplifies the fragmentized complex execution and development
   environments by device types or platform types, and offers consistent
   program development and common execution methods, the use scope of a
   virtual machine becomes wider. Smart Virtual Machine (SVM) is a software
   processor mountable for smart devices and embedded devices, and is a
   core module of smart cross platform to enhance content re-usability by
   providing the independent function of language/platform to users.
   Although, SVM supports programming languages including C/C++, Java and
   Objective C, and various execution environments such as OS and HTML5
   including Android, iOS, Linux and Windows, SVM does not support
   functions like multithread, priority scheduling and thread
   synchronization within the contents. This paper makes thread within
   content possible to be differentially executed by supporting a thread
   priority scheduling function in SVM. Through this, a programmer can use
   multithread that SVM independently provides to a developed language and
   a device. In addition, the SVM preferential occupancy of thread,
   according to importance, has become possible by using priority that can
   be awarded to each thread.},

Title = {Experiential Learning in Biomedical Engineering Education Using Wearable
   Devices: A Case Study in a Biomedical Signals and Systems Analysis
   Course},

Abstract = {Biomedical engineering (BME) is one of the fastest-growing engineering
   fields worldwide. BME professionals are extensively employed in the
   health technology and healthcare industries. Hence, their education must
   prepare them to face the challenge of a rapidly evolving technological
   environment. Biomedical signals and systems analysis is essential to BME
   undergraduate education. Unfortunately, students often underestimate the
   importance of their courses as they do not perceive these courses'
   practical applications in their future professional practice. In this
   study, we propose using blended learning spaces to develop new learning
   experiences in the context of a biomedical signals and systems analysis
   course to enhance students' motivation and interest and the relevance of
   the materials learned. We created a learning experience based on
   wearable devices and cloud-based collaborative development environments
   such that the students turned daily-life scenarios into experiential
   learning spaces. Overall, our results suggest a positive impact on the
   students' perceptions of their learning experience concerning relevance,
   motivation, and interest. Namely, the evidence shows a reduction in the
   variability of such perceptions. However, further research must confirm
   this potential impact. This confirmation is required given the monetary
   and time investment this pedagogical approach would require if it were
   to be implemented at a larger scale.},

Title = {Programming of a flexible computer simulation to visualize

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY AND THERAPEUTICS},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {42},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Teaching pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models can be made more
   effective using computer simulations. We propose the programming of
   educational PK or PK/PD computer simulations as an alternative to the
   use of pre-built simulation software. This approach has the advantage of
   adaptability to non-standard or complicated PK or PK/PD models.
   Simplicity of the programming procedure was achieved by selecting the
   LabVIEW programming environment. An intuitive user interface to
   visualize the time courses of drug concentrations or effects can be
   obtained with pre-built elements. The environment uses a wiring analogy
   that resembles electrical circuit diagrams rather than abstract
   programming code. The goal of high interactivity of the simulation was
   attained by allowing the program to run in continuously repeating loops.
   This makes the program behave flexibly to the user input. The
   programming is described with the aid of a 2-compartment PK simulation.
   Examples of more sophisticated simulation programs are also given where
   the PK/PD simulation shows drug input, concentrations in plasma, and at
   effect site and the effects themselves as a function of time. A
   multicompartmental model of morphine, including metabolite kinetics and
   effects is also included. The programs are available for download from
   the World Wide Web at http:// www.klinik.uni-frankfurt.de/zpharm/kiin/
   PKPDsimulation/content.html. For pharmacokineticists who only program
   occasionally, there is the possibility of building the computer
   simulation, together with the flexible interactive simulation algorithm
   for clinical pharmacological teaching in the field of PK/PD models.},

Pages = {188-196},
Month = {MAR 30},
Abstract = {This paper describes a software package, named sigTOOL, for processing
   biological signals. The package runs in the MATLAB programming
   environment and has been designed to promote the sharing of
   laboratory-developed software across the worldwide web. As
   proof-of-concept of the design of the system, sigTOOL has been used to
   build an analysis application for dealing with neuroscience data
   complete with a user-friendly graphical user interface which implements
   a range of waveform and spike-train analysis functions. The interface
   allows many commonly used neuroscience data file formats to be loaded
   (including those of Alpha Omega, Cambridge Electronic Design,
   Cyberkinetics Inc., Molecular Devices, Nex Technologies and Plexon
   Instruments). Waveform analysis functions selectable from the interface
   support waveform averaging (mean and median), auto- and
   cross-correlation, power spectral analysis, coherence estimation,
   digital filtering (feedback and feedforward) and resampling. Spike-train
   analyses include interspike interval distributions, Poincare plots,
   event auto- and cross-correlations, spike-triggered averaging, stimulus
   driven and phase-related peri-event time histograms and rasters as well
   as frequencygrams. User-developed additions to sigTOOL that are archived
   and distributed electronically will be added to the sigTOOL interface
   on-the-fly, without the need to modify the core sigTOOL code. Full
   sigTOOL functionality will be provided to support the user-developed
   code, including the ability to record a user action history for batch
   processing of files and support for exporting the results of analyses to
   external graphics editing software and spreadsheet-based data processing
   packages. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {TEHNICKI GLASNIK-TECHNICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Modern maintenance strategies, such as predictive and prescriptive
   maintenance, which derived from the concept of Industry and Maintenance
   4.0, involve the application of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
   to connect maintenance objects enabling data collection and analysis
   that can help make better decisions on maintenance activities. Data
   collection is the initial step and the foundation of any modern
   Predictive or Prescriptive maintenance strategy because it collects data
   that can then be analysed to provide useful information about the state
   of maintenance objects. Condition monitoring of rotary equipment is one
   of the most popular maintenance methods because it can distinguish
   machine state between multiple fault types. The topic of this paper is
   the presentation of an automated system for data collection, processing
   and interpretation of rotary equipment state that is based on IIoT
   framework consisting of an IIoT accelerometer, edge and fog devices, web
   API and database. Additionally, ISO 10816-1 guidance has been followed
   to develop module for evaluation of vibration severity. The collected
   data is also visualized in a dashboard in a near-real time and shown to
   maintenance engineering, which is crucial for pattern monitoring. The
   developed system was launched in laboratory conditions using rotating
   equipment failure simulator to test the logic of data collection and
   processing. A proposed system has shown that it is capable of automated
   periodic data collection and processing from remote places which is
   achieved using Node RED programming environment and MQTT communication
   protocol that enables reliable, lightweight, and secure data
   transmission.},

Abstract = {Background Priority of antiviral treatment for patients with chronic
   hepatitis B (CHB) is to increase the probability of functional cure. We
   aimed to synthesize evidence regarding the efficacy of different
   combination strategies of antiviral treatment based on interferon (IFN)
   and nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) in adults with CHB. Methods PubMed,
   Web of Science and Embase databases were searched from inception to May
   26, 2019. Three types of combination strategies were studied: initial
   combination (IFN or NAs monotherapy as control), add-on (I: IFN add-on
   NAs vs. NAs; II: NAs add-on IFN vs. IFN), switch-to (I: IFN switch-to
   NAs vs. IFN; II: NAs switch-to IFN vs. NAs). Results Compared to NAs
   monotherapy, initial combination strategy improved the probability of
   HBeAg loss (RR: 1.62, 95\% CI 1.33-1.97) and HBsAg loss (RR: 15.59, 95\%
   CI 3.22-75.49), while compared to IFN monotherapy, no higher rates in
   the loss of HBsAg or HBeAg for initial combination. Compared to NAs
   monotherapy, IFN add-on NAs strategy had a higher rate of HBsAg loss
   (RR: 4.52, 95\% CI 1.95-10.47), while compared to IFN monotherapy, NAs
   add-on IFN had a similar outcome. Compared to NAs monotherapy, NAs
   switch-to IFN strategy improved HBsAg loss (RR: 12.15, 95\% CI
   3.99-37.01); while compared to IFN monotherapy, IFN switch-to NAs had no
   improved rate of HBsAg clearance but higher rates in undetectable HBV
   DNA, and HBeAg loss. Conclusion IFN add-on NAs, or NAs switched to IFN
   could significantly improve the probability of HBsAg loss compared to
   NAs monotherapy.},

Abstract = {This article describes specific procedures for conducting quality
   assessment of Affymetrix GeneChip soybean genome data and for performing
   analyses to determine differential gene expression using the open-source
   R programming environment in conjunction with the open-source
   Bioconductor software. We describe procedures for extracting those
   Affymetrix probe set IDs related specifically to the soybean genome on
   the Affymetrix soybean chip and demonstrate the use of exploratory plots
   including images of raw probe-level data, boxplots, density plots and M
   versus A plots. RNA degradation and recommended procedures from
   Affymetrix for quality control are discussed. An appropriate probe-level
   model provides an excellent quality assessment tool. To demonstrate
   this, we discuss and display chip pseudo-images of weights, residuals
   and signed residuals and additional probe-level modeling plots that may
   be used to identify aberrant chips. The Robust Multichip Averaging (RMA)
   procedure was used for background correction, normalization and
   summarization of the AffyBatch probe-level data to obtain expression
   level data and to discover differentially expressed genes. Examples of
   boxplots and MA plots are presented for the expression level data.
   Volcano plots and heatmaps are used to demonstrate the use of (log) fold
   changes in conjunction with ordinary and moderated t-statistics for
   determining interesting genes. We show, with real data, how
   implementation of functions in R and Bioconductor successfully
   identified differentially expressed genes that may play a role in
   soybean resistance to a fungal pathogen, Phakopsora pachyrhizi. Complete
   source code for performing all quality assessment and statistical
   procedures may be downloaded from our web source:

Abstract = {We propose a Web service oriented and process-centric framework for
   supporting collaborative engineering services. The proposed approach
   utilizes BPEL-based (Business Process Execution Language) process
   templates and coordination broker-based conversation support, which can
   support long-running engineering transactions, engineering service
   orchestration and choreography, conversation over the process, and
   context-awareness. The process template plays an important role as a
   federation of published engineering services. It is managed and executed
   by a process orchestration and choreography broker, which works as a
   service dispatching and aggregation agent. It is capable of federating
   processes, tools, operations, and knowledge bases into a dynamic and
   collaborative product development environment. The paper also discusses
   how to support collaboration over the running process using conversation
   policy. Further, the paper discusses how to utilize engineering contexts
   in support of querying and reasoning of engineering service-related

Abstract = {OpenModelica is a unique large-scale integrated open-source Modelica-
   and FMI-based modeling, simulation, optimization, model-based analysis
   and development environment. Moreover, the OpenModelica environment
   provides a number of facilities such as debugging; optimization;
   visualization and 3D animation; web-based model editing and simulation;
   scripting from Modelica, Python, Julia, and Matlab; efficient simulation
   and co-simulation of FMI-based models; compilation for embedded systems;
   Modelica-UML integration; requirement verification; and generation of
   parallel code for multi-core architectures. The environment is based on
   the equation-based object-oriented Modelica language and currently uses
   the MetaModelica extended version of Modelica for its model compiler
   implementation. This overview paper gives an up-to-date description of
   the capabilities of the system, short overviews of used open source
   symbolic and numeric algorithms with pointers to published literature,
   tool integration aspects, some lessons learned, and the main vision
   behind its development.},

   industry at present. This paper studies the fusion method of equipment
   information data and geographic information data in the wireless sensor
   network (WSN), and realizes the fusion of WSN sensing data based on the
   proposed development environment. Then, we establish the database model
   and parses the data file. In addition, we realize data visualization in
   web environment based on the Silverlight module. Finally, the visual
   part of the coastal railway monitoring WSN system established in this

   Security},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Software security is an ongoing problem, largely due to a lack of
   security knowledge among software developers from diverse backgrounds.
   To counter this, security experts are attempting to offer a broad range
   of knowledge resources to enlighten developers about increasing
   cybersecurity threats. Unfortunately, the abundance of knowledge
   resources does not seem to have much of an impact on reducing the issue
   of software security. The ineffective teaching and learning approaches
   for software security have created difficulties for developers in
   learning security knowledge. This research employs a four-cycle of
   Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) to integrate necessary
   elements in the development of a context-based learning system for
   security education and learning. The final artifact is an ontology-based
   web application that facilitates a contextualized learning process by
   providing security knowledge through contextual software cases. Through
   evaluation in pedagogical and software development environments, it is
   proven to contribute a viable solution to the problem domain. While
   these results are positive, the innovative context-based artifact
   benefits not only the domain of software engineering but also other
   educational fields, such as information security and computer security.},

Title = {Pattern-based translation of BPMN process models to BPEL web services},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WEB SERVICES RESEARCH},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {42-62},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {The business process modeling notation (BPMN) is a graph-oriented
   language primarily targeted at domain analysts and supported by many
   modeling tools. The business process execution language for Web services
   (BPEL) on the other hand is a mainly block-structured language targeted
   at software developers and supported by several execution platforms.
   Translating BPMN models into BPEL code is a necessary step towards
   standards-based business process development environments. This
   translation is challenging since BPMN and BPEL represent two
   fundamentally different classes of languages. Existing BPMN-to-BPEL
   translations rely on the identification of block-structured patterns in
   BPMN models that are mapped onto structured BPEL constructs. This
   article advances the state of the art in BPMN-to-BPEL translation by
   defining methods for identifying not only perfectly block-structured
   fragments in BPMN models, but quasi-structured fragments that can be
   turned into perfectly structured ones and flow-based acyclic fragments
   that can be mapped onto a combination of structured constructs and
   control links. Beyond its direct relevance in the context of BPMN and
   BPEL, this article addresses issues that arise generally when
   translating between graph-oriented and block-structured flow definition
   languages.},

Pages = {334-356},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The importance of mobile application specific testing techniques and
   methods has been attracting much attention of software engineers over
   the past few years. This is due to the fact that mobile applications are
   different than traditional web and desktop applications, and more and
   more they are moving to being used in critical domains. Mobile
   applications require a different approach to application quality and
   dependability and require an effective testing approach to build high
   quality and more reliable software. We performed a systematic mapping
   study to categorize and to structure the research evidence that has been
   published in the area of mobile application testing techniques and
   challenges that they have reported. Seventy nine (79) empirical studies
   are mapped to a classification schema. Several research gaps are
   identified and specific key testing issues for practitioners are
   identified: there is a need for eliciting testing requirements early
   during development process; the need to conduct research in real-world
   development environments; specific testing techniques targeting
   application life-cycle conformance and mobile services testing; and
   comparative studies for security and usability testing. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Enterprises need to be responsive to meet dynamic businesses and
   requirements. Service-oriented architecture and Web services can improve
   e-Business systems to be integrated and flexible. This paper proposes a
   multi-model driven collaborative development platform for
   service-oriented e-Business systems. The platform provides
   engineers/consultants with three views, i.e., business view, process
   view, and service view to support service-oriented software engineering,
   top-down business design and bottom-up service composite and
   development. The views are kept consistent through model-driven
   translation mechanisms. The platform employs three models, i.e., service
   meta-model, process model and business model to implement the
   translation. On the platform, business and technical
   consultants/engineers can use the views designated for their roles to
   collaborate for a service-oriented e-Business system based at the
   distributed sites of, e.g., IT vendors and their clients. The
   collaboration is featured with visual development and rapid
   demonstration. Comparingly, most of the mainstream development
   environments focus on object-oriented application development other than
   service-oriented business process modeling. The platform has been
   developed and deployed in an innovation centre to be evaluated by
   visiting customers. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Real-time simulator and offline/online closed-loop test bed for power
   system modeling and development},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {122},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The high complexity of modern power systems forces engineers to design,
   implement, and test different equipment, precisely. The real-time
   simulator is one of the best tools for a researcher to test and verify
   complex power systems in the laboratories. Based on this issue, they can
   study power system control methods as well as the effects of various
   models in the partially simulated system. This paper presents a low-cost
   and versatile power system simulator that is applicable for a wide range
   of real-time hardware in the loop (RT-HIL) simulations of power systems.
   To implement the proposed closed-loop simulator, all the essential parts
   of a power plant, including generator, turbine-governor, excitation
   system (automatic voltage regulator (AVR), and power system stabilizer
   (PSS)), grid interconnection and loads are implemented in
   MATLAB/Simulink environment. To achieve fast and reliable measurement
   functions, dedicated programs are developed in the LabVIEW real-time and
   related FPGA programming environments. The data transfer between the
   MATLAB/Simulink model and LABVIEW and its real-time hardware (PXIe-8133)
   is accomplished by building a {*}.dll file as an inbuilt function. A HIL
   simulation of the excitation system is implemented using a real
   excitation cabinet to test system capability and also investigate system
   reaction against disturbances. The performance of the proposed simulator
   is investigated under various scenarios such as excitation voltage
   set-point change, the step response of automatic voltage regulator,
   network three-phase fault, torque step, and step load changes. The close
   correspondence between HIL and MATLAB/Simulink simulations reveals the
   validity of the implemented model for the excitation system as well as
   the effectiveness, flexibility, versatility, applicability, and
   usefulness of the offline/online closed-loop simulator for power system
   modeling and development.},

Abstract = {Purpose Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-National
   Metallurgical Laboratory (CSIR-NML) has launched a number of initiatives
   in different perspectives of e-Government. The ``Mandays-Involvement{''}
   website was implemented by the laboratory in Government-to-Employee
   (G2E) perspective i.e. facilitating its research and development (R\&D)
   manpower by providing data with respect to their own performance
   parameters through a single window. The development and implementation
   of the website had two major objectives : (1) to provide a system to the
   researchers for tracking and improving their own performance with
   respect to mandays and external cash flow generation and (2) to equip
   the management with a tool to enhance the organizational performance and
   enable optimum employee utilization. Design/methodology/approach
   Software Development Life Cycle approach was followed for the web-based
   system development and iterative model was used. Open source web
   development tools i.e. Php, My-Sql and CSS were used for the system
   development. Findings The new system helped in detailed profiling of
   current and future assignment of the researchers so as to have a check
   over preference-based allocation of work and providing equal
   opportunities of work to all. Research limitations/implications The
   percentage average mandays utilization was stabilized after the
   implementation of the website. The percentage under and over engagements
   of researchers in R\&D projects was controlled and reduced. Practical
   implications The system outputs are utilized for R\&D Team formation,
   Project approvals and Annual Performance Evaluations. Originality/value
   This new information system acts as a decision support system that helps
   the management to align its organizational policies toward the Future

   Sequential 3-Part Use Case Study of Diverse Post-Secondary Students},

Abstract = {Web-based virtual reality (VR) development tools are in ubiquitous use
   by software developers, and now, university (undergraduate) students, to
   move beyond using, to creating new and energizing VR content. Web-based
   VR (WebVR), among other libraries and frameworks, have risen as a
   low-cost platform for users to create rich and intuitive VR content and
   applications. However, the success of WebVR as an instructional tool
   relies on post-secondary students technological acceptance (TA), the
   intersectionality of a user's perceived utility (PU) and perceived ease
   of use (PEOU, or convenience) with said technological tool. Yet, there
   is a dearth of exploratory studies of students' experiences with the
   AR/VR development technologies to infer their TA. To ascertain the
   viability of WebVR tools for software engineering undergraduates in the
   classroom, this paper presents a 3-case contextual investigation of 38
   undergraduate students tasked with creating VR content. In each use
   case, students were provided increasing freedom in their VR content
   development parameters. Results indicated that students demonstrated
   elements of technological acceptance in their selection of webVR and
   other platforms, and not only successfully creating rich and robust VR
   content (PU), but also executing these projects in a short period
   (PEOU). Other positive externalities observed were students exhibitions
   of soft skills (e.g. creativity, critical thinking) and different modes
   of demonstrating coding knowledge, which suggest further study.

Title = {Design of Tennis Mobile Teaching Assistant System Based on Ordinary
   Differential Equations},
Journal = {APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND NONLINEAR SCIENCES},

Month = {2022 JUL 15},
Abstract = {Tennis is a sport, which is mainly composed of many parts, such as
   mobile devices, software and hardware. With the rapid development of
   today's time, people's living standards are getting higher and higher,
   the traditional teaching mode can no longer meet the user's needs well,
   so teachers need to help students improve their overall quality with the
   help of more advanced modern online teaching methods, therefore, the
   design of a practical and flexible mobile assistance system is necessary
   for universities nowadays. This paper mainly introduces the tennis
   auxiliary system based on ordinary differential equations, which is
   based on the database, and it has the functions of data collection,
   processing and display. This software is designed and implemented by
   using javaSwing technology and solidworks development tools. After that,
   SSH framework is used to create the application and backend management
   interface for later maintenance and update, so that the management can
   understand the students' situation at any time and make corresponding
   decision analysis to better serve the users and improve the quality and
   level of tennis teaching.},

Title = {Universal point cloud viewer based on Unreal video game Engine},
Journal = {DISEGNARECON},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {30},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Point clouds are an essential tool for documenting archaeological and
   architectural heritage, since they are the initial product that can be
   obtained from a laser scanner or photogrammetry survey. Despite being a
   very basic and discretized source of information containing only
   coloured points, they can be used as a first approach to the surveyed
   model through a virtual visualization or interactive tour.
   The management and visualization of point clouds is not an easy task,
   since it involves the representation of millions of points and
   installing specific viewers is mandatory. These special viewers are
   developed by each laser scanner manufacturer to visualize its own point
   cloud file format. Handling with them can result unfriendly and
   non-intuitive for a non-specialized public. Therefore, the main
   objective of this work is to develop a working methodology based on
   Unreal Engine, a video game development environment, to create
   self-executing visualization modules that can be shared with any user.
   These modules will allow simple and fluid navigation of point clouds
   without the need of installing any additional software or having
   specific knowledge.
   These self-executing modules will allow any kind of viewer, specialised
   or not, to visualize the point cloud in a first-person way or from a
   bird's eye view. The exposed methodology has been tested using a survey
   of the Oliva Castle in Valencia (Spain), which is classified as a
   cultural interest asset. In order to illustrate the results of this
   research, some images of the visualization environment will be shown and
   the download link of the display module corresponding to the Oliva
   Castle will be provided.},

Abstract = {The traditional databases are not capable of handling unstructured data
   and high volumes of real-time datasets. Diverse datasets are
   unstructured lead to big data, and it is laborious to store, manage,
   process, analyze, visualize, and extract the useful insights from these
   datasets using traditional database approaches. However, many technical
   aspects exist in refining large heterogeneous datasets in the trend of
   big data. This paper aims to present a generalized view of complete big
   data system which includes several stages and key components of each
   stage in processing the big data. In particular, we compare and contrast
   various distributed file systems and MapReduce-supported NoSQL databases
   concerning certain parameters in data management process. Further, we
   present distinct distributed/cloud-based machine learning (ML) tools
   that play a key role to design, develop and deploy data models. The
   paper investigates case studies on distributed ML tools such as Mahout,
   Spark MLlib, and FlinkML. Further, we classify analytics based on the
   type of data, domain, and application. We distinguish various
   visualization tools pertaining three parameters: functionality, analysis
   capabilities, and supported development environment. Furthermore, we
   systematically investigate big data tools and technologies (Hadoop 3.0,
   Spark 2.3) including distributed/cloud-based stream processing tools in
   a comparative approach. Moreover, we discuss functionalities of several
   SQL Query tools on Hadoop based on 10 parameters. Finally, We present
   some critical points relevant to research directions and opportunities
   according to the current trend of big data. Investigating infrastructure
   tools for big data with recent developments provides a better
   understanding that how different tools and technologies apply to solve
   real-life applications.},

Title = {Active Distance Learning of Embedded Systems},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {41104-41122},
Abstract = {The move from face-to-face to distance learning poses a challenge for
   courses that rely on hands-on experience such as embedded systems. In
   this course, students need to work with hardware and software to achieve
   various learning objectives. For full advantage, the hands-on experience
   should be aligned with the acquisition of related concepts and
   procedural knowledge. The alignment of conceptual learning with hands-on
   experience is a big challenge, in general, and for distance learning, in
   particular. This article describes how different learning technologies
   can be integrated to achieve such alignment for embedded systems in a
   distance learning mode. A framework for active, lecture-free learning
   was established using a learning management system, YouTube, various web
   resources, a hardware kit, and a software development environment. The
   learning activities were implemented as ungraded quizzes on Moodle with
   different types of questions. These include review questions, conceptual
   questions, procedural questions, brainstorming questions, code analysis
   questions, and code creation questions. Our students used the provided
   hardware kit and the software development environment to complete the
   learning activities throughout the semester without listening to any
   live or recorded lecture from our end. This instructional design was
   evaluated by analyzing learning data generated by Moodle as well as
   self-report data. The results show high student engagement and positive
   perceptions of the course content and the learning method. We believe
   that the proposed pedagogical framework of this design is of general
   value and can be adopted in other engineering courses with similar
   requirements of hands-on experience in distance learning.},

Pages = {405-418},
Abstract = {A smart home module program is designed based on Linux, in the ARM11
   embedded development environment, and by using the UP-Magic 6410
   development board. A touch-screen graphical interface for human-computer
   interaction is designed using QT. The sensor module is integrated into
   the underlying QT program, and the actuator module program performs
   external calls via QT, thus a complete set of smart home terminal is
   constituted. The function of remote video monitoring and the function of
   displaying module statuses on webpage are realized through connecting
   video cameras to the development board as well as constructing GoAhead
   web server and Spcaserv video server. A face recognition program is
   designed using MATLAB, a database for storing the face information for
   different users is designed, and they are connected to the smart home
   terminal. Based on face recognition, the identity information for the
   current user and the desired temperature are displayed, and the speed of
   the DC motor is changed. This system can also realize sound and light
   alarm. Alarm for harmful gas can be raised under the help of smoke
   sensor. The photosensitive sound switch module is used for simulating
   the voice control device so as to facilitate the user's control of the
   DC motor switch. Infrared irradiation sensor is used for simulating the
   identity-card identification equipment, so as to limit the system users.
   Through the coordination of the above parts, a complete smart home
   system which is composed of a computer, embedded development
   environment, sensors, actuators and ancillary devices is finally
   established.},

   Planning by Third-Party Logistics (3PL)},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Currently, there is still a strong trend in research and in the market
   connected with the role of 3PL (third-party logistics) companies and the
   trend of developing and creating coordination in logistics networks. The
   most important issue for the following paper is the examination of the
   3PL enterprise, which is able to create the demand forecasts to gain the
   functions of logistics coordination in the fields of inventory
   management and transportation planning. This research paper focuses on
   showing the demand forecasting tool results for 29 chosen distribution
   networks (in this paper, the traditional forecasting methods were used
   based on time series exponential smoothing, ARIMA, machine learning and
   neural-network-based methods, created in the R programming environment).
   In the next steps, the forecasting results were compared in the
   conditions of transportation planning and inventory management (in the
   conditions of ``future{''} dynamic ABC analysis). The forecasting
   function supports the inventory management and transportation planning
   activity of 3PL as a key element of logistics coordination in
   distribution networks. The proper way to transfer the results of
   forecasting to an ABC analysis and transportation planning concept is to
   create a cloud-based system supported by data from the WMS (warehouse
   management system), while providing the possibility of results
   visualization by using some BI (business intelligence) solutions or
   different tools to create managerial information dashboards. Currently,
   one of the most efficient models connected with logistics coordination
   is the centralized network with 3PL responsible for planning and
   executing logistics processes with the creation of additional value. As
   such, 3PL is able to create a similar forecast for different types of DN
   and with different aggregations (per SKU or per recipient). It could
   support coordination in DN from the point of view of inventory
   management and transportation planning.},

Abstract = {Web-surveys are one of the most popular forms of primary data collection
   used for various researches. However, mass surveys involve some
   challenges. It is required to consider different platforms and browsers,
   as well as different data transfer rates using connections in different
   regions of the country. Ensuring guaranteed data delivery in these
   conditions should determine the right choice of technologies for
   implementing web-surveys. The paper describes the solution to transfer a
   questionnaire to the client side in the form of an archive. This
   technological solution ensures independence from the data transfer rate
   and the stability of the communication connection with significant
   survey filling time. The conducted survey benefited the service of
   education psychologists under the federal Ministry of Education. School
   psychologists consciously took part in the survey, realizing the
   importance of their opinion for organizing and improving their
   professional activities. The desire to answer open-ended questions in
   detail created a part of the answers in the dataset, where there were
   several sentences about different aspects of professional activity. An
   important challenge of the problem is the Russian language, for which
   there are not as many tools as for the languages more widespread in the
   world. The survey involved 20,443 school psychologists from all regions
   of the Russian Federation, both from urban and rural areas. The answers
   did not contain spam, runaround answers, and so on as evidenced by the
   average response time. For the surveys, an authoring development tool
   DigitalPsyTools.ru was used.

   strength of evidence supporting psoriasis treatment with pioglitazone,
   we conducted a meta-analysis of existing published studies. Methods:
   PubMed, Ovid, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and Web of Science
   databases were systematically searched before February 2019. Randomized
   controlled trials (RCTs) of pioglitazone administration compared with
   placebo, administered to patients with psoriasis for at least 10 weeks,
   and published in English were included. Quality of the included RCTs was
   identified by the modified Jadad scale. The quality of evidence for each
   outcome was evaluated using the GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool
   online software. Primary outcomes were proportion of patients showing
   psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score improvement (>75\%) and
   the mean percent change in PASI score from baseline to the end of
   treatment. Dichotomous data were analyzed using odds ratios (ORs)
   corresponding to the 95\% confidence interval (CI), whereas continuous
   variables, expressed as mean and standard deviation, were analyzed using
   the mean differences (MD) with the 95\% CI. Results: Six RCTs were
   analyzed. Meta-analysis showed that pioglitazone reduced the PASI scores
   in patients with psoriasis compared with the control group when
   administered at 30 mg per day (P < 0.001, MD = -3.82, 95\% CI = -5.70,
   -1.93) and at 15 mg per day (P = 0.04, MD = -3.53, 95\% CI = -6.86,
   -0.20). The PASI-75 of the pioglitazone group was significantly higher
   than that of the control group at 30 mg per day (P < 0.001, OR = 8.30,
   95\% CI = 3.99, 17.27) and at 15 mg per day (P = 0.03, OR = 2.96, 95\%
   CI = 1.08, 8.06). No statistically significant differences in total
   adverse events were observed between the groups. There were no
   significant differences in common adverse reactions such as weight gain
   and elevated liver enzymes between the two pioglitazone groups.
   Conclusions: Use of pioglitazone in the current treatment of psoriasis
   is beneficial. The therapeutic effect of the daily 30 mg dose may be
   greater than that of the 15 mg dose per day with no significant change
   in the frequency of adverse reactions.},

Abstract = {In green buildings design and construction, evaluating the sustainable
   effects of site location and transportation to the ecosystem and human
   life is a critical and difficult task. Works regarding these matters
   require experience, time, labor, and manual calculations. In recent
   years, many studies have been conducted to enhance the application of
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) in green building certifications.
   However, the application of BIM to site location and transportation
   analysis is usually considered impractical due to the lack of a powerful
   map application in present BIM products. The aim of this research is to
   develop a framework for the integration of BIM and Web Map Service (WMS)
   technologies for location and transportation analysis in green building
   certifications. Using Autodesk Revit API and Google Maps API as the
   development tools, this research converts the integration model into the
   BIM-integrated plugin in Autodesk Revit. The plugin is used to
   streamline the certification process of site location and transportation
   analysis in LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), one of
   the most popular and globally recognized green building standards. (C)

Abstract = {In this study, we proposed Smart Open Data as a Service (SODAS) as a new
   open data platform based on the international standards Data Catalog
   Vocabulary (DCAT) and Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network (CKAN) to
   facilitate the release and sharing of data. We first analyze the five
   problems in the legacy CKAN and then draw up corresponding solutions
   through three core strategies: CKAN expansion, DCATv2 support, and
   extendable DataMap. We then define four components and nine function
   blocks of SODAS for each core strategy. As a result, SODAS drives Open
   Data Portal, Open Data Reference Model, DataMap Publisher, and Analytics
   and Development Environment (ADE) Provisioning for connecting the
   defined function blocks. We confirm that each function works correctly
   through the SODAS Web portal, and then we apply SODAS to actual data
   distribution sites to prove its efficiency and practical use. SODAS is
   the first open data platform that provides secure interoperability
   between heterogeneous platforms based on international standards, and it
   enables domain-free data management with flexible metadata.},

Journal = {DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {While small-scale search engines in specific domains and languages are
   increasingly used by Web users, most existing search engine development
   tools do not support the development of search engines in languages
   other than English, cannot be integrated with other applications, or
   rely on proprietary software. A tool that supports search engine
   creation in multiple languages is thus highly desired. To study the
   research issues involved, we review related literature and suggest the
   criteria for an ideal search tool. We present the design of a toolkit,
   called SpidersRUs, developed for multilingual search engine creation.
   The design and implementation of the tool, consisting of a Spider
   module, an Indexer module, an Index Structure, a Search module, and a
   Graphical User Interface module, are discussed in detail. A sample user
   session and a case study on using the tool to develop a medical search
   engine in Chinese are also presented. The technical issues involved and
   the lessons learned in the project are then discussed. This study
   demonstrates that the proposed architecture is feasible in developing
   search engines easily in different languages such as Chinese, Spanish,

Abstract = {Thanks to the development of information technologies and computing
   resources, it became possible to obtain and process big data, including
   geospatial data. Most research in the field of precision farming is
   interdisciplinary in nature, with experimental field data used by
   disparate scientific groups. In this connection, it became necessary to
   develop a unified web-based system for storing, organizing, and
   exchanging experimental information between researchers. The first step
   in achieving this goal was to create a geospatial database. Since the
   system being developed in the future may require extensions,
   modifications, adjustments, integration into other projects, it seems
   appropriate to use the ontology to form the database structure. The most
   popular tools were used as the main tools: the ontology language OWL
   (Ontology Web Language), the Protege 5.5 development environment. The
   main initial information obtained in the course of experimental studies
   carried out at the biopolygon: weather data, agrochemical indicators
   (sampling of soil and plants with georeferencing), agrophysical
   parameters (humidity, electrical conductivity), remote sensing data.
   Based on the results of the analysis of the current state of research in
   the field of storage and systematization of experimental information in
   crop production, as well as a survey of ARI employees, a prototype of
   the database structure was formed based on the ontological approach.
   Nine parent classes were defined as the foundation: Field, Crop rotation
   - experience, Agrotechnology, Yield, Meteo, Ground samples, Orthophoto,
   Calendar, and Dictionary - units of measurement.},

Title = {Consolidating metabolite identifiers to enable contextual and
   multi-platform metabolomics data analysis},
Journal = {BMC BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {11},
Month = {APR 29},
Abstract = {Background: Analysis of data from high-throughput experiments depends on
   the availability of well-structured data that describe the assayed
   biomolecules. Procedures for obtaining and organizing such meta-data on
   genes, transcripts and proteins have been streamlined in many data
   analysis packages, but are still lacking for metabolites. Chemical
   identifiers are notoriously incoherent, encompassing a wide range of
   different referencing schemes with varying scope and coverage. Online
   chemical databases use multiple types of identifiers in parallel but
   lack a common primary key for reliable database consolidation.
   Connecting identifiers of analytes found in experimental data with the
   identifiers of their parent metabolites in public databases can
   therefore be very laborious.
   Results: Here we present a strategy and a software tool for integrating
   metabolite identifiers from local reference libraries and public
   databases that do not depend on a single common primary identifier. The
   program constructs groups of interconnected identifiers of analytes and
   metabolites to obtain a local metabolite-centric SQLite database. The
   created database can be used to map in-house identifiers and synonyms to
   external resources such as the KEGG database. New identifiers can be
   imported and directly integrated with existing data. Queries can be
   performed in a flexible way, both from the command line and from the
   statistical programming environment R, to obtain data set tailored
   identifier mappings.
   Conclusions: Efficient cross-referencing of metabolite identifiers is a
   key technology for metabolomics data analysis. We provide a practical
   and flexible solution to this task and an open-source program, the
   metabolite masking tool (MetMask), available at
   http://metmask.sourceforge.net, that implements our ideas.},

Abstract = {Developing an algorithm for a visualization prototype often involves the
   direct comparison of different development stages and design decisions,
   and even minor modifications may dramatically affect the results. While
   existing development tools provide visualizations for gaining general
   insight into performance and structural aspects of the source code, they
   neglect the central importance of result images unique to graphical

   corresponding visual outcomes by providing an automatically updating
   meta visualization. Our interactive system allows for the direct
   comparison of all development states on both the visual and the source

   The on-the-fly construction of difference images, source code
   differences, and a visual representation of the source code structure
   further enhance the user's insight into the states' interconnected
   changes over time. Our solution is accessible via a web-based interface

Abstract = {In recent years, a paradigm shift is underway as robots leave their
   typical application field and move into domains that have been untouched
   by robotic automation. These new kinds of automation systems allow more
   product variations, smaller life cycles, smaller batch sizes and pave
   the way from mass production to mass customization. This is due to
   completely new breed of safe robot technology but also novel ways of
   setting up new applications like e.g. kinesthetic programming. However,
   the topic of reducing the programming effort for complex tasks using
   natural modes of communication is still open. This paper addresses the
   key developments in this field, shows different ways of programming, and
   gives relevant use cases in industrial assembly. The technology coverage
   starts with an online workflow editor called XROB that allows
   easy-to-use setup of process workflows and related skill parameters.
   However, in order to reduce the programming effort, a novel way to
   demonstrate process trajectories by using instrumented hand guided
   process tools is presented. Finally, the paper gives an overview of a
   promising approach that allows programming without touching the robot
   just by demonstrating the process by an expert. The semantic relations
   between activities executed by the human and robot skills are captured
   to learn the task sequence of the assembly process. The acquired process
   knowledge is refined to execute robotic tasks with the help of an
   interactive graphical user interface (GUI). The system queries the user
   for feedback, asking for specific information to help the robot complete
   the task at hand. The given examples show the usability of flexible
   programming tools in the automation chain and the presented results
   provide strong evidence of the technological potential in the field.},

Abstract = {The area of tool support for software inspection has been under active
   research since the early 1990's. Although numerous implementations exist
   and development is still taking place, no tool has achieved a
   breakthrough. The main reason is that one tool usually demonstrates only
   one new idea, neglecting other features. A different approach must be
   taken, and software inspection tools should be seen as integral parts of
   the development environment. This paper categorises the existing tools
   into four generations based on the transition from traditional meeting
   support to asynchronous distributed inspections implemented with web
   technologies. Based on the analysis of 16 tools and our experiences, we
   summarize the most important features and add two new aspects to be
   notified when implementing the next generation of inspection tools for
   use in modem software development, flexibility and integration. The
   major focus is on comprehension, and we have taken the first steps at
   achieving this.},

Abstract = {RadNotes is a novel software development tool that enables physicians to
   develop teaching materials incorporating text and images in an
   intelligent, highly usable format, Projects undertaken in the RadNotes
   environment require neither programming expertise nor the assistance of
   a software engineer, The first of these projects, Thoracic Imaging,
   integrates image teaching files, concise disease and topic summaries,
   references, and flash card quizzes into a single program designed to
   provide an overview of chest radiology. RadNotes is intended to support
   the academic goals of teaching radiologists by enabling authors to
   create, edit, and electronically distribute image-oriented
   presentations, RadNotes also supports the educational goals of
   physicians who wish to quickly review selected imaging topics, as well
   as to develop a visual vocabulary of corresponding radiologic anatomy
   and pathologic conditions, Although Thoracic Imaging was developed with
   the aim of introducing chest radiology to residents, RadNotes can be
   used to develop tutorials and image-based tests for all levels; create
   corresponding World Wide Web sites; and organize notes, images, and
   references for individual use.},

Title = {Useware engineering: a methodology for the development of user-friendly
   interfaces},
Journal = {LIBRARY HI TECH},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {126-140},
Abstract = {Purpose - The development time for user interfaces is drastically
   reduced by today's shorter product life cycles. Generally, at the end of
   the development phase there is not enough time or money left to enhance
   the usability of software. After the user interface has been developed,
   the users are left alone to handle any problems with the interface.
   Systematic development using engineering processes can help to overcome
   these usability problems. Engineering processes identify and consider
   clearly defined requirements during the development phase. This results
   in more usable products and a growing recognition of the importance of
   engineering processes. This article aims to introduce a structured
   Useware engineering process that increases the effectiveness and
   efficiency of user interface development.
   Design/methodology/approach - This article introduces a structured
   Useware engineering process, the application of which enhances user
   orientation which leads to higher acceptance and more practical user
   interfaces.
   Findings - The article finds that the current process is supported by
   various expert development tools for the production of user interfaces;
   these tools ensure a systematic and continuous data transferability from
   one phase to the next. The process has already provided remarkable
   results in the area of task orientation and usability within several
   different industrial sectors, e.g. medicine, manufacturing industry and
   process engineering. Further possibilities to apply this process are
   software for online catolog planning or lending and return machines.
   Originality/value - This article introduces a structured engineering
   process that increases the effectiveness and efficiency of user
   interface development which has the possibility of use in online catolog
   planning or lending and return machines.},

   via a web survey. In the survey, a technology acceptance model (TAM) was
   used as the basis for constructing the measurement items in order to
   answer the following questions: (1) which tool type is preferred and
   perceived as better, and (2) which variables influence the user's
   perceptions and decisions. In this study, we searched for an optimal way

Abstract = {Objective: To assess the impact of the distance education course
   ``Sickle Cell Disease: Primary Health Care Line{''} on knowledge
   acquisition of professional healthcare providers.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with a quantitative
   approach at the Educational and Support Center for Hemoglobinopathies
   (Cehmob-MG), state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, in 2016. One hundred and
   fifty-three out of 300 professional healthcare providers were invited to
   participate in the proposed distance course. Of the participating
   professional healthcare providers, 72 (47\%) successfully concluded the
   course (Group A), whereas 81 (53\%) did not complete their course
   assignments and did not meet the minimum requirements for regular
   attendance (Group B). Knowledge acquisition was assessed with the
   Knowledge of Sickle Cell Disease Instrument, DFConhecimento, applied
   using the web tool eSurv. Univariate analysis by Poisson regression was
   employed to assess the influence of sociodemographic variables on the
   DFConhecimento score and to select variables to compose the initial
   multivariate regression model (p-value < 0.20). The analysis was
   performed in the statistical programming environment R.
   Results: The average score was 9.76 for Group A and 6.54 for Group B.
   The two groups were considered statistically different (p-value <0.05)
   for all items with the proportion of correct items being greater in
   Group A. Professional healthcare providers who concluded the course had
   a significantly higher DFConhecimento score (45\%) when compared to
   those who did not successfully conclude the course.
   Conclusion: Participation in a distance education course on sickle cell
   disease had a positive impact on the acquisition of knowledge about the
   disease by professional healthcare providers. (C) 2018 Associacao

Abstract = {As Information and Communication Technology (ICT) literacy education has
   recently shifted to fostering computing thinking ability as well as ICT
   use, many countries are conducting research on national curriculum and
   evaluation. In this study, we measured Korean students' ICT literacy
   levels by using the national measurement tool that assesses abilities of
   the IT (Information Technology) area and the CT (Computational Thinking)
   area. A research team revised an existing ICT literacy assessment tool
   for the IT test and developed a new CT test environment in which
   students could perform actual coding through a web-based programming
   tool such as Scratch. Additionally, after assessing ICT literacy levels,
   differences in ICT literacy levels by gender and grade were analyzed to
   provide evidence for national education policies. Approximately 23,000
   elementary and middle school students participated in the 2018 national
   assessment of ICT literacy, accounting for 1\% of the national
   population of students. The findings demonstrated that female students
   had higher literacy levels in most sub-factors of IT and CT areas.
   Additionally, in the areas of strengths and weaknesses, the ratio of
   below-basic achievement among male students was at least two times
   greater than that of female students. Nonetheless, male students scored
   higher on CT automation, a coding item that involved problem solving
   using Scratch. Looking at the difference according to grade level, the
   level improved as the school year increased in elementary school, but
   there was no difference in middle school. When analyzing the detailed
   elements of middle school students, the automation factor of seventh
   grade students was found to be higher than eighth and ninth grade
   students. Based on these results, this study discussed some implications
   for ICT and computing education in elementary and middle schools.},

Abstract = {Sinter ore quality directly affects the stability of blast furnace
   production. In terms of both physical and chemical properties, the main
   indicators of sinter quality are the TFe content, alkalinity, and drum
   index. By analyzing the massive historical data on the sinter production
   of a steel company, this study proposes a sinter quality prediction
   system based on Granger causality analysis and a stacking integration
   algorithm. First, based on real historical data of sintering production
   in steel enterprises (including coal gas pressure, ignition temperature,
   combustion air pressure, etc.), data preprocessing of raw data was
   carried out using a combination of feature engineering and the sintering
   process. Second, Pearson correlation analysis, Spearman correlation
   analysis, and Granger causality analysis were used to screen out the
   characteristic parameters with a strong influence on the target variable
   of sinter quality (drum Index, TFe, alkalinity). Third, a prediction
   model for sinter quality parameters was developed using a stacking
   integration algorithm pair for training. Finally, a program development
   tool was used to realize the establishment and online operation of a
   sinter ore quality prediction system. The test results showed that the
   predicted goodness of fit of the model for the TFe content, alkalinity
   (R), and drum index were 0.942, 0.958, and 0.987, respectively, and the
   model calculation time met the actual production requirements. By
   establishing a suitable model and running the program online, the
   real-time prediction of the main indicators of sinter quality was
   realized to guide production promptly.},

   these abilities of agents, the structure of the system is more suitable
   to handle dynamic events. The proposed dynamic scheduling system is
   tested on several test problems the literature and the results are quite
   satisfactory because it generates effective schedules for both dynamic

   are expensive. In this paper, an e-learning framework for the Kotlin
   programming language is presented, supporting automatic grading of given
   assessments. This framework is aimed at students who already have basic
   knowledge of Java (or similar) programming languages, and want to switch
   to mobile development. The solution focuses on the development of an
   interactive course in Kotlin. Furthermore, to compare our solution with
   commercially available ones, we point out the disadvantages of currently

Title = {Potential antiviral activities of chrysin against hepatitis B virus},
Journal = {GUT PATHOGENS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 9},
Abstract = {Background Interferon and nucleos(t)ide analogues are current
   therapeutic treatments for chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection
   with the limitations of a functional cure. Chrysin (5,
   7-dihydroxyflavone) is a natural flavonoid, known for its antiviral and
   hepatoprotective activities. However, its anti-HBV activity is
   unexplored.Methods In the present study, the anti-hepatitis B activity
   of chrysin was investigated using the in vitro experimental cell culture
   model, HepG2 cells. In silico studies were performed where chrysin and
   lamivudine (used here as a positive control) were docked with high
   mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1). For the in vitro studies, wild
   type HBV genome construct (pHBV 1.3X) was transiently transfected in
   HepG2. In culture supernatant samples, HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and
   Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) were measured by enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Secreted HBV DNA and intracellular
   covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) were measured by SYBR green
   real-time PCR. The 3D crystal structure of HMGB1 (1AAB) protein was
   developed and docked with the chrysin and lamivudine. In silico
   drug-likeness, Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and
   Toxicity (ADMET) properties of finest ligands were performed by using
   SwissADME and admetSAR web servers.Results Data showed that chrysin
   significantly decreases HBeAg, HBsAg secretion, supernatant HBV DNA and
   cccDNA, in a dose dependent manner. The docking studies demonstrated
   HMGB1 as an important target for chrysin as compared to lamivudine.
   Chrysin revealed high binding affinity and formed a firm kissing complex
   with HMGB1 ( increment delta G = - 5.7 kcal/mol), as compared to
   lamivudine ( increment delta G = - 4.3 kcal/mol), which might be
   responsible for its antiviral activity.Conclusions The outcome of our
   study establishes chrysin as a new antiviral against HBV infection.
   However, using chrysin to treat chronic HBV disease needs further
   endorsement and optimization by in vivo studies in animal models.},

Title = {The effectiveness of TDF versus ETV on incidence of HCC in CHB patients:
   a meta analysis},
Journal = {BMC CANCER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {MAY 29},
Abstract = {BackgroundIt has been proved that nucleos(t) ide analogues (NAs) therapy
   could improve underlying liver disease and reduce the incidence of
   hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However,
   the difference of effectiveness in reducing HCC occurrence between
   tenofovir (TDF) and enticavir (ETV), two first-line NAs drugs, is still
   little known. This meta analysis aims to assess the efficacy in reducing
   incidence of HCC comparing tenofovir monotherapy with entecavir
   monotherapy among chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients by analyzing their
   long-term clinical outcomes.MethodsDatabases including PubMed, Embase,
   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial, and ISI Web of Science
   were fully investigated according to the Preferred Reporting Items for
   Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. For the
   included articles, two of the authors independently extracted and
   confirmed relevant data. Review Manager software (RevMan 5.3) was using
   for meta analysis.ResultsSeven articles with 3698 patients were finally
   included in this research, 1574 in tenofovir group and 2124 in entecavir
   group. For meta analysis, the incidence of HCC was significantly lower
   among the tenofovir group than entecavir group {[}rate ratio (95\% CI)
   of 0.66 (0.49, 0.89), P=0.008], while there was no statistical
   significance in incidence of death or transplantation {[}rate ratio
   (95\% CI) of 0.78 (0.55, 1.13), P=0.19], encephalopathy {[}risk ratio
   (95\% CI) of 0.72 (0.45, 1.13), P=0.15] or variceal bleeding {[}risk
   ratio (95\% CI) of 0.71 (0.34, 1.50), P=0.37] between the two
   groups.ConclusionThere is a better effect of tenofovir in reducing HCC
   incidence than entecavir, which indicates tenofovir should be used more
   widely while treating chronic hepatitis B patients. However before
   applying, randomized controlled trial and large prospective cohort study
   should be performed in the future.},

Title = {A Combination of Native LC-MS Approaches for the Comprehensive
   Characterization of the Antibody-Drug Conjugate Trastuzumab Deruxtecan},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BIOSCIENCE-LANDMARK},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 31},
Abstract = {Background: Native mass spectrometry (nMS) approaches appear attractive
   to complement bottom-up strategies traditionally used in
   biopharmaceutical industries thanks to their quite straightforward and
   rapid workflows, especially through online hyphenation of nondenaturing
   liquid chromatography (LC) to nMS. The present work provides an overview
   of the state-of-the-art chromatographic tools available for the detailed
   characterization of monoclonal antibody (mAb) formats, exemplified on
   the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd).
   Methods: T-DXd was first characterized by conventional reversed phase LC
   (rpLC) and peptide mapping. Couplings of size exclusion chromatography
   (SEC), cation exchange chromatography (CEX), and hydrophobic interaction
   chromatography (HIC) to nMS were used to gain further insights into
   size, hydrophobic, and charge variants of T-DXd and its parental mAb
   trastuzumab, at intact and middle-up levels. Results: SEC-nMS first
   offered a direct snapshot of the homogeneous conjugation of T-DXd, with
   an average drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 8 in agreement with a
   conjugation on cysteines after reduction of all interchain disulfide
   bonds. Moreover, SEC-nMS afforded precise identification and
   quantification of aggregates and fragments. Middle-up level experiments
   performed after IdeS digestion confirmed that drug conjugation occurs in
   the Fab region of the mAb, as seen with rpLC. HIC separated two DAR8
   species that could not be differentiated by nMS. Although middle-up
   HIC-nMS proved to be more informative for oxidized forms, the
   identification of minor variants was still difficult because of poor MS
   signal quality, showing how the coupling of HIC to nMS remains
   challenging. Lastly, middle-up CEX-nMS provided accurate determination
   and localization of post-translational modifications, with several
   acidic/basic variants within Fab and Fc regions of T-DXd that were also
   identified by peptide mapping. Conclusions: This study illustrates the
   strengths and drawbacks of each LC-nMS coupling. By combining SEC-,
   HIC-, and CEX-nMS, we were able to achieve a comprehensive
   characterization of T-DXd without extensive sample preparation prior to
   MS analysis.},

Abstract = {The robotic arm is an automatic control device that imitates the
   function of a human arm and accurately recognizes specific points in the
   three-dimensional space according to received instructions. This article
   aims to study the wireless control system of six-degree-of-freedom
   manipulator under the Internet of Things. In this paper, the Arduino
   material platform is used as the main controller, combined with Arduino
   IDE to complete the six-degree-of-freedom manipulator and main load
   control program, and use APPinventor to develop Android applications,
   and realize the wireless control of the manipulator through Bluetooth
   mode. In addition, the robot arm Jacobi control algorithm is used to
   describe the differential mapping relationship between the robot arm
   motion and the camera image space, and the image is updated online
   through the calculation method to improve the accuracy of the robot arm
   light control server. Mark the control of each joint, and then collect
   these control signals and the position information of the six joints. In
   order to ensure the richness of the entry signs and the safety of the
   equipment, the control signal given here is a random signal, and the
   output signal is six connected position signals.A total of 400 input and
   output sample sets were used. The first 200 units were used for training
   and the last 200 were used for testing. The experimental results in this
   paper show that the performance of the six-degree-of-freedom manipulator
   based on the Internet of Things is 25\% higher than that of the
   traditional machine, and the stability of the wireless control system is
   also improved by 18\% compared with before.},

Title = {The Impact of Nucleos(t)ide Analogs Off-Therapy Among Chronic Hepatitis
   B Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Background and Aim: Although most chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients
   achieve effective virological suppression after receiving long-term
   nucleos(t)ide analogs (Nucs) therapy, the safety of off-therapy is
   controversial under the monitor.
   Methods: We identified studies through searching PubMed, Embase,
   Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from January 1990 to February 2021.
   The eligible studies compare the long outcomes between discontinued and
   continued Nucs treatments groups among CHB patients. This study was
   conducted to investigate long-term outcomes, including biochemical,
   serological, and virological outcomes, as well as hepatocellular
   carcinoma (HCC) development rate between discontinued and maintained
   Nucs therapy groups among CHB patients.
   Results: Five eligible studies covering 1,425 patients were selected for
   meta-analysis. Our result exhibits that patients with Nucs off-treatment
   have a higher risk of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) flares-up than
   those who continued Nucs therapy under the monitor (OR = 9.39, 95\%CI =
   3.87-22.78). Nucs off-therapy patients have a higher virological bound
   incidence (OR = 617.96, 95\%CI = 112.48-3,395.14) and a higher HBV DNA
   level (OR = 9.39, 95\%CI = 3.87-22.78) than those who continued Nucs
   therapy. There was no statistically significant difference in the risk
   of hyperbilirubinaemia, hepatic decompensation, and HCC development
   between both two groups. Patients in Nucs off-therapy group demonstrate
   a higher HBsAg loss rate than those in the continued group (OR = 7.10,
   95\%CI = 6.68-13.69).
   Conclusions: Nucs off-therapy patients may exhibit a higher chance of
   achieving HBsAg loss than those who continue Nucs therapy. It requires
   close monitoring after Nucs off-therapy and timely restarting of Nucs
   therapy when ALT concentrations increase.},

Title = {Accuracy evaluation of dental CBCT and scanned model registration method
   based on pulp horn mapping surface: an in vitro proof-of-concept},
Journal = {BMC ORAL HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 22},
Abstract = {Background and aim 3D fusion model of cone-beam computed tomography
   (CBCT) and oral scanned data can be used for the accurate design of root
   canal access and guide plates in root canal therapy (RCT). However, the
   pose accuracy of the dental pulp and crown in data registration has not
   been investigated, which affects the precise implementation of clinical
   planning goals. We aimed to establish a novel registration method based
   on pulp horn mapping surface (PHMSR), to evaluate the accuracy of PHMSR
   versus traditional methods for crown-pulp registration of CBCT and oral
   scan data. Materials and methods This vitro study collected 8 groups of
   oral scanned and CBCT data in which the left mandibular teeth were not
   missing, No. 35 and No. 36 teeth were selected as the target teeth. The
   CBCT and scanned model were processed to generate equivalent point
   clouds. For the PHMSR method, the similarity between the feature
   directions of the pulp horn and the surface normal vectors of the crown
   were used to determine the mapping points in the CBCT point cloud that
   have a great influence on the pulp pose. The small surface with
   adjustable parameters is reconstructed near the mapping point of the
   crown, and the new matching point pairs between the point and the
   mapping surface are searched. The sparse iterative closest point (ICP)
   algorithm is used to solve the new matching point pairs. Then, in the C
   + + programming environment with a point cloud library (PCL), the PHMSR,
   the traditional sparse ICP, ICP, and coherent point drift (CPD)
   algorithms are used to register the point clouds under two different
   initial deviations. The root square mean error (RSME) of the crown,
   crown-pulp orientation deviation (CPOD), and position deviation (CPPD)
   were calculated to evaluate the registration accuracy. The significance
   between the groups was tested by a two-tailed paired t-test (p < 0.05).
   Results The crown RSME values of the sparse ICP method (0.257), the ICP
   method (0.217), and the CPD method (0.209) were not significantly
   different from the PHMSR method (0.250). The CPOD and CPPD values of the
   sparse ICP method (4.089 and 0.133), the ICP method (1.787 and 0.700),
   and the CPD method (1.665 and 0.718) than for the PHMSR method, which
   suggests that the accuracy of crown-pulp registration is higher with the
   PHMSR method. Conclusion Compared with the traditional method, the PHMSR
   method has a smaller crown-pulp registration accuracy and a clinically
   acceptable deviation range, these results support the use of PHMSR
   method instead of the traditional method for clinical planning of root
   canal therapy.},

Abstract = {To improve the identification accuracy of target detection for
   intelligent vehicles, a real-time target detection system based on the
   multi-source fusion method is proposed. Based on the ROS melodic
   software development environment and the NVIDIA Xavier hardware
   development platform, this system integrates sensing devices such as
   millimeter-wave radar and camera, and it can realize functions such as
   real-time target detection and tracking. At first, the image data can be
   processed by the You Only Look Once v5 network, which can increase the
   speed and accuracy of identification; secondly, the millimeter-wave
   radar data are processed to provide a more accurate distance and
   velocity of the targets. Meanwhile, in order to improve the accuracy of
   the system, the sensor fusion method is used. The radar point cloud is
   projected onto the image, then through space-time synchronization,
   region of interest (ROI) identification, and data association, the
   target-tracking information is presented. At last, field tests of the
   system are conducted, the results of which indicate that the system has
   a more accurate recognition effect and scene adaptation ability in

Title = {Validation of a development methodology and tool for IoT-based systems
   through a case study for visually impaired people},
Journal = {INTERNET OF THINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In this article, we validate the Test-Driven Development Methodology for
   Internet of Things (IoT)based Systems (TDDM4IoTS) and its companion
   tool, called Test-Driven Development Tool for IoT-based Systems
   (TDDT4IoTS). TDDM4IoTS consists of 11 stages, including activities
   ranging from system requirements gathering to system maintenance. To
   evaluate the effectiveness of TDDM4IoTS and TDDT4IoTS, in the last four
   academic years from 2019, System Engineering students have developed
   several IoT-based systems as part of their training, from the sixth
   semester (third academic year). N \& SIM;awi (phonetically, Gnawi),
   which is the case study presented herein, is one of them, and intends to
   assist visually impaired people to move through open environments. N \&
   SIM;awi consists of a device, a mobile application and a web
   application. The device interacts with the environment and issues alerts
   to the user whenever it recognizes obstacles in their path. The mobile
   application targets two user roles: assisted person and caregiver.
   Assisted people can use the device and log in into a server when they
   leave home, so that the mobile application identifies and notifies
   obstacles in their path. All the collected data is gathered into the
   server, so that caregivers receive notifications and can monitor the
   location of their assisted people at any place and time. The web
   application allows caregivers to query and view more extensive
   information (details of events, trajectories, etc.). TDDM4IoTS has been
   evaluated regarding both the roles of the project members and the
   development cycle stages. A survey was used to evaluate the methodology.
   Out of a total of 47 respondents, 30 had used TDDM4IoTS and 96.66\% of
   them were very satisfied or satisfied, with nobody unsatisfied.},

Abstract = {Climate change is altering weather patterns, leading to increased
   variability in cloud cover, precipitation, and temperature. These
   changing patterns make it more challenging to accurately forecast solar
   radiation levels, which directly impact solar energy generation. This
   study, evaluates the solar energy potential using a real-time GSM-based
   communication system combined with an off-grid PV power plant in Tehran
   and Ahvaz, two regions in Iran with contrasting climates. To measure the
   output voltage, C++ language programming was used in Arduino\_IDE
   programming language was utilized along with an Arduino Nano board,
   ATmega328P microcontroller, and sensors for measuring current, voltage,
   temperature, humidity, and time. The recorded data was sent through
   short message service. The results were compared with simulations from
   PVsyst, PVGIS, and the Global Solar Atlas. The findings revealed that
   the PV power production potential in Tehran, which is characterized by a
   cold and wet climate, was 4.101 kwh.kwp-1 with a capacity factor of
   17.09\%. In contrast, Ahvas, with its warm and dry climate, had a
   potential of 3.271 kwh.kwp-1 and a capacity factor of 13.63\%. These
   values differed significantly from the estimates provided by PVsyst and
   the Global Solar Atlas. The Global Solar Atlas overestimated the PV
   potential by 15\% and 18.2\% in Tehran and Ahvaz, respectively, while
   PVsyst underestimated it by more than 15\% in both locations. The
   real-time energy production was measured at 246.1 Wh and 196.27 Wh,
   compared to the estimated values of 283 Wh and 232 Wh from the Global
   Solar Atlas, 178.36 Wh and 142.63 Wh from PVsyst, and 221.4 Wh and 196.9
   Wh from PVGIS in Tehran and Ahvaz, respectively. These results
   underscore the importance of accounting for recent climate changes when
   predicting near real-time solar generation, particularly in remote areas
   and regions that deviate from global trends.(c) 2023 The Authors.

Abstract = {Low-energy wireless wide-area networks are a key technology for the
   development of the Internet of Things. Like any wireless communications
   system, it requires that during the design the place where the network
   will be deployed be inspected to determine the locations where the
   signal is weak. Sigfox is a network with wireless access that provides
   the connectivity service for the Internet of Things. When the sensor
   nodes are located inside buildings, the level of the received signal can
   vary, due to internal obstructions and interference, so it is necessary
   to have systems that take into account the technical characteristics of
   the Sigfox network, to measure the levels. signal strength inside
   buildings and identify locations where there is no signal. The
   implemented system allows obtaining information on the signal levels
   inside the buildings in order to identify the locations in which the
   nodes do not have connectivity with the network and find solutions to
   this problem before implementing the network. The system implementation
   uses Sipy nodes programmed with Pymark and the Sigfox cloud, while the
   application development uses API and APIREST in the Visual Studio
   development environment.},

Title = {Modeling stack overflow tags and topics as a hierarchy of concepts},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {156},
Pages = {283-299},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Developers rely on online Q\&A forums to look up technical solutions, to
   pose questions on implementation problems, and to enhance their
   community profile by contributing answers. Many popular developer
   communication platforms, such as the Stack Overflow Q\&A forum, require
   threads of discussion to be tagged by their contributors for easier
   lookup in both asking and answering questions. In this paper, we propose
   to leverage Stack Overflow's tags to create a hierarchical organization
   of concepts discussed on this platform. The resulting concept hierarchy
   couples tags with a model of their relevancy to prospective questions
   and answers. For this purpose, we configure and apply a supervised
   multi-label hierarchical topic model to Stack Overflow questions and
   demonstrate the quality of the model in several ways: by identifying tag
   synonyms, by tagging previously unseen Stack Overflow posts, and by
   exploring how the hierarchy could aid exploratory searches of the
   corpus. The results suggest that when traversing the inferred
   hierarchical concept model of Stack Overflow the questions become more
   specific as one explores down the hierarchy and more diverse as one
   jumps to different branches. The results also indicate that the model is
   an improvement over the baseline for the detection of tag synonyms and
   that the model could enhance existing ensemble methods for suggesting
   tags for new questions. The paper indicates that the concept hierarchy
   as a modeling imperative can create a useful representation of the Stack
   Overflow corpus. This hierarchy can be in turn integrated into
   development tools which rely on information retrieval and natural
   language processing, and thereby help developers more efficiently
   navigate crowd-sourced online documentation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All

Journal = {SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Pages = {568-582},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Effective management of soil requires the spatial distribution of its
   various physical, chemical and hydrological properties. This is because
   properties, for example clay content, determine the ability of soil to
   hold cations and retain water. However, data acquisition is labour
   intensive and time-consuming. To add value to the limited soil data,
   remote sensing (e.g. airborne gamma-ray spectrometry) and proximal
   sensing, such as electromagnetic (EM) induction, are being used as
   ancillary data. Here, we provide examples of developing Digital Soil
   Maps (DSM) of soil physical, chemical and hydrological properties, for
   seven cotton-growing areas of southeastern Australia, by coupling soil
   data with remote and proximal sensed ancillary data. A greater challenge
   is how to get these DSM to a stakeholder in a way that is useful for
   practical soil use and management. This study describes how we
   facilitate access to the DSMs, using a simple-to-use web GIS platform,
   called terraGIS. The platform is underpinned by Google Maps API, which
   is an open-source development environment for building spatially enabled
   Internet applications. In conclusion, we consider that terraGIS and the
   supporting information, available on the sister web page (), allow easy
   access to explanation of DSM of soil properties, which are relevant to
   cotton growers, farm managers, consultants, extension staff,
   researchers, state and federal government agency personnel and policy
   analysts. Future work should be aimed at developing error budget maps to
   identify where additional soil and/or ancillary data is required to
   improve the accuracy of the DSMs.},

Abstract = {Objective. A promising application of BCI technology is in the
   development of personalized therapies that can target neural circuits
   linked to mental or physical disabilities. Typical BCIs, however, offer
   limited value due to simplistic designs and poor understanding of the
   conditions being treated. Building BCIs on more solid grounds may
   require the characterization of the brain dynamics supporting cognition
   and behavior at multiple scales, from single-cell and local field
   potential (LFP) recordings in animals to non-invasive
   electroencephalography (EEG) in humans. Despite recent efforts, a
   unifying software framework to support closed-loop studies in both
   animals and humans is still lacking. The objective of this paper is to
   develop such a unifying neurotechnological software framework. Approach.
   Here we develop the Simulink for Brain Signal Interfaces library
   (SimBSI). Simulink is a mature graphical programming environment within
   MATLAB that has gained traction for processing electrophysiological
   data. SimBSI adds to this ecosystem: 1) advanced human EEG source
   imaging, 2) cross-species multimodal data acquisition based on the Lab
   Streaming Layer library, and 3) a graphical experimental design
   platform. Main results. We use several examples to demonstrate the
   capabilities of the library, ranging from simple signal processing, to
   online EEG source imaging, cognitive task design, and closed-loop
   neuromodulation. We further demonstrate the simplicity of developing a
   sophisticated experimental environment for rodents within this
   environment. Significance. With the SimBSI library we hope to aid BCI
   practitioners of dissimilar backgrounds in the development of, much
   needed, single and cross-species closed-loop neuroscientific
   experiments. These experiments may provide the necessary mechanistic
   data for BCIs to become effective therapeutic tools.},

Abstract = {With the evolution of technology, and especially of the Internet, a
   growing interest has appeared for online education. The many advantages
   of e-Learning have made this teaching philosophy an ideal partner for
   teachers, either as a complement to regular education or as a substitute

   extra challenges for software developers, since there are other facets,

   the development of e-Learning systems method proposed in ADDIE with the
   model-based development of user interfaces and software quality

Abstract = {Studying developers' behavior in software development tasks is crucial
   for designing effective techniques and tools to support developers'
   daily work. In modern software development, developers frequently use
   different applications including IDEs, Web Browsers, documentation
   software (such as Office Word, Excel, and PDF applications), and other
   tools to complete their tasks. This creates significant challenges in
   collecting and analyzing developers' behavior data. Researchers usually
   instrument the software tools to log developers' behavior for further
   studies. This is feasible for studies on development activities using
   specific software tools. However, instrumenting all software tools
   commonly used in real work settings is difficult and requires
   significant human effort. Furthermore, the collected behavior data
   consist of low-level and fine-grained event sequences, which must be
   abstracted into high-level development activities for further analysis.
   This abstraction is often performed manually or based on simple
   heuristics. In this paper, we propose an approach to address the above
   two challenges in collecting and analyzing developers' behavior data.
   First, we use our ActivitySpace framework to improve the
   generalizability of the data collection. ActivitySpace uses
   operating-system level instrumentation to track developer interactions
   with a wide range of applications in real work settings. Secondly, we
   use a machine learning approach to reduce the human effort to abstract
   low-level behavior data. Specifically, considering the sequential nature
   of the interaction data, we propose a Condition Random Field (CRF) based
   approach to segment and label the developers' low-level actions into a
   set of basic, yet meaningful development activities. To validate the
   generalizability of the proposed data collection approach, we deploy the
   ActivitySpace framework in an industry partner's company and collect the
   real working data from ten professional developers' one-week work in

   confirms that with initial human-labeled training data, the CRF model
   can be trained to infer development activities from low-level actions
   with reasonable accuracy within and across developers and software
   projects. This suggests that the machine learning approach is promising
   in reducing the human efforts required for behavior data analysis.},

Title = {PPAM-mIoMT: a privacy-preserving authentication with device verification
   for securing healthcare systems in 5G networks},

Year = {2024},

Abstract = {In 5G, the next generation of technologies like the Internet of Medical
   Things (IoMT) cooperate with networking artifacts to provide seamless
   connectivity. To provide effective information sharing, the Internet
   infrastructure integrates various components of medical information
   systems such as computing devices, software tools, and application
   services. The information systems access a massive Internet of Medical
   Things (mIoMT) to discover a series of network infrastructures with
   technological innovations to offer remote diagnosis and treatment. In
   collecting healthcare information, innovative applications utilize
   medical sensor networks to drive extensive information processing
   including mobility support. However, the convergence of IoT and the
   cloud addresses the security gap while centralizing the devices into
   edge computing systems to protect the transmission flow through the
   device gateway. Considering this fact, an authentication scheme with
   privacy preservation was proposed using a key exchange protocol and
   digital signature by Soleymani et al. to guarantee data confidentiality
   and integrity. However, this scheme is still incapable of validating the
   integrity of data with the edge systems properly. Thus, this paper
   presents privacy-preserving authentication with device verification
   (PP-ADV) for securing healthcare systems in 5G networks. To protect the
   device privacy and server identities with registered users, the proposed
   PP-ADV utilizes two cryptographic primitives namely elliptic curve
   arithmetic and a collision-free hash function to achieve the significant
   properties of key agreement protocol including authenticity and
   confidentiality. Formal and informal analyses show that the proposed
   PPADV can restrict vulnerabilities such as privileged insider and
   forgery to achieve high-level privacy protection with seamless
   verification to improve system efficiency compared with other
   state-of-the-art approaches. Also, a board simulation testbed was
   designed using Raspberry Pi with Arduino IDE to examine the quality
   metrics including data transmission ratio, authentication delay, and
   throughput rate. The testbed analysis demonstrates that the proposed
   PP-ADV gains less delay approximate to 292.28s and improved throughput
   approximate to 87.73 to meet the design criteria of 5G-enabled remote
   healthcare systems.},

Abstract = {The integration with virtual reality is a new boost to CAD and CAE. This
   paper presents a research effort aimed at creating a desktop-based,
   low-cost and independent VR-based simulation system for glass pressing,
   which integrates the forming process simulation and mold motion

   Simulation of the mold The stereoscopic view of the virtual system is
   achieved by Crystal Eyes shutter glasses, with C++ language and OpenGL
   support library selected as the development tool. With the stereoscopic
   display of the mold design, pressing motion and numerical CAE results,
   the system enables engineers to gain a cohesive view of mold structure,
   assembly issues, and possible forming faults. it can also support
   training of students and engineers to acquire the theoretical know-how,

Title = {Increasing quality and managing complexity in neuroinformatics software
   development with continuous integration},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},
Abstract = {High quality neuroscience research requires accurate, reliable and well
   maintained neuroinformatics applications. As software projects become
   larger, offering more functionality and developing a denser web of
   interdependence between their component parts, we need more
   sophisticated methods to manage their complexity. If complexity is
   allowed to get out of hand, either the quality of the software or the
   speed of development suffer, and in many cases both. To address this
   issue, here we develop a scalable, low-cost and open source solution for
   continuous integration (CI), a technique which ensures the quality of
   changes to the code base during the development procedure, rather than
   relying on a pre-release integration phase. We demonstrate that a
   CI-based workflow, due to rapid feedback about code integration problems
   and tracking of code health measures, enabled substantial increases in
   productivity for a major neuroinformatics project and additional
   benefits for three further projects. Beyond the scope of the current
   study, we identify multiple areas in which CI can be employed to further
   increase the quality of neuroinformatics projects by improving
   development practices and incorporating appropriate development tools.
   Finally, we discuss what measures can be taken to lower the barrier for
   developers of neuroinformatics applications to adopt this useful
   technique.},

Title = {Capability-based localization of distributed and heterogeneous queries},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {27},
Abstract = {One key aspect of data-centric applications is the manipulation of data
   stored in persistent repositories, which is moving fast from querying a
   centralized relational database to the ad-hoc combination of
   constellations of data sources. The extension of general purpose
   languages with query operations is increasingly popular, as a tool to
   improve reasoning and optimizing capabilities of interpreters and
   compilers. However, not much is being done to integrate and orchestrate
   different and separate sources of data. We present a data manipulation
   language that abstracts the nature and location of data-sources. We
   define its semantics and a type directed query localization mechanism to
   be used in development tools for heterogeneous environments to
   efficiently compile them into native queries. We introduce a
   localization procedure based on rewriting of query expressions that is
   confluent, terminating and provides the maximum mapping between site
   capabilities and the structure of the query. We provide formal type
   safety results that support the sound distribution of query fragments
   over remote sites. Our approach is also suitable for an interactive
   query construction environment by rich user interfaces that provide
   immediate feedback on data manipulation operations. This approach is
   currently the base for the data layer of a development platform for
   mobile and web applications.},

Abstract = {Objective: To translate, cross-culturally adapt and validate the Sickle
   Cell Self-Efficacy Scale for application in the Brazilian cultural
   context.Methods: This is a methodological study performed in 6 steps:
   1-Forward translation; 2 Translation synthesis; 3-Back-translation;
   4-Assessment by expert committee, with computation of the Content
   Validity Index (CVI); 5-Cultural adequacy (pre-test); 6-
   Reproducibility. A pre-test was performed with the participation of 10
   adolescents/young adults with sickle cell disease through a telephone
   call and their responses were recorded on a form in a web platform. The
   instrument validation step was carried out with 55 adolescents/young
   adults with sickle cell disease, 43 of them having participated in the
   retest. The analysis of internal consistency and reproducibility was
   calculated using the Cronbach's alpha coeffi-cient and the Intraclass
   Correlation Coefficient (ICC), in the R statistical programming
   environment.Results: The translated instrument had good acceptance among
   the experts, reaching an average CVI of 1.0. In assessing reliability,
   the scale showed acceptable internal consistency, with a Cronbach's
   alpha of 0.84. In the agreement analysis, the ICC was 0.923 (95\% CI:
   0.857 to 0.958), which indicates good temporal reproducibility.
   Conclusions: Following the process of translation, cross-cultural
   adaptation and validation, we obtained the Brazilian version of the
   Sickle Cell Self-Efficacy Scale, considered valid and reliable to be
   applied to adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease in
   Brazil.\& COPY; 2022 Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. on behalf of

Abstract = {Complex graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that support a large amount of
   user interaction require a fast response time, a rich set of building
   blocks for an esthetic look-and-feel, and a development environment that

   offer more of these features than do server-side solutions. Java and
   JavaScript are the two most popular languages used for client-side GUI
   implementations. Java implementations require a user to download a
   plug-in that contains a virtual machine to execute the Java byte-code.
   The installation and maintenance of this plug-in is sometimes an
   unsurmountable barrier to using Java. JavaScript lacks some of the
   desirable features of Java, such as easy to use object-oriented features
   and having a GUI class Library, but does not require a plug-in, We have
   enhanced JavaScript by implementing a new language Object-JavaScript
   (OJS) and by providing an OJS library of GUI components, thus making it
   a viable alternative to Java. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons,

   the underpinning modelling, information management and knowledge
   representation technologies. This paper introduces a resource model that
   has been developed to support the dynamic, aggregate planning of

   during the formative stages of design. The main goal of aggregate
   planning is the measurement of product manufacturability and the
   evaluation of alternative design configurations and manufacturing
   scenarios, through the allocation of multiple parts to remote facilities
   within the supply network. The term `resource aware' planning is used to
   indicate the creation of a dynamic interrelationship between the
   planning entities (products and processes) and the enterprise resources,
   including humans and machines. The technologies employed for
   implementing the pilot methods include the aggregate resource modelling
   methodology, a web-centric co-development environment, unique methods
   for enriching planning entities with knowledge and evolutionary
   computing methods for the rapid generation and optimization of
   production routes. A pilot resource aware planning system has been
   implemented that supports many innovative modes of operation, the

   The familiar coordination problems of large scale software development
   reappear in a context where tools used by collaborators must be less
   tightly coupled to one another than before. To the traditional notion of
   scale, based on the size of software systems, must be added a new
   dimension of scale: organizational complexity. Designing configuration
   management systems that scale well over both dimensions requires
   difficult trade-offs between reliability and flexibility. At the heart
   of these trade-offs is the aggregate information shared by
   collaborators: how it is represented, maintained, and understood by the
   people and tools using it. While designing a prototype development
   environment intended to scale in both dimensions, we have revisited the
   role played by naming. A proposed extension to the prototype's naming
   system addresses issues such as which objects should be named and how
   the shared naming system is constructed.},

Abstract = {Education is key to a just and progressive society. It is specially

   end, this article presents the EduGene as the proof of concept.
   Applications generated with EduGene are compatible with four operating
   systems, Android (TM), Firefox (R) OS, macOS (R), and Windows Phone (R),
   and with the Web. Furthermore, EduGene is compatible with three types of
   devices: mobile (smartphones and tablets), desktop, and television. The
   evaluation results prove that EduGene is a user-friendly educational
   application generator, since it provides an intuitive interface that
   facilitates user interaction. The e-learning tools selected to perform
   EduGene's comparative evaluation are Moodle, Sakai, and ATutor. It is
   important to mention that the goal of the evaluation was only to
   highlight the benefits of EduGene as an educational app development
   tool.},

Abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are heterogeneous macromolecules that
   display a complex isoform profile as a result of the large series of
   modifications they can undergo. Product-related charge variants that are
   associated with a loss of biological activity or affected half-life and
   immunogenicity are especially important. Consequently, they are often
   considered critical quality attributes such that acceptance criteria and
   controls should be established. The characterization of rnAbs charge
   variants has long been a time and resource consuming task. Recent
   successes in the use of salt mediated pH gradient ion exchange
   chromatography with volatile mobile phases have shown there to be
   significant promise in using online mass spectrometric (MS) detection to
   facilitate peak detection.
   In this study, a newly developed 3 gm non-porous cation exchange column
   technology was investigated for its capability to be hyphenated to MS
   for the purpose of characterizing mAb charge variants. A 2 min ID format
   was selected for the ease of configuring it to classical MS ESI ion
   sources. A monoclonal antibody reference material from NIST (FtM 8671;
   NISTinAb) was used in its intact and IdeS/IgdE-digested forms to test
   for column performance and MS sensitivity. Furthermore, three different
   mAbs with highly basic isoelectric points (pI) were analyzed in their
   native and proteolyzed forms to demonstrate the straightforward
   application of the developed technique even with mAbs having strong
   retention on cation exchange media. The MS detection of low-abundance
   charge variant species ( < 0.1\%) demonstrated there to be acceptable
   sensitivity and dynamic range even from routine analyses. The capability
   of the column to separate different mAbs having high basic pI was
   demonstrated, and it was found that slight adjustment of ammonium
   acetate concentration in the eluent can be a convenient way to rapidly
   optimize a separation if necessary. Linearity was shown to exist between
   protein mass loads of 2.5 and 50 mu g while an optimal balance between
   chromatographic resolution and MS sensitivity was observed between 5 and
   10 mu g. Excellent run-to-run and column-to-column repeatability was
   achieved in terms of retention times, resolution and recovery.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the increasing popularity of casual games for mobile
   and web has promoted the development of new editors to make video games
   easier to create. The development of these interactive applications is
   on its way to becoming democratized, so that anyone who is interested,
   without any advanced knowledge of programming, can create them for
   devices such as mobile phones or consoles. Nevertheless, most game
   development environments rely on the traditional way of programming and
   need advanced technical skills, even despite today's improvements. This
   paper presents a new 2D game engine that reduces the complexity of video
   game development processes. The game specification has been simplified,
   decreasing the complexity of the engine architecture and introducing a
   very easy-to-use editing environment for game creation. The engine
   presented here allows the behaviour of the game objects to be defined
   using a very small set of conditions and actions, without the need to
   use complex data structures. Some experiments have been designed in
   order to validate its ease of use and its capacity in the creation of a
   wide variety of games. To test it, users with little experience in
   programming have developed arcade games using the presented environment
   as a proof of its easiness with respect to other comparable software.
   Results obtained endorse the concept and the hypothesis of its easiness
   of use and demonstrate the engine potential.},

Title = {Clinical evaluation of maxillary sinus floor elevation with or without
   bone grafts: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised
   controlled trials with trial sequential analysis},
Journal = {ARCHIVES OF MEDICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {384-401},
Abstract = {Introduction: Our goal was to systematically review the current evidence
   comparing the relative effectiveness of two maxillary sinus floor
   elevation (MSFE) approaches (internal and external) without bone grafts
   with that of conventional/grafted MSFE in patients undergoing
   implantation in the posterior maxilla. Material and methods: Medical
   databases (PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library)
   were searched for randomised controlled trials published between January
   1980 and May 2023. A manual search of implant-related journals was also
   performed. Studies published in English that reported the clinical
   outcomes of MSFE with or without bone material were included. The risk
   of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook Risk Assessment Tool.
   Meta-analyses and trial sequence analyses were performed on the included
   trials. Meta -regression analysis was performed using pre-selected
   covariates to account for substantial heterogeneity. The certainty of
   evidence for clinical outcomes was assessed using GRADEpro GDT online
   (Guideline Development Tool). Results: Seventeen studies, including 547
   sinuses and 696 implants, were pooled for the meta -analysis. The meta
   -analysis showed no statistically significant difference between MSFE
   without bone grafts and conventional MSFE in terms of the implant
   survival rate in the short term ( n = 11, I 2 = 0\%, risk difference
   (RD): 0.03, 95\% confidence intervals (CI): -0.01-0.07, p = 0.17,
   required information size (RIS) = 307). Although conventional MSFE had a
   higher endo-sinus bone gain ( n = 13, I 2 = 89\%, weighted mean
   difference (WMD): -1.24, 95\% CI: -1.91- -0.57, p = 0.0003, RIS = 461),
   this was not a determining factor in implant survival. No difference in
   perforation ( n = 13, I 2 = 0\%, RD = 0.03, 95\% CI: -0.02-0.09, p =
   0.99, RIS = 223) and marginal bone loss ( n = 4, I 2 = 0\%, WMD = 0.05,
   95\% CI: -0.14-0.23, p = 0.62, no RIS) was detected between the two
   groups using meta -analysis. The pooled results of the implant stability
   quotient between the two groups were not robust on sensitivity analysis.
   Because of the limited studies reporting on the visual analogue scale,
   surgical time, treatment costs, and bone density, qualitative analysis
   was conducted for these outcomes. Conclusions: This systematic review
   revealed that both non-graft and grafted MSFE had high implant survival
   rates. Owing to the moderate strength of the evidence and short -term
   follow-up, the results should be interpreted with caution.},

Title = {Security knowledge representation artifacts for creating secure IT
   systems},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {64},
Pages = {69-91},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The creation of secure applications is more than ever a complex task
   because it requires from system engineers increasing levels of knowledge
   in security requirements, design and implementation. In fact, the fast
   increasing size and volatility of this knowledge has reached a point in
   which it is unrealistic to expect that system engineers can keep up to
   date with it. The most prominent paradigm for addressing this problem is
   the use of security patterns to communicate security knowledge from
   experts to system designers. This, and other security artifacts, have
   proved their utility and benefits in the past years, improving the way
   security is taken into account by system engineers and developers. On
   the other hand, these artifacts have some limitations that have
   prevented them from becoming more widespread. In particular, security
   patterns are human-oriented and as such heavily based on natural
   language, which implies intrinsic high degrees of imprecision and
   ambiguity. In our opinion, we need to make the move from purely human
   oriented artifacts to hybrid artifacts that convey information for both
   humans (engineers and designers) and computer tools (engineering and
   development environments). Therefore, we have created a new security
   knowledge representation artifact that aims to cover the needs of system
   engineers and help them not only in applying a solution, but also in
   understanding the security aspects of a given domain as a highly-related
   set of security concepts (e.g. properties, requirements, solutions,
   etc.). This artifact, called Domain Security Metamodel (DSM), is, as its
   name suggests, domain-specific and contains information about all
   security aspects that are relevant in a specific domain (e.g. embedded
   systems, web services, etc.). The DSM contains security solutions that
   implement the security properties of the specific domains. That way,
   when users apply them into their system models the solutions for
   development time can be integrated directly and naturally. In order to
   describe our approach in a useful way we use a running example based on
   the Web Service Security (WS-Security) specification. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   BioC},
Journal = {DATABASE-THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL DATABASES AND CURATION},
Year = {2016},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {BioC is an XML-based format designed to provide interoperability for
   text mining tools and manual curation results. A challenge of BioC as a
   standard format is to align annotations from multiple systems. Ideally,
   this should not be a major problem if users follow guidelines given by
   BioC key files. Nevertheless, the misalignment between text and
   annotations happens quite often because different systems tend to use
   different software development environments, e.g. ASCII vs. Unicode. We
   first implemented the BioC Viewer to assist BioGRID curators as a part
   of the BioCreative V BioC track (Collaborative Biocurator Assistant
   Task). For the BioC track, the BioC Viewer helped curate protein-protein
   interaction and genetic interaction pairs appearing in full-text
   articles. Here, we describe the BioC Viewer itself as well as
   improvements made to the BioC Viewer since the BioCreative V Workshop to
   address the misalignment issue of BioC annotations. While uploading BioC
   files, a BioC merge process is offered when there are files from the
   same full-text article. If there is a mismatch between an annotated
   offset and text, the BioC Viewer adjusts the offset to correctly align
   with the text. The BioC Viewer has a user-friendly interface, where most
   operations can be performed within a few mouse clicks. The feedback from
   BioGRID curators has been positive for the web interface, particularly
   for its usability and learnability.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},

Month = {OCT 3},
Abstract = {Background and objective To take full advantage of decision support,
   machine learning, and patient-level prediction models, it is important
   that models are not only created, but also deployed in a clinical
   setting. The KETOS platform demonstrated in this work implements a tool
   for researchers allowing them to perform statistical analyses and deploy
   resulting models in a secure environment. Methods The proposed system
   uses Docker virtualization to provide researchers with reproducible data
   analysis and development environments, accessible via Jupyter Notebook,
   to perform statistical analysis and develop, train and deploy models
   based on standardized input data. The platform is built in a modular
   fashion and interfaces with web services using the Health Level 7 (HL7)
   Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard to access
   patient data. In our prototypical implementation we use an OMOP common
   data model (OMOP-CDM) database. The architecture supports the entire
   research lifecycle from creating a data analysis environment, retrieving
   data, and training to final deployment in a hospital setting. Results We
   evaluated the platform by establishing and deploying an analysis and end
   user application for hemoglobin reference intervals within the
   University Hospital Erlangen. To demonstrate the potential of the system
   to deploy arbitrary models, we loaded a colorectal cancer dataset into
   an OMOP database and built machine learning models to predict patient
   outcomes and made them available via a web service. We demonstrated both
   the integration with FHIR as well as an example end user application.
   Finally, we integrated the platform with the open source DataSHIELD
   architecture to allow for distributed privacy preserving data analysis
   and training across networks of hospitals. Conclusion The KETOS platform
   takes a novel approach to data analysis, training and deploying decision
   support models in a hospital or healthcare setting. It does so in a
   secure and privacy-preserving manner, combining the flexibility of
   Docker virtualization with the advantages of standardized vocabularies,
   a widely applied database schema (OMOP-CDM), and a standardized way to
   exchange medical data (FHIR).},

Abstract = {The aim of the study is to develop a GIS software package
   ``Epidemiological Atlas of Russia{''} on topical infectious and
   parasitic diseases in the Russian Federation to create an open and
   publicly accessible information resource allowing to improve the quality
   of morbidity epidemiological monitoring and analysis.
   Materials and Methods. The GIS software package ``Epidemiological Atlas
   of Russia{''} was designed for data monitoring, epidemiological
   analysis, and cartographic visualization and was implemented as a web
   resource consisting of a web application, a package administration
   module, and a database management system. The following development
   tools were used to create the package: JavaScript, PHP, additional
   mapping libraries (Leaflet, OpenStreetMap), MySQL database management
   systems, Visual Basic.NET. The primary information for the database was
   taken from official federal statistical observation forms No.1 and No.2
   ``Information on infectious and parasitic diseases{''}.
   Results. Analytical methods and GIS technologies used in epidemiological
   practice were evaluated, optimal technical solutions based on the
   experience of developing the ``Epidemiological Atlas of the Volga
   Federal District{''} were selected. A versatile database structure was
   designed and developed to create an array of input and output
   statistical values of an epidemiological nature. Original algorithms
   were created to obtain and evaluate epidemiological indicators. Web
   application ``Epidemiological Atlas of Russia{''} was developed to
   present, analyze, and visualize information on infectious and parasitic
   diseases in the subjects of a district, federal districts, and the
   Russian Federation as a whole. It allows to work with report forms of
   the Ministry of Health to organize federal statistical monitoring in the
   field of health protection and with laboratory studies results to create
   thematic modules providing detailed information on individual
   nosologies. Initial data were temporally broken down by months, and
   spatially, by Russian Federation subjects. All visualization results
   were dynamically updated and generated based on user's interactive
   request.
   Conclusion. GIS software package ``Epidemiological Atlas of Russia{''}
   was developed as an open and publicly accessible information resource
   and is designed to improve the quality of epidemiological monitoring,
   operational and retrospective epidemiological analysis of the incidence
   of current infectious and parasitic diseases in the Russian Federation.
   The package is intended for use in federal executive authorities, in
   supervisory authorities and institutions of Rospotrebnadzor, in medical

Abstract = {The standard tools for cloud computingprocessor and network
   virtualizationmake it difficult to achieve dependability, both in terms
   of real time operations and fault tolerance. Virtualization multiplexes
   virtual resources onto physical ones, typically by time division or
   statistical multiplexing. Time, in the virtual machine, is therefore as
   virtual as the machine itself. And fault tolerance is difficult to
   achieve when redundancy and independent failure in the virtual
   environment do not necessarily map to those properties in the physical
   environment. Virtualization adds a level of indirection that creates
   overhead, and makes it all but impossible to achieve predictable
   performance. Osprey uses an alternative to virtualization that achieves
   the same goals of scalability and flexibility but carries neither the
   overhead of virtualization, nor the restrictions on dependability. The
   result is a programming environment that achieves most of the
   compatibility offered by traditional virtualization efforts and provides
   much better and much more predictable performance. One technique we use
   is called Library OS, which stems from high-performance computing. The
   technique consists of linking applications with a library that
   implements most services normally provided by the operating system,
   creating an application that can run practically stand alone, or at
   least with a very minimal operating system. The Library OS approach
   moves the boundary between application and operating system down to a
   level where interactions with the operating system consist of
   sending/receiving messages (e.g., network packets) and scheduling
   resources (processor, memory, network bandwidth, and device access).
   These interactions, as we demonstrate, form a relatively weak bond
   between an application and the particular instance of the operating
   system on which it runsone that can be broken and re-established
   elsewhere. In fact, we make sure this is the case. Legacy applications
   that cannot be recompiled or relinked can make use of a Library OS
   server that runs as a tandem process along with the legacy application
   processes. System calls from the legacy process are catapulted into the
   Library OS server which executes them. Applications can still migrate,
   taking their server process along with them. (c) 2012 Alcatel-Lucent.},

Abstract = {Java programmers cannot help but be aware of the advent of C\#, the .NET
   network environment, and a host of new supporting technologies, such as
   Web services. Before taking the big step of moving all development to a
   new environment, programmers will want to know what are the advantages
   of C\# as a language over Java, and whether the new and interesting
   features of C\# and NET can be incorporated into existing Java software.
   This paper surveys the advantages of C\# and then presents and evaluates
   experience with connecting it to Java in a variety of ways. The first
   way provides evidence that Java can be linked to C\# at the native code
   level, albeit through C++ wrappers. The second is a means for retaining
   the useful applet feature of Java in the server-side architecture of Web
   services written in C\#. The third is by providing a common XML-based
   class for the development of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), which can
   be incorporated into Java or C\#. An added advantage of this system,
   called Views, is that it can run independently of the resource-intensive
   development environment that would otherwise be needed for using C\#. A
   major advantage of the methods described in this paper is that in all
   cases the Java program is not affected by the fact that it is
   interfacing with C\#. The paper concludes that there are many common
   shared technologies that bring Java and C\# close together, and that
   innovative ways of using others can open up opportunities not hitherto
   imagined. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {Background We are now moving beyond the focus of `child survival' to an
   era which promotes children thriving and developing rather than simply
   `surviving'. In doing so, we are becoming more aware of the large
   variation of child development screening tools available globally, but
   in particular, those in low/middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods
   This narrative review identifies 24 child development tools used in
   LMICs. We aimed to identify information on training accessibility and
   training design, assessment methods and cost of training. For those
   tools with no training information identified or for any tools
   identified as providing online training, the tool author was contacted
   individually to obtain information on the features of the tool's
   training package. Results Information on training features was
   identified for 18 tools. All of the tools are identified as screening
   tools with some also identified as surveillance or assessment tools. The
   training material for the majority of the tools was not readily
   accessible and most training packages were proprietary and only
   available with a face-to-face training design. Other training options
   included a user manual, training videos or training through an online
   platform. Conclusions Training is a key factor when selecting a child
   development screening or surveillance tool particularly in a low-income
   or middle-income setting where funds may be limited. The accessibility
   of training can have a key impact on the implementation and utilisation
   of tools desperately needed for use in LMICs.
   Essential to improvements in overall child health is an emphasis on
   helping children thrive as well as survive. This new emphasis will
   require a well-trained healthcare workforce in this regard. This paper
   reviews child development training packages in resource-limited
   settings.},

Abstract = {Progress in leveraging current and emerging high-performance computing
   infrastructures using traditional weather and climate models has been
   slow. This has become known more broadly as the software productivity
   gap. With the end of Moore's law driving forward rapid specialization of
   hardware architectures, building simulation codes on a low-level
   language with hardware-specific optimizations is a significant risk. As
   a solution, we present Pace, an implementation of the nonhydrostatic FV3
   dynamical core and GFDL cloud microphysics scheme which is entirely
   Python-based. In order to achieve high performance on a diverse set of
   hardware architectures, Pace is written using the GT4Py domain-specific
   language. We demonstrate that with this approach we can achieve
   portability and performance, while significantly improving the
   readability and maintainability of the code as compared to the Fortran
   reference implementation. We show that Pace can run at scale on
   leadership-class supercomputers and achieve performance speeds 3.5-4
   times faster than the Fortran code on GPU-accelerated supercomputers.
   Furthermore, we demonstrate how a Python-based simulation code
   facilitates existing or enables entirely new use cases and workflows.
   Pace demonstrates how a high-level language can insulate us from
   disruptive changes, provide a more productive development environment,
   and facilitate the integration with new technologies such as machine
   learning.},

Abstract = {Service-oriented architecture (SOA) takes an architectural approach to

   perspectives of the diffusion of innovations theory and the
   technology-organization-environment framework into one comprehensive
   model of SOA adoption. In order to validate the research instrument and
   to gauge the state of SOA adoption, an online survey was conducted among
   enterprise architects in South African organizations. The survey
   provides insights in the perceived risks, obstacles but also expected
   benefits of SOA adoption. The results also highlight a number of factors
   significantly influencing SOA adoption in South Africa. Use of multiple
   standards and platforms, compatibility, top management support, good
   governance and strategy, adequate human and financial resources, vendor
   support for integration and development tools are all significant
   factors for a fruitful SOA implementation. Finally, all of the above

Abstract = {PhD programs and graduate studies in robotics usually include motion
   planning among its main subjects. Students that focus their research in
   this subject find themselves trapped in the necessity of programming an
   environment where to test and validate their theoretic contributions.
   The programming of this robot motion planning environment is a big
   challenge. It requires on the one hand good programming skills involving
   the use of software development tools, programming paradigms, or the
   knowledge of computational complexity and efficiency issues. On the
   other hand it requires coping with different related issues like the
   modeling of objects, computational geometry problems and graphical
   representations and interfaces. The mastering of all these techniques is
   good for the curricula of roboticists with a motion planning profile.
   Nevertheless, the time and effort devoted to this end must remain
   reasonable. Within this framework, the aim of this paper is to provide
   the students with a roadmap to help them in the development of the
   software tools needed to test and validate their robot motion planners.

Title = {psc2code: Denoising Code Extraction from Programming Screencasts},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Progranuning screencasts have become a pervasive resource on the
   Internet, which help developers learn new progranuning technologies or
   skills. The source code in progranuning screencasts is an important and
   valuable information for developers. But the streaming nature of
   programming screencasts (i.e., a sequence of screen-captured images)
   limits the ways that developers can interact with the source code in the
   screencasts. Many studies use the Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
   technique to convert screen images (also referred to as video frames)
   into textual content, which can then be indexed and searched easily.
   However, noisy screen images significantly affect the quality of source
   code extracted by OCR, for example, no-code frames (e.g., PowerPoint
   slides, web pages of API specification), non-code regions (e.g., Package
   Explorer view, Console view), and noisy code regions with code in
   completion suggestion popups. Furthermore, due to the code
   characteristics (e.g., long compound identifiers like ItemListener),
   even professional OCR tools cannot extract source code without errors
   from screen images. The noisy OCRed source code will negatively affect
   the downstream applications, such as the effective search and navigation
   of the source code content in programming screencasts.
   In this article, we propose an approach named psc2code to denoise the
   process of extracting source code from programming screencasts. First,
   psc2code leverages the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image
   classification to remove non-code and noisy-code frames. Then, psc2code
   performs edge detection and clustering-based image segmentation to
   detect sub-windows in a code frame, and based on the detected
   subwindows, it identifies and crops the screen region that is most
   likely to be a code editor. Finally, psc2code calls the API of a
   professional OCR tool to extract source code from the cropped code
   regions and leverages the OCRed cross-frame information in the
   programming screencast and the statistical language model of a large
   corpus of source code to correct errors in the OCRed source code.
   We conduct an experiment on 1,142 programming screencasts from YouTube.
   We find that our CNN-based image classification technique can
   effectively remove the non-code and noisy-code frames, which achieves an
   F1-score of 0.95 on the valid code frames. We also find that psc2code
   can significantly improve the quality of the OCRed source code by truly
   correcting about half of incorrectly OCRed words. Based on the source
   code denoised by psc2code, we implement two applications: (1) a
   programming screencast search engine; (2) an interaction-enhanced
   programming screencast watching tool. Based on the source code extracted
   from the 1,142 collected programming screencasts, our experiments show
   that our programming screencast search engine achieves the precision@5,
   10, and 20 of 0.93, 0.81, and 0.63, respectively. We also conduct a user
   study of our interaction-enhanced programming screencast watching tool
   with 10 participants. This user study shows that our
   interaction-enhanced watching tool can help participants learn the
   knowledge in the programming video more efficiently and effectively.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) surgical simulations are among the most difficult
   software applications to develop mainly because of the type of user
   interactions that they must support. Surgery typically includes precise
   cutting of often intricate structures. Modelling these structures and
   accurately simulating their response to user interaction requires many
   software components to effectively work in unison. Some of these
   components are readily available but are tailored to more common
   applications such as computer games or open-world simulations such as
   flight-simulators. This article explores the software libraries that are
   currently available to developers of VR surgical simulation software.
   Like computer games and other VR simulations, VR surgical simulations
   require real-time lighting and rendering systems and physics-based
   interactions. However, in addition they require haptic interaction with
   cut-able and deformable soft-tissue, a key requirement that is not
   supported by the majority of the available tools. In this article, we
   introduce currently available software development tools and the
   specific benefits and limitations that can be encountered when using
   them to develop VR surgical simulations. We also provide a detailed
   review of collision detection libraries that are central to achieving
   reliable haptic rendering. Journal of Simulation (2013) 7, 101-108.

Abstract = {To swiftly and reliably monitor various information and the operational
   status of machinery across large smart manufacturing sites, this study
   introduces the use of LPWAN multi-mode network communication technology.
   This technology can automatically switch between LoRa and NB-IoT modes
   based on signal strength to ensure communication stability. Through
   wireless communication technologies such as LoRa and NB-IoT, the status
   information of machinery can be transmitted back to the cloud in
   real-time, facilitating user management. However, LPWAN multi-mode
   network communication modules often adopt a monolithic architecture,
   making maintenance and upgrades more difficult. When an application
   within the module needs upgrading, not only must the consistency between
   the development environment and the execution environment be ensured,
   but also a significant amount of time and resources must be spent on
   on-site deployment. With the development of cloud computing and
   virtualization technologies, containerized microservices architecture,
   which focuses on replacing functional modules with services, is set to
   become the mainstream for future industrial applications. Therefore,
   this study proposes a remote communication architecture based on
   container and microservices technologies. Utilizing the concept of
   microservices, this architecture divides LPWAN multi-mode network
   communication modules based on different functionalities and offers them
   to users in a more flexible service manner through containerization
   technology. This study also designs a mechanism to automate the entire
   service construction process, followed by the implementation of
   communication services' automatic deployment through container
   management tools. Compared to manual deployment, this significantly
   reduces the waste of time and human resources. Finally, this study uses
   a large mobile pumping unit as a practical application case to verify
   the feasibility of the proposed architecture. In the context of flood
   prevention and disaster relief, large mobile pumping units are widely
   used to solve flooding issues. These pumps are often deployed in
   dangerous areas with poor signal reception, thereby also validating the
   value of the proposed architecture.},

Abstract = {Nowadays there is a growing need of ubiquity for learning, research and
   development tools, due to the portability and availability problems
   concerning traditional desktop applications. In this paper, we suggest
   an approach to avoid any further download or installation. The main goal
   is to offer a collaborative and extensible web environment which will
   cover a series of domains highly demanded by different kinds of working
   groups, in which it is crucial to have tools which facilitate the
   exchange of information and the collaboration among their members. The
   result of those interactions would be the development of one or several
   diagrams accessible from any geographical location, independently of the
   device employed. The environment can be adapted through personalized
   components, depending on the type of diagram that the user wants to
   interact with and the users can also create new elements or search and
   share components with other users of the community. By means of this
   environment, it will be possible to do research on the usability of
   collaborative tools for design diagrams, as well as research on the
   psychology of group interactions, assessing the results coming from. the
   employment of known methodologies, techniques, paradigms or patterns,
   both at an individual and at a collaborative group level. Crown

   survey},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Graph grammars which generate graphs are a generalization of Chomsky
   grammars that generate strings. During the last decades there has been a
   remarkable development of graph grammars. Due to their wide diversity of
   applications, graph grammars have received a particular attention from
   many scientists and researchers. There has been applications of graph
   grammars in several areas such as pattern recognition, data base
   systems, biological developments in organisms, semantics of programming
   languages, compiler construction, software development environments,
   etc. In the literature, in some surveys, graph grammars have been
   studied and classified according to some criteria such as: parallel or
   sequential applicability of rules, embedding mechanism, type of
   generated graphs, etc. In addition to this, as data play an important
   role more and more in different domains, we survey in this paper the
   vast field of graph grammars by classifying them according to three
   criteria: the number of manipulated data (single or multiple types), the
   nature of data (structured or unstructured), and finally the kind of
   data (images, graphs, patterns, etc.). In particular, we consider that a
   graph grammar is well defined by five components instead of four,
   namely: type of generated graphs (T-G), a start graph (Z), a set of
   production rules (P), a set of additional specifications of the rules
   (A), and the criterion that we additionally consider which is the type
   of input and manipulated data (TD). This proposed formalism, especially
   with the added fifth component, may serve to overcome some issues
   related to Big Data and Cloud Computing domains. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {This article reports on the effect of textbook analysis as a tool of
   teacher professional development on nature of science (NOS)
   understanding of 10 science teachers in South Africa. The teacher
   professional development program (TPDP) was based on an explicit
   reflective methodology of textbook analysis and conducted online due to
   the Covid-induced lockdown. NOS understanding of the participant
   teachers was documented pre-training and post-training using a
   questionnaire designed by the researchers, termed the IFVNOS
   questionnaire. This tool was formulated based on the views of nature of
   science questionnaire version C (VNOSC) and the reconceptualised family
   resemblance approach (RFN) questionnaire. The same tool was used pre-
   and post-training. A comparison was made of the pre- and post-training
   results and it was found that there was a general individual increase in
   NOS understanding in 9 of the 10 teachers. The creative, scientific
   knowledge, science methods and ethical practices NOS aspects showed the
   greatest improvement in understanding by the teachers as a collective,
   whilst inferential NOS showed no overall change in understanding. This
   study showed that textbook analysis can be used as a professional
   development tool to improve NOS understanding of in-service science
   teachers.},

Journal = {THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {32},

Pages = {571-587},
Abstract = {Sport for Development and Peace (sdp) has been adopted as a `development
   tool' by Western development practitioners and a growing number of
   development organisations. Sport is frequently referred to as a `global
   language' and used to promote international awareness and cross-cultural
   understandingtwo key themes in global citizenship literature. In this
   paper I examine the language adopted by organisations promoting
   sdpspecifically, what sdp organisations say they do as well as the
   nature and implications of their discourses. Drawing on a large and
   growing body of literature on global citizenship and post-structuralism,
   and on post-colonial critiques, I argue that sdp narratives have the
   potential to reinforce the `Othering' of community members in developing
   countries and may contribute to paternalistic conceptions of development
   assistance. In so doing, they weaken the potential for more inclusive
   and egalitarian forms of global citizenship. The article examines the
   discourse of sdp organisational material found online and analyses it in
   the context of broader sport and colonialism literature. The work of SDP
   organisations is further examined in relation to global citizenship
   discourse with a focus on the production and projectionof global
   subjects, or objects of globalisation, and what this means for
   development `beneficiaries'.},

Title = {Pegylated Interferon Treatment for the Effective Clearance of Hepatitis
   B Surface Antigen in Inactive HBsAg Carriers: A Meta-Analysis},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {NOV 4},
Abstract = {Background: Expanding antiviral therapy to benefit more populations and
   optimizing treatment to improve prognoses are two main objectives in
   current guidelines on antiviral therapy. However, the guidelines do not
   recommend antiviral therapy for inactive hepatitis B surface antigen
   (HBsAg) carriers (IHCs). Recent studies have shown that antiviral
   therapy is effective with good treatment outcomes in IHC populations. We
   conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of HBsAg clearance and
   conversion in IHCs.
   Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Medline, and Web of Science to
   retrieve articles on HBsAg clearance in IHCs published between January
   2000 and August 2021. Data were collected and analysed using the
   random-effects model for meta-analysis.
   Results: A total of 1029 IHCs from 11 studies were included in this
   analysis. The overall HBsAg clearance rate was 47\% (95\% confidence
   interval (CI): 31\% - 64\%), with a conversion rate of 26\% (95\% CI:
   15\% - 38\%) after 48 weeks of Pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) treatment.
   In the control group (including nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) treatment or
   no treatment), the overall HBsAg clearance rate was only 1.54\% (95\%
   CI: 0.56\% - 3.00\%), which was markedly lower than that in the Peg-IFN
   group. Further analysis showed that a low baseline HBsAg level and long
   treatment duration contributed to a higher HBsAg clearance rate.
   Conclusion: This study showed that treatment of IHCs can be considered
   to achieve a clinical cure for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)
   infection. After Peg-IFN treatment, the HBsAg clearance rate was 47\%,
   and the conversion rate was 26\%, which are markedly higher than those
   reported by previous studies on Peg-IFN treatment in patients with
   chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A low baseline HBsAg level and long treatment
   duration were associated with HBsAg clearance in IHCs. Therefore,
   antiviral therapy is applicable for IHCs, a population who may be
   clinically cured.

Abstract = {in the digital age, information technology wields immense power to
   disseminate an unprecedented amount of information and knowledge
   inexpensively and ubiquitously. Information technology is no longer a
   luxury, but a development tool and a crucial means of information and
   knowledge exchange in the digital age. Therefore, people in the
   developing countries are offered unprecedented opportunities to acquire
   knowledge and enhance their educational systems. By using
   distance-learning technologies, research databases, or online digital
   libraries, it is estimated that researchers or students in developing
   countries would be enabled to get access to virtually the same
   electronic journals, books, and databases as their counterparts at the
   world's leading educational institutions. Hence, the universal
   realization of the right to development, the right to education, and the
   right to freedom of expression, enshrined in the major international and
   regional instruments for the protection of human rights, will be
   significantly reinforced in the digital age. Due to the widening digital
   divide and ever-expanding protection of copyright, however, this article

Abstract = {A generic platform for realizing an online brain-computer interface
   (BCI) named xBCI was developed. The platform consists of several
   functional modules (components), such as data acquisition, storage,
   mathematical operations, signal processing, network communication, data
   visualization, experiment control, and real-time feedback presentation.
   Users can easily build their own BCI systems by combining the components
   on a graphical-user-interface (GUI) based diagram editor. They can also
   extend the platform by adding components as plug-ins or by creating
   components using a scripting language. The platform works on multiple
   operating systems and supports parallel (multi-threaded) data processing
   and data transfer to other PCs through a network transmission control
   protocol/internet protocol or user datagram protocol (TCP/IP or UDP). A
   BCI system based on motor imagery and a steady-state visual evoked
   potential (SSVEP) based BCI system were constructed and tested on the
   platform. The results show that the platform is able to process
   multichannel brain signals in real time. The platform provides users
   with an easy-to-use system development tool and reduces the time needed
   to develop a BC! system. (C) 2010 Institute of Electrical Engineers of

Title = {Mining Unit Tests for Discovery and Migration of Math APIs},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Today's programming languages are supported by powerful third-party
   APIs. For a given application domain, it is common to have many
   competing APIs that provide similar functionality. Programmer
   productivity therefore depends heavily on the programmer's ability to
   discover suitable APIs both during an initial coding phase, as well as
   during software maintenance.
   The aim of this work is to support the discovery and migration of math
   APIs. Math APIs are at the heart of many application domains ranging
   from machine learning to scientific computations. Our approach, called
   MATHFINDER, combines executable specifications of mathematical
   computations with unit tests (operational specifications) of API
   methods. Given a math expression, MATHFINDER synthesizes pseudo-code
   comprised of API methods to compute the expression by mining unit tests
   of the API methods. We present a sequential version of our unit test
   mining algorithm and also design a more scalable data-parallel version.
   We perform extensive evaluation of MATHFINDER (1) for API discovery,
   where math algorithms are to be implemented from scratch and (2) for API
   migration, where client programs utilizing a math API are to be migrated
   to another API. We evaluated the precision and recall of MATHFINDER on a
   diverse collection of math expressions, culled from algorithms used in a
   wide range of application areas such as control systems and structural
   dynamics. In a user study to evaluate the productivity gains obtained by
   using MATHFINDER for API discovery, the programmers who used MATHFINDER
   finished their programming tasks twice as fast as their counterparts who
   used the usual techniques like web and code search, IDE code completion,
   and manual inspection of library documentation. For the problem of API
   migration, as a case study, we used MATHFINDER to migrate Weka, a
   popular machine learning library. Overall, our evaluation shows that
   MATHFINDER is easy to use, provides highly precise results across
   several math APIs and application domains even with a small number of
   unit tests per method, and scales to large collections of unit tests.},

Abstract = {In this paper we describe the sociotechnical structures of the Inquiry
   Learning Forum (ILF), a Web-based professional development tool designed
   to support a community of inservice and preservice mathematics and
   science teachers creating, sharing, and improving inquiry-based
   pedagogical practices, Founded in our previous research and consistent
   with our pedagogical commitment, the technical structures of the ILF
   have been designed around a ``visiting-the-classroom{''} metaphor. This
   decision was based on our belief that teachers need to be full
   participants in, and owners of, their virtual space for meaningful
   interaction to occur. The hallmark of this environment is that teachers
   with a broad range of experience and expertise can come together in an
   on-line environment to observe, discuss, and reflect on pedagogical
   theory and practice anchored to actual teaching vignettes. The goal of
   this paper is to share how we instantiated our pedagogical commitments
   and to describe the challenges we faced during the design, development,
   implementation, and analysis of the ILF. Toward this end, we walk the

Abstract = {We investigated the interdisciplinary `pillars' of scientific knowledge
   on which the emerging field of sustainability science is founded, using
   a bibliometric approach and data from the Web of Science database. To
   find this scientific basis, we first located publications that represent
   a relevant part of sustainability science and then extracted the set of
   best cited publications, which we called the highly cited knowledge base
   (HCKB). To find the research orientation in this set, we inspected the
   occurrence of fields and contrasted this with the occurrence of fields
   in other publication sets relevant to sustainability science. We also
   created a network of co-cited HCKB publications using the seed set
   citations, extracted communities or clusters in this network and
   visualised the result. Additionally, we inspected the most cited
   publications in these HCKB clusters. We found that themes related to the
   three pillars of sustainable development (environment, economy and
   sociology) are all present in the HCKB, although social science (not
   including economics) is less visible. Finally, we found increasing
   diversity of fields and clusters in the citations of the seed set,
   indicating that the field of sustainability science is not yet moving
   into a more transdisciplinary state.},

Title = {Spaced Education Faculty Development May Not Improve Faculty Teaching
   Performance Ratings in a Surgery Department},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION},

Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of spaced education as a
   faculty development tool designed to improve teaching skills in a
   surgery department.
   DESIGN: Faculty members were randomized to receive either weekly spaced
   education e-mails with content designed to improve teaching skills
   (group A) or no e-mails (group B). Using qualitative and quantitative
   surveys, we assessed both medical students' perception of faculty
   members' teaching effectiveness and faculty members' perception of the
   usefulness of the spaced education e-mails.
   SETTING: Academic medical center.
   PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-nine surgery faculty members with teaching
   responsibility for medical students in their Core Surgery Clerkship.
   RESULTS: All 41 medical students who rotated through the Core Surgery
   Clerkship rated the quality of teaching for each faculty members; 172
   online rating surveys were completed. Overall, faculty members received
   high ratings on the teaching skills included on the surveys.
   Additionally, no significant differences were found between the
   perceived skill level of the faculty members who received the weekly
   e-mails and those who did not. Specifically, 53.8\% and 54\% (p = 0.47)
   of the faculty were felt to deliver feedback more than three times per
   week; 87.1\% and 89.9\% (p = 0.15) of faculty were felt to deliver
   useful feedback; 89.2\% and 90.8\% (p = 0.71) of faculty were perceived
   to encourage student autonomy; and 78.1\% and 81.9\% (p = 0.89) of
   faculty were felt to set clear learning expectations for students.
   Postprogram comments from faculty revealed they did not find the e-mails
   useful as a faculty development tool.
   CONCLUSIONS: Students perceived high levels of teaching skills among the
   clinical faculty. Faculty members who received e-mail-based spaced
   education-based faculty development were not rated to be more effective
   teachers on the student surveys. Electronically based faculty
   development does not satisfy faculty expectations. (J Surg 69:52-57. (C)

Title = {Constructing Home Monitoring System with Node-RED},
Journal = {SENSORS AND MATERIALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {1701-1710},
Abstract = {The aim of this study is to design a home monitoring system with a
   simple and clear visual interface that integrates home appliances,
   disaster prevention, and surveillance facilities. Furthermore, the
   Node-RED visual development environment was utilized to create the
   system, and the users will be able to configure the environmental
   parameters by themselves with its simple and graphical programming
   interface, to customize the user interface. In this study, we utilize
   the Node-RED development software installed on a personal computer and
   the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) to communicate and
   exchange data with home devices under the publish/subscribe mode, so
   that the stability of data transmissions can be ensured while more
   resources are saved; in addition, MySQL database management tools are
   used to access the data stored in the home devices for the statistics
   and analysis of changes in environmental data. Moreover, the HyperText
   Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is also used to acquire various information
   from the government's open source data platform, and the information
   will be integrated and displayed on the Node-RED webpage interface.
   Since Node-RED uses a webpage interface, the devices that can use web
   browsers to view webpages, such as computers and smart phones, can thus
   be used to remotely monitor the Node-RED program. Finally, we utilize
   the Node-RED development software installed on a personal computer and
   MQTT to communicate and exchange data with the home devices under the
   publish/subscribe mode. The smart home system is divided into input and
   output parts, which control the electrical appliances and read the
   sensor information. Ten switches on the Web control interface are used
   to control the living room, kitchen, balcony, and bedroom light
   switches, air-conditioning, heating, exhaust fans, outdoor lights,
   doors, and alarm switches.},

Title = {Living history and the communication of archaeology with the public},
Journal = {ANNALES INSTITUTI ARCHAEOLOGICI},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {247-254},
Abstract = {Living history as a term encompasses a wide range of attempts at
   presenting the facts, objects, persons, and events from history. It can
   be defined as a pre-planned, historically researched, and appropriately
   equipped educational and touristic activity in which the participants
   follow a strict plan which brings some aspects of a historical event or
   period to life. It was present in classical Rome, and perhaps we can
   also speak of some earlier phenomena. In these cases, all the way to the
   very 20th century, living history usually did not have an educational
   purpose, it had religious or political, and propaganda purpose. We know
   of re-enactments of historical battles in Roman amphitheatres and other
   venues, be it land or naval battles (naumachiae). The medieval period
   also follows this pattern and there were new re-enactments of famous
   battles. Only from the 19th century onwards can we speak of the
   educational character that these events start to acquire, although
   political propaganda is still not completely removed from these
   activities even today, unfortunately. Today, this type of interpretation
   of history is approached through postmodern thought. Living history is
   analysed in the context of the change of today's approach to the past,
   as a community's attempt of constructing individual or group identity,
   living history as a manifestation of the search of our own, sensory,
   direct contact with the past and its interpretations, living history as
   a manifestation of commercializing the past, living history as a new
   form of teaching about the past, living history as a ludic phenomenon,
   living history as an element of the contemporary culture of history,
   living history as a form of new spirituality, and finally, living
   history as a form of popularization of archaeology (Pawleta 2018: 1025).
   The most common reasons for using techniques of living history are an
   efficient interpretation of material culture, testing of an assumption
   from archaeology or collecting data for research in history and
   ethnology, as well as simple participation in a recreational activity
   that can also have an educational purpose. The main tool of living
   history is interpretation as a communication process between the
   audience and the venue of living history through the direct experience
   of interaction with people and objects. Living history covers
   re-enactment of battles, but also scenes from everyday life, with the
   use of costumes and replicas produced using contemporary technology or
   methods of experimental archaeology. Experimental archaeology undeniably
   benefits from the techniques of living history, and archaeologists
   specialized in this subfield of archaeology are often members of living
   history societies. With various reconstructions of objects, venues, and
   activities, living history helps with research of all periods around the
   world, from the use of Palaeolithic spear-throwers, textile
   manufacturing, and the interpretation of the Iron Age in Europe, to the
   use of Roman shoes on long marches in full gear or construction of
   medieval forts.
   Besides in experimental archaeology and science in general, living
   history is a very efficient technique of popularization of archaeology
   and history as disciplines, and in the world, it proved to be the best
   interpretative tool and attracting factor for audiences to various
   events and archaeological parks across Europe. The technique of living
   history is used more and more in recent decades in Croatia as well, as
   part of events with the goal of popularization of archaeology, such as
   the antiquity festival ``Sepomaia Viva{''}, ``Dani Andautonije{''}
   (Andautonia days), ``Tisucljeca kulinarstva{''} (Millennia of culinary
   art), ``Dani Ad Turresa{''} (Ad Turres days), ``Cibalitanska noc{''}
   (Night in Cibalae), ``Rimske noci u Naroni{''} (Roman nights in Narona),
   ``Burnumske ide{''} (Ides of Burnum), ``Bakanalije{''} (Bacchanalia)
   festival, ``Halstatski dani{''} (Hallstatt days) event, and others.
   Recently, new forms of popularization of historical and archaeological
   disciplines thought the cooperation of archaeology and living history in
   Croatia, as can be seen in the example of the ``Legio VI Herculia{''}
   project of the Institute of Archaeology and Guardians of Zagreb
   association directed towards the reconstruction of military and civil
   life of Roman legion on the Roman Limes on the Danube river at the
   beginning of the 4th century. This project creates new content on
   multiple levels (live, through multimedia, online, interactively and in
   other ways) by presenting to Croatian, European and world public a
   so-far mostly unknown or inaccurately interpreted and presented
   historical period in Croatia - the period of the Roman rule at the
   beginning of the 4th century - using state- of-the-art methods.
   Moreover, this project shows tendencies of linking with current European
   and beyond projects (scientific, as well as the living history ones),
   but also the projects of local communities, creating a new kind of
   cultural cohesion in popularization and representation of historical
   content in cutting-edge methods.},

Title = {An educator's toolkit for virtual simulation: A usability study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {119},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: The rapid change brought on by COVID-19 meant that many
   educators adopted virtual simulation quickly, often without having a
   strong background in the pedagogical principles of virtual simulation.
   To address this resource gap, a team of 21 Ontario virtual
   simulation-experienced educators created the freely available, online,
   interprofessional Virtual Simulation Educator's Toolkit. The Toolkit
   provides the theory, practical strategies and resources needed to teach
   effectively with virtual simulation. Because the Toolkit would include
   new content, resources and numerous untested design elements, the team
   conducted a usability test.
   Design: A usability study, that followed a three-step process, was
   conducted. Participants were asked to carefully review the Toolkit,
   including all interactive components and complete an online survey based
   on the Technology Acceptance Model, to measure the ease of use and
   utility of the Toolkit. Lastly, participants were interviewed.
   Participants: In keeping with sampling principles for usability studies,
   twenty experienced virtual simulation educators from different
   disciplines participated in the study.
   Methods: A validated survey and one-on-one interviews were used to
   measure educators' perceptions of the ease of use and utility of the
   Toolkit and their recommendations to improve it. Quantitative data were
   analyzed using descriptive statistics and qualitative data were coded
   and themes developed.
   Conclusion: The score of 90 \% on the Toolkit Experience Survey
   indicated that participants found the Toolkit both easy to use and
   useful. Results from the interviews indicated that a practical,
   accessible professional development tool is urgently needed to support
   education with virtual simulation. Because the Toolkit introduces
   educators to different ways of implementing virtual simulation, as well
   as options, process considerations, and tools to enhance their teaching
   with virtual simulation, different disciplines and educators with
   different levels of simulation experience may benefit by using it.},

Title = {eHealth policy framework in Low and Lower Middle-Income Countries; a
   PRISMA systematic review and analysis},
Journal = {BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Background Low and lower middle-income countries suffer lack of
   healthcare providers and proper workforce education programs, a greater
   spread of illnesses, poor surveillance, efficient management, etc.,
   which are addressable by a central policy framework implementation.
   Accordingly, an eHealth policy framework is required specifically for
   these countries to successfully implement eHealth solutions. This study
   explores existing frameworks and fills the gap by proposing an eHealth
   policy framework in the context of developing countries.Methods This
   PRISMA-based (PRISMA Preferred Reporting Items For Systematic Reviews
   and Meta-Analyses) systematic review used Google Scholar, IEEE, Web of
   Science, and PubMed latest on 23(rd) May 2022, explored 83 publications
   regarding eHealth policy frameworks, and extracted 11 publications
   scrutinizing eHealth policy frameworks in their title, abstract, or
   keywords. These publications were analyzed by using both expert opinion
   and Rstudio programming tools. They were explored based on their
   developing/developed countries' context, research approach, main
   contribution, constructs/dimensions of the framework, and related
   categories. In addition, by using cloudword and latent semantic space
   techniques, the most discussed concepts and targeted keywords were
   explored and a correlation test was conducted to depict the important
   concepts mentioned in the related literature and extract their relation
   with the targeted keywords in the interest of this study.Results Most of
   these publications do not develop or synthesize new frameworks for
   eHealth policy implementation, but rather introduce eHealth
   implementation frameworks, explain policy dimensions, identify and
   extract relevant components of existing frameworks or point out legal or
   other relevant eHealth implementation issues.Conclusion After a thorough
   exploration of related literature, this study identified the main
   factors affecting an effective eHealth policy framework, found a gap in
   the context of developing countries, and proposed a four-step eHealth
   policy implementation guideline for successful implementation of eHealth
   in the context of developing. The limitation of this study is the lack
   of a proper amount of practically implemented eHealth policy framework
   cases in developing countries published in the literature for the
   review. Ultimately, this study is part of the BETTEReHEALTH (More
   information about the BETTEReHEALTH project at ) project funded by the
   European Union Horizon's 2020 under agreement number 101017450.},

Title = {A field study of the Wheel - a usability engineering process model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {79},
Number = {6},
Pages = {841-858},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Interactive system developers are increasingly including usability
   engineering as an integral part of interactive system development. With
   recognition of the importance of usability come attempts to structure
   this new aspect of overall system development, leading to a variety of
   processes and methodologies. Unfortunately, these processes often lack
   flexibility, customizability, completeness, and breadth of coverage.
   This paper describes our development of a meta process or process model
   that we call the Wheel. This innovative approach to creating and
   tailoring usability engineering processes addresses these shortcomings,
   and describes an evaluation of its application in a real-world
   commercial development environment.
   The Wheel process model for usability engineering is not a process
   itself, but instead, it provides a general framework into which
   developers can fit specific existing or new techniques, methods, or
   activities to apply ``best usability practices{''}. It grew out of our
   examination. adaptation. and extension of several existing usability
   engineering and software methodologies. The methods that most strongly
   guided creation of the Wheel were the LUCID framework of interaction
   design, the Star life cycle of usability engineering, and the waterfall
   and spiral models of software engineering. The resulting process model
   assumes the form of a sequence of distinct cycles (each of which
   produces a product form), allowing developers to focus on each cycle
   separately. Each cycle has the same four activity types: Analyze.
   Design. Implement, and Evaluate. Each activity type in a cycle is
   instantiated using an existing usability engineering technique.
   Working with an Internet technology company in northern Virginia under
   grant sponsorship from the Virginia Center for Innovative Technology (a
   research and development incubator for the Commonwealth of Virginia), we
   instantiated the Wheel process model and used it to develop a Web-based
   device management system. The process model performed remarkably well
   for this development environment. overcoming the tight constraints of
   budget and schedule cuts to produce an excellent process instance that
   resulted in a demonstration prototype of the company's target system.

   to 22 October 2021. This meta-analysis was performed using the fixed- or
   random-effects model. Continuous outcomes were carried out using mean
   difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95\%
   confidence interval (CI). Dichotomous outcomes were determined using
   risk ratio (RR) with 95\%CI. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment,
   Development and Evaluations (GRADE)pro Guideline Development Tool (GDT)
   online software was used to present outcome-specific information
   regarding overall certainty of evidence from studies. Results: In total,
   15 studies including 1,236 participants were finally included. Compared
   with usual care alone, Tai Chi combined with usual care achieved
   efficacy in improving Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire
   (MD = -8.51; 95\% CI: -10.32 to -6.70; p < 0.00001), 6-min walk test (MD
   = 43.47; 95\% CI: 33.38 to 54.10; p < 0.00001), left ventricular
   ejection fraction (MD = 6.07; 95\% CI: 3.44 to 8.70; p < 0.00001),
   B-type natriuretic peptide/N-terminal fragment of pro-BNP (SMD = -1.12;
   95\% CI: -1.70 to -0.54; p = 0.0002), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
   (MD = -2.89; 95\% CI: -4.87 to -0.91; p = 0.004), Pittsburgh Sleep
   Quality Index (MD = -2.25; 95\% CI: -3.88 to -0.61; p = 0.007), timed up
   and go test (MD = -1.34; 95\% CI: -2.50 to -0.19; p = 0.02), and reduced
   the risk of heart failure hospitalization (RR = 0.47; 95\% CI: 0.25 to
   0.88; p = 0.02). However, there was no difference in the outcome of peak
   oxygen uptake (MD = 1.38; 95\% CI: -1.51 to 4.28; p = 0.35). All-cause
   mortality or cardiovascular death could not be evaluated due to
   insufficient data. The certainty of evidence ranged from very low to
   moderate due to the risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, and
   publication bias. Conclusion: Tai Chi might be safe and showed
   beneficial effects on health status in patients with CHF. However, more
   high-quality and long-term studies are still needed to further evaluate
   the effects of Tai Chi.},

Title = {Automatically visualise and analyse data on pathways using PathVisioRPC
   from any programming environment},
Journal = {BMC BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {16},
Month = {AUG 23},
Abstract = {Background: Biological pathways are descriptive diagrams of biological
   processes widely used for functional analysis of differentially
   expressed genes or proteins. Primary data analysis, such as quality
   control, normalisation, and statistical analysis, is often performed in
   scripting languages like R, Perl, and Python. Subsequent pathway
   analysis is usually performed using dedicated external applications.
   Workflows involving manual use of multiple environments are time
   consuming and error prone. Therefore, tools are needed that enable
   pathway analysis directly within the same scripting languages used for
   primary data analyses. Existing tools have limited capability in terms
   of available pathway content, pathway editing and visualisation options,
   and export file formats. Consequently, making the full-fledged pathway
   analysis tool PathVisio available from various scripting languages will
   benefit researchers.
   Results: We developed PathVisioRPC, an XMLRPC interface for the pathway
   analysis software PathVisio. PathVisioRPC enables creating and editing
   biological pathways, visualising data on pathways, performing pathway
   statistics, and exporting results in several image formats in multiple
   programming environments. We demonstrate PathVisioRPC functionalities
   using examples in Python. Subsequently, we analyse a publicly available
   NCBI GEO gene expression dataset studying tumour bearing mice treated
   with cyclophosphamide in R. The R scripts demonstrate how calls to
   existing R packages for data processing and calls to PathVisioRPC can
   directly work together. To further support R users, we have created
   RPathVisio simplifying the use of PathVisioRPC in this environment. We
   have also created a pathway module for the microarray data analysis
   portal ArrayAnalysis.org that calls the PathVisioRPC interface to
   perform pathway analysis. This module allows users to use PathVisio
   functionality online without having to download and install the software
   and exemplifies how the PathVisioRPC interface can be used by data
   analysis pipelines for functional analysis of processed genomics data.
   Conclusions: PathVisioRPC enables data visualisation and pathway
   analysis directly from within various analytical environments used for
   preliminary analyses. It supports the use of existing pathways from
   WikiPathways or pathways created using the RPC itself. It also enables
   automation of tasks performed using PathVisio, making it useful to
   PathVisio users performing repeated visualisation and analysis tasks.

Title = {Influence of the Urban Built Environment on Physical and Mental Health

Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUL 21},
Abstract = {With the advent of the information technology revolution and the
   Internet era, information technology is gradually occupying an important
   position and becoming an important strategic factor in economic
   development. As an emerging technology that has been developing
   continuously in recent years, big data is becoming an important industry
   to improve the innovation and development of the urban economy. Like AI
   technology, cloud computing, and the Internet, big data has become an
   important application technology for economic growth and economic
   efficiency improvement in today's world. It is an effective means of
   progress and development in a region and an important strategic
   resource. As a new technology, big data has attracted more and more
   attention from all walks of life. Many companies have turned their
   attention to developing big data for economic benefits. ``Enjoy your old
   age{''} is the yearning of every old man and his family. In recent
   years, the national level has been committed to ``creating an urban
   built environment for the elderly to achieve healthy aging.{''} From the
   perspective of promoting the physical and mental health of the elderly,
   this paper analyzes the impact of the urban built environment on the
   physical and mental health of the elderly based on the needs of the
   elderly and puts forward countermeasures and suggestions based on the
   current status and existing problems of the urban built environment for
   the elderly. Based on the combined data analysis method and technology
   in big data, this paper conducted a field questionnaire survey on a
   total of 4,000 elderly people in urban and rural areas by means of the
   questionnaire survey. It is found that the existing problems of the
   built environment in the old cities include scattered content, one-sided
   understanding, and rigid design. According to the problems, the
   solutions of building consensus, paying attention to planning, combining
   urban characteristics, and the joint efforts of all sectors of society
   are put forward. And programming tools are used to combine formulas and
   analyze related data in detail. The analysis results show that the
   physical and mental health index of the elderly is highly correlated
   with factors such as changes in the consensus degree of the urban built
   environment, urban built environment planning, urban built environment
   policy support, and multiparty efforts in the urban built environment.
   Changes show a positive change.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {63},
Number = {1},
Pages = {81-93},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {BackgroundHuman identification can be reliably established by dental
   comparison; success is significantly impacted by inadequate ante-mortem
   information. Previous Australian research revealed suboptimal recording
   of features important for forensic dental identification and compliance
   with Dental Board of Australia guidelines. We hence created and
   evaluated an online education programme aimed at improving oral health
   practitioner recording.
   MethodsAn interactive learning module (ILM) was constructed and released
   to three focus groups representing practitioners with varying experience
   levels: Australian Society of Forensic Odontology members, third year
   dental students and the wider dental community. Pre- and
   post-participation perceptions were recorded, with percentage, mean,
   broad agreement, standard deviation and statistical significance between
   responses determined.
   ResultsImproved recognition of importance of record keeping, knowledge,
   confidence, skill and motivation to learn was seen following ILM
   interaction. This was particularly significant for students,
   participants with 3-5 years of experience in their current occupation
   and those whose highest level of education was achieved in Australia.
   ConclusionsThe ILM increased self-reported awareness, understanding and
   attitude of participants with different levels of case note recording
   experience; this can improve recording practises and aid forensic dental
   identification if utilized in undergraduate teaching and as a continuing
   professional development tool for dental practitioners.},

Abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used in clinical settings to
   investigate neuropathology. Since EEG signals contain a wealth of
   information about brain functions, there are many approaches to
   analyzing EEG signals with spectral techniques. In this study, the
   short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and wavelet transform (WT) were
   applied to EEG signals obtained from a normal child and from a child
   having an epileptic seizure. For this purpose, we developed a program
   using Labview software. Labview is an application development
   environment that uses a graphical language G, usable with an online
   applicable National Instruments data acquisition card. In order to
   obtain clinically interpretable results, frequency band activities of
   delta, theta, alpha and beta signals were mapped onto frequency-time
   axes using the STFT, and 3D WT representations were obtained using the
   continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Both results were compared, and it
   was determined that the STFT was more applicable for real-time
   processing of EEG signals, due to its short process time. However, the
   CWT still had good resolution and performance high enough for use in
   clinical and research settings. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Predictability is considered the most distinguishing characteristic of
   real-time systems. Besides that, adaptability is also a very important
   attribute because RT systems are usually designed for long life cycles,
   during which they will have to cope with change. This paper presents the
   STER real-time software development environment, designed to support the
   production of predictable, and yet flexible, distributed real-time
   systems. Flexibility is one of the main concerns of STER's programming
   model, based on the construction of reusable software modules. Modules
   can be reused with different timing constraints without having to be
   recoded, since the specification of their timing constraints is
   decoupled from their implementation. Predictable temporal behavior is
   obtained by an integrated allocation and scheduling strategy that
   involves off-line and online schedulers. The off-line scheduler tries to
   satisfy timing, precedence and allocation constraints of periodic hard
   real-time tasks, and to give the necessary leeway for the dynamic
   scheduling of aperiodic tasks. The paper shows how distributed programs
   are translated to scheduling graphs, and gives the results of some
   experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of the off-line
   algorithm. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All Fights reserved.},

Abstract = {Motivation: Computational multiscale models help cancer biologists to

   reveal the underlying mechanism of emergent properties.
   Results: To facilitate the construction of such models, we have
   developed a next generation modelling platform for cancer systems
   biology, termed `ELECANS' (electronic cancer system). It is equipped
   with a graphical user interface-based development environment for
   multiscale modelling along with a software development kit such that
   hierarchically complex biological systems can be conveniently modelled
   and simulated by using the graphical user interface/software development
   kit combination. Associated software accessories can also help users to
   perform post-processing of the simulation data for visualization and
   further analysis. In summary, ELECANS is a new modelling platform for
   cancer systems biology and provides a convenient and flexible modelling
   and simulation environment that is particularly useful for those without
   an intensive programming background.

Abstract = {The expert system component of Knowledge Base System supports the
   analysis and interpretation phases of ventilation design with an
   algorithmic program used for the solution of alternate design. The paper
   describes the `ES-VENT' knowledge based system developed at Central
   Mining Research Institute, Dhanbad, India for an on-line diagnosing of
   the ventilation problems using the `IITMRULE' expert system development
   tool. In the `IITMRULE' expert system tool, it has been decided to use a
   backward chaining reasoning process to reach the goal state i.e. the
   final conclusion. ES-VENT system is made of three modules: online Data,
   Diagnostics and KBS, Each module is being a collection of several
   programs. The paper mainly deals with the parameters affecting the
   ventilation of underground mines such as air-velocity, air pressure,
   temperature, dust, and humidity and gas contents. The graphical
   presentation of these parameters on the computer and the interactive
   part of the developed program is expected to help a ventilation officer
   to determine the changes in a ventilation circuit necessary to bring the
   mine ventilation to the desired value. once such changes are physically
   effected, the display will indicate if the changes have brought the
   desired effect or not on ventilation.},

Title = {Geena 2, improved automated analysis of MALDI/TOF mass spectra},
Journal = {BMC BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {Background: Mass spectrometry (MS) is producing high volumes of data
   supporting oncological sciences, especially for translational research.
   Most of related elaborations can be carried out by combining existing
   tools at different levels, but little is currently available for the
   automation of the fundamental steps. For the analysis of MALDI/TOF
   spectra, a number of pre-processing steps are required, including
   joining of isotopic abundances for a given molecular species,
   normalization of signals against an internal standard, background noise
   removal, averaging multiple spectra from the same sample, and aligning
   spectra from different samples. In this paper, we present Geena 2, a
   public software tool for the automated execution of these pre-processing
   steps for MALDI/TOF spectra.
   Results: Geena 2 has been developed in a Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP web
   development environment, with scripts in PHP and Perl. Input and output
   are managed as simple formats that can be consumed by any database
   system and spreadsheet software. Input data may also be stored in a
   MySQL database. Processing methods are based on original heuristic
   algorithms which are introduced in the paper. Three simple and intuitive
   web interfaces are available: the Standard Search Interface, which
   allows a complete control over all parameters, the Bright Search
   Interface, which leaves to the user the possibility to tune parameters
   for alignment of spectra, and the Quick Search Interface, which limits
   the number of parameters to a minimum by using default values for the
   majority of parameters. Geena 2 has been utilized, in conjunction with a
   statistical analysis tool, in three published experimental works: a
   proteomic study on the effects of long-term cryopreservation on the low
   molecular weight fraction of serum proteome, and two retrospective serum
   proteomic studies, one on the risk of developing breat cancer in
   patients affected by gross cystic disease of the breast (GCDB) and the
   other for the identification of a predictor of breast cancer mortality
   following breast cancer surgery, whose results were validated by ELISA,
   a completely alternative method.
   Conclusions: Geena 2 is a public tool for the automated pre-processing
   of MS data originated by MALDI/TOF instruments, with a simple and
   intuitive web interface. It is now under active development for the
   inclusion of further filtering options and for the adoption of standard
   formats for MS spectra.},

Abstract = {Recently, the increased handling of online standards information has
   emerged as an important feature of information and communications
   technology (ICT) standardization. In order to meet market needs for
   on-time standards deployment, most standards organizations are actively
   seeking more efficient ways of standardization using electronic means in
   order to accelerate the standards making process. This paper suggests a
   virtual standard development environment designed for standards
   developers to carry out their standards-related activities on-line. In
   this paper, we outline a conceptual model of a concurrent
   standardization process and describe the design and implementation of an
   Extranet-based network system called standards information cooperative
   network (SICN). The system was created with a view to fostering faster
   standards development with functionalities such as a virtual management
   of networked standards developers, collaboration support tools, a
   workflow-based electronic signature system, and dynamic links for ready
   retrieval of standards information stored in a database. We conclude
   this paper with an introduction to the concept of a virtual standards
   development organization (VSDO) that supports all the features needed by
   the relevant standards making bodies to carry out their activities in a
   dynamic on-line environment.},

   product design},
Journal = {INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT \& DATA SYSTEMS},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {106},
Number = {5-6},
Pages = {680-699},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this research is to develop a prototype of
   agent-based intelligent workflow system for product design collaboration
   in a distributed network environment.
   Design/methodology/approach - This research separates the collaborative
   workflow enactment mechanisms from the collaborative workflow building
   tools for flexible workflow management. Applying the XML/RDF (resource
   description framework) ontology schema, workflow logic is described in a
   standard representation. Lastly, a case study in collaborative
   system-on-chip (SoC) design is depicted to demonstrate the agent-based
   workflow system for the design collaboration on the web.
   Findings - Agent technology can overcome the difficulty of
   interoperability in cross-platform, distributed environment with
   standard RDF data schema. Control and update of workflow functions
   become flexible and versatile by simply modifying agent reasoning and
   behaviors.
   Research limitations/implications - When business partners want to
   collaborate, how to integrate agents in different workflows becomes a
   critical issues.
   Practical implications - Agent technology can facilitate design
   cooperation and teamwork communication in a collaborative, transparent
   product development environment.
   Originality/value - This research establishes generalized flow logic RDF
   models and an agent-based intelligent workflow management system, called
   AWfMS, based on the RDF schema of workflow definition. AWfMS minimizes
   barriers in the distributed design process and hence increases design
   cooperations among partners.},

Abstract = {The scientific community's growing interest in green marketing research
   can be traced through the abundance of published literature on the
   topic. However, there is still a lack of a comprehensive and systematic
   research focusing on the evolution of this field. The main objective of
   this paper was to consolidate the state-of-the-art research on green
   marketing through a bibliometric study of articles published from 1977
   to 2020, and to analyze and present the results from the perspective of
   growing trends in the field; productive and influential countries,
   institutions, authors, articles, and research journals; keywords;
   authorship patterns; and international collaborations. The study results
   indicate a gradual increase in green marketing research from 1977 to
   2020, more so in the last five years. A total of 1025 scholarly
   documents were published in 634 journals during this period and listed
   in the Web of Science (WOS). The top 10 most productive countries were
   then analyzed. A great number of institutions from both developing
   countries (in terms of article count) and developed countries (in terms
   of citation scores), were compared. Finally, based on keywords and a
   three-factor analysis, it was concluded that green marketing,
   sustainability, sustainable development, environment marketing and
   sustainable marketing have attracted extensive attention during the past
   decade as keywords.},

Abstract = {Product development is collaborative, involving multi-disciplinary
   functions and heterogeneous tools. Teamwork is essential through
   seamless tool integration and better co-ordination of human activities.
   This paper proposes to use workflow management as a mechanism to
   facilitate the teamwork in a collaborative product development
   environment where remote Web-based Decision Support Systems (TeleDSS)
   are extensively used by team members who are geographically distributed.
   The workflow of a project is modelled as a network. Its nodes correspond
   to the work (packages), and its edges to flows of control and data. The
   concept of agents is introduced to define nodes and the concept of
   messages to define edges. As a sandwich layer, agents act as
   special-purpose application clients for the remote TeleDSS application
   servers. Agents are delegated to manipulate the corresponding TeleDSS on
   behalf of their human users. Details of the proceedings are recorded by
   agents as their properties for future references or shared uses by other
   team members. Through flow messages, agents are able to share input and
   output data and request for remote services. One of the major
   contributions is that agents, once defined, can be reused for different
   projects without any changes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Journal = {CLIMATE SERVICES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Projections Tool for Architectural Design (PTAD) is a web-based climate
   service product available at www.ptad. mju.ac.th. Targeted at building
   owners and designers, it is intended to support these decision makers in
   building design to reduce the impacts of climate change. This study
   presents the technical environment of PTAD and provides a conceptual
   basis for linking academic information on climate change to
   building-related data with the cooperation of the relevant authorities.
   The PTAD development concept was divided into three parts: climate
   change impact assessment in small areas (i.e., at a construction site
   scale), building damage analysis of the impacts, and climate-resilient
   recommendations for building design. Tools such as GIS, HEC-RAS, and
   ERDAS and the existing outputs of regional climate models were used as
   the baseline data for analyzing the impacts that may occur at the study
   site. The impacts in small areas and design strategies to reduce the
   potential damage were analyzed with the Delphi technique using existing
   standards and guidelines. A 3-tier architecture was employed for the
   production and development environments by modularizing the user
   interface, service object, and data storage layers. The impact data
   values, namely, the highest annual surface temperatures and flood
   characteristics, including the maximum flood level, flood duration, and
   water velocity from 1998 to 2047, were displayed as markers on the
   satellite maps, tables, and figures. The impacts can be linked to
   architectural design guidelines to help design buildings that mitigate
   some of the impacts of climate change.},

Title = {Innovative design of an art teaching quality evaluation system based on
   big data and an association rule algorithm from the perspective of
   sustainable development},
Journal = {SOFT COMPUTING},

Abstract = {Online art courses suffer from poor course production, limited
   sustainable use and development, and a significant degree of course
   similarity. It is important to figure out how to create an efficient
   system for evaluating art instruction. In this article, we look at the
   current institutions of higher art education and how to use data mining
   techniques in the system for judging the quality of teaching. Using an
   association rule algorithm to solve the current teaching quality
   evaluation of rationality and subjectivity and a teaching quality
   evaluation algorithm based on association were some of the solutions
   used, and data mining effectively dredged out the indicators of the
   institutions of higher art education's teaching quality evaluation
   system. The widely used development tools, SQL Server and ASP.NET, were
   used to build and implement the teaching quality assessment system
   through a variety of indications of teaching quality evaluation in a
   school. The main contribution of this paper is the development of an
   effective teaching quality evaluation system index for higher art
   colleges, as well as the development of teacher-student interaction
   based on the comprehensive support of the Internet, in order to identify
   the factors influencing the teaching quality of design art colleges. The
   administrators of higher art education institutions will receive
   analytical materials for making decisions from this study that are based
   on science and objectivity. The results of the experimental process were
   quite effective.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveTo develop a Chinese Diabetes Mellitus Ontology (CDMO) and
   explore methods for constructing high-quality Chinese biomedical
   ontologies.Materials and methodsWe used various data sources, including
   Chinese clinical practice guidelines, expert consensus, literature, and
   hospital information system database schema, to build the CDMO. We
   combined top-down and bottom-up strategies and integrated text mining
   and cross-lingual ontology mapping. The ontology was validated by
   clinical experts and ontology development tools, and its application was
   validated through clinical decision support and Chinese natural language
   medical question answering.ResultsThe current CDMO consists of 3,752
   classes, 182 fine-grained object properties with hierarchical
   relationships, 108 annotation properties, and over 12,000 mappings to
   other well-known medical ontologies in English. Based on the CDMO and
   clinical practice guidelines, we developed 200 rules for diabetes
   diagnosis, treatment, diet, and medication recommendations using the
   Semantic Web Rule Language. By injecting ontology knowledge, CDMO
   enhances the performance of the T5 model on a real-world Chinese medical
   question answering dataset related to diabetes.ConclusionCDMO has
   fine-grained semantic relationships and extensive annotation
   information, providing a foundation for medical artificial intelligence
   applications in Chinese contexts, including the construction of medical
   knowledge graphs, clinical decision support systems, and automated
   medical question answering. Furthermore, the development process
   incorporated natural language processing and cross-lingual ontology
   mapping to improve the quality of the ontology and improved development
   efficiency. This workflow offers a methodological reference for the
   efficient development of other high-quality Chinese as well as
   non-English medical ontologies.},

   Following this, we conducted a transnational modified Delphi followed by
   an online survey sampling the global pharmacy leadership community.
   Finally, a series of case studies was constructed exemplifying the
   framework implementation.ResultsInitial validation resulted in a
   modified draft competency framework comprising 34 developmental
   competencies across six clusters. Each competency has three phases of
   advancement to support practitioner progression. The modified Delphi
   stage provided feedback on framework modifications related to cultural
   issues, including missing competencies and framework comprehensiveness.
   External engagement and case study stages provided further validity on
   the framework implementation and dissemination.ConclusionThe four-staged
   approach demonstrated transnational validation of a global advanced

   exercises on the musculoskeletal system have been demonstrated. However,
   previous research findings on osteoporosis are inconsistent, and it is
   unclear which type of exercise and its frequency and duration have the
   best effect on osteoporosis. This study aims to investigate the most
   appropriate exercise modality for people with osteoporosis through
   systematic evaluation and network meta-analysis to guide clinical
   practice. Methods and analysisThe Cochrane Library, Web of Science,
   MEDLINE, Embase, China Biomedical Literature, China Knowledge Network,
   China Science and Technology Journal and Wanfang databases will be
   searched until January 2022. The language of the articles should be
   English or Chinese. All clinical randomised controlled trials on the
   effect of traditional Chinese exercises on osteoporosis will be
   included. We will use RevMan, Stata and GeMTC software to complete our
   network meta-analysis. We will perform risk of bias assessment, subgroup
   analysis and sensitivity analysis to correct the results. Finally, we
   will use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and

Abstract = {Present day sophisticated and innovative attacks have resulted in
   exponentially increasing security problems. This paper therefore
   presents a three-phased threat-oriented security model to meet the above
   security challenges as a part of proactive risk management. This model
   is based on a spiral process for software development because it is a
   risk driven approach and provides an incremental method for a
   progressively growing system with decreasing risk. Integration of threat
   management during the development process in the proposed work provides
   necessary security cover against both unforeseen and known threats.
   Identification of these threats has been made possible by fusion of a
   threat modeling process and research honeytokens in conjunction with a
   statistical model in the first phase. Necessary security measures to
   mitigate the above identified threats have been adopted in the second
   phase using multiagent system planning. Risk reduction as a result of
   adoption of countermeasures has been evaluated in the third phase using
   meta-agents in association with fuzzy logic in a multiagent environment.
   The proposed proactive measures of this model have been demonstrated
   with a case study on `Online Banking' to show its feasibility and has
   been implemented using Java Agent Development Environment, Apache Tomcat
   Server, with MySQL Server at the backend. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley

Title = {The appropriation of GitHub for curation},
Journal = {PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Month = {OCT 9},
Abstract = {GitHub is a widely used online collaborative software development
   environment. this paper, we describe curation projects as a new category
   of GitHub project that collects, evaluates, and Preserves resources for
   software develoPers. We investigate: (1) what motivates software
   developers to curate resources; (2) why curation has occurred on GitHub;
   (3) how curated resources are used by software developers; and (4) how
   the GitHub platform could better support these practices. We conduct
   in-depth interviews with 16 software developers, each of whom hosts
   curation projects on GitHub. Our results suggest that the motivators
   that inspire software developers to curate resources on GitHub are
   similar to those that motivate them to participate in the development of
   open source projects. Convenient tools (e.g. Markdown syntax and Git
   version control system) and the opportunity to address professional
   needs of alarge number of peers attract developers to engage in curation
   projects on GitHub. Benefits of curating on GitHub include learning
   opportunities, support for develoPment work, and professional
   interaction. However, curation is limited by GitHub's document
   structure, format, and a lack of key features, such as search. In light
   of this, we propose design possibilities to encourage and improve
   appropriations of GitHub for curation.},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {This paper describes a meta-design approach to the development of online
   services for citizens of a government agency. The goal is to transfer
   the development of government-to-citizen services from professional
   software developers to administrative employees, without forcing
   employees to acquire any programming skills. The approach encompasses
   two main phases. The first phase analyzes the different perspectives of
   the stakeholders involved in service creation and usage - employees,
   citizens, software developers and human-computer interaction specialists
   - in order to derive a meta-model of e-govemment services. The latter
   applies the meta-model to design and develop an end-user development
   environment that properly supports employees in creating an instance of
   the service meta-model, which is then automatically interpreted to
   generate the service pages for citizens. A pilot application of the
   proposed approach is illustrated with reference to a specific class of
   e-government services offered by the Brescia Municipality, even though
   the approach is general enough to be applied to different kinds of
   e-government services and application domains. The results of the
   evaluation with a group of municipality employees provide initial
   feedback from the government field and show how to proceed along this
   research direction. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {While incorporating project-based exercise is a common practice in
   software engineering education, few studies have been conducted in
   investigating how real-world project development influences university
   students' proactive learning and knowledge transformation. This study
   aims to evaluate the effectiveness of developing real-world projects
   with industry engagement in encouraging students to apply knowledge to
   practice and be more proactive in learning. Using a two-group, post-test
   quasi-experimental design, the performance between the students taking
   real-world project development and the students in the control group are
   compared using descriptive statistics, the independent samples (-test
   and Welch (-test, accordingly. Both the Spearman's rank-order and
   Kendall's tau-b are used to examine the relationship between students'
   practical works and the level of knowledge transformation estimated by
   the students through online surveys. The results suggest that using
   real-world projects in the classroom can be an effective motivational
   device for proactive learning and knowledge transformation.
   Project-based exercise should be both comprehensive and keeping pace
   with technology development driven by the software industry evolution to
   be more effective. The direct interaction with stakeholders, dynamic
   requirements change, employment of Agile methods, self-organising teams,
   and using challenging real-world projects, are essential in simulating a
   real-world software development environment in the classroom.},

   instructional dashboard},
Journal = {MEDICAL TEACHER},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 20},
Abstract = {What was the educational challenge?Diminishing emphasis on pharmacology
   education in medical schools has resulted in a concerning lack of
   prescribing knowledge among physician graduates. These concerns mirror
   our graduates' expressed dissatisfaction with the structure and quality
   of pharmacology educational experiences over the past 5 years. What was
   the solution?PharmaCORE, a web-based instructional dashboard, was
   developed as an interactive faculty development tool to enhance
   integration and instruction of pharmacology content in pre-clinical
   curriculum at a US medical school. How was the solution
   implemented?PharmaCORE was introduced in Spring 2022 for instructors
   teaching pharmacology in the pre-clinical curriculum. Instructors used
   the dashboard to assess coverage of specific drug topics throughout the
   curriculum and to apply tailored, learner-centered teaching strategies
   to optimize learner engagement and comprehension. What lessons were
   learned that are relevant to a wider global audience?The initial
   assessment indicated that the dashboard was user-friendly and positively
   influenced instructor awareness of pharmacology content and
   learner-centered teaching. This faculty development approach underscores
   the importance of skill-based mapping and maintaining learner-centered
   teaching standards to address other integrated subjects and broader
   curricular challenges. What are the next steps?This study lays the
   foundation for the broader applicability of instructional dashboards in
   tracking and addressing curricular challenges across pharmacology and
   other science subjects. Future steps include more personalized feedback
   for instructors, creating a student-accessible version, and ongoing
   monitoring of maintenance measures like milestone exams.},

Abstract = {The effort to continuously improve and innovate smart appliances (SA)
   energy management requires an experimental research and development
   environment which integrates widely differing tools and resources
   seamlessly. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Direct Load Control
   (DLC) testbed, aiming to conveniently support the research community, as
   well as analyzing and comparing their designs in a laboratory
   environment. Based on the LabVIEW computing platform, this original
   testbed enables access to knowledge of major components such as online
   weather forecasting information, distributed energy resources (e.g.,
   energy storage, solar photovoltaic), dynamic electricity tariff from
   utilities and demand response (DR) providers together with different
   mathematical optimization features given by General Algebraic Modelling
   System (GAMS). This intercommunication is possible thanks to the
   different applications programming interfaces (API) incorporated into
   the system and to intermediate agents specially developed for this case.
   Different basic case studies have been presented to envision the
   possibilities of this system in the future and more complex scenarios,
   to actively support the DLC strategies. These measures will offer enough
   flexibility to minimize the impact on user comfort combined with support
   for multiple DR programs. Thus, given the successful results, this
   platform can lead to a solution towards more efficient use of energy in
   the residential environment.},

Abstract = {A contest-oriented project for undergraduate students to learn
   implementation skills and theories related to intelligent mobile robots
   is presented in this paper. The project, related to Micromouse,
   Robotrace (Robotrace is the title of Taiwanese and Japanese robot
   races), and line-maze contests was developed by the embedded control
   system research group of the Department of Electronic Engineering,
   Lunghwa University of Science and Technology, Taiwan. It targets both
   those students who have to earn credits for a one-year special topics
   course and those who are just interested in making robots, and it is
   designed to motivate them to learn digital motion control, path
   planning, attitude correction, curvature detection and maze-solving
   algorithms. The students begin by getting acquainted with the
   development environment of microcontrollers, the characteristics of
   different sensors, and servomotor control techniques. Having learned
   these basic skills, they acquire further specific advanced skills and
   proceed to design their own mobile robots to compete in contests. The
   special topics course students' robots must pass examination by five
   teachers. Blogs and a wiki Web site for recording students' progress and
   experiences enhance the project's learning outcomes. Although not every
   student wins a prize in the contests, student feedback still shows that
   the contest-oriented project did motivate them to acquire the skills
   necessary to build and operate intelligent mobile robots.},

Title = {Non-adaptive programmability of random oracle},
Journal = {THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {592},
Pages = {97-114},
Month = {AUG 9},
Abstract = {Random Oracles serve as an important heuristic for proving security of
   many popular and important cryptographic primitives. But, at the same
   time they are criticized due to the impossibility of practical
   instantiation. Programmability is one of the most important features
   behind the power of Random Oracles. Unfortunately, in the standard hash
   functions, the feature of programmability is limited. In recent years,
   there have been endeavors to restrict programmability of random oracles.
   However, we observe that the existing models allow adaptive programming,
   that is, the reduction can program the random oracle adaptively in the
   online phase of the security game depending on the query received from
   the adversary, and thus are quite far from the standard model.
   In this paper, we introduce a new feature called non-adaptive
   programmability of random oracles, where the reduction can program the
   random oracle only in the pre-processing phase. In particular, it might
   non-adaptively program the RO by setting a regular function as a
   post-processor on the oracle output. We call this new model
   Non-Adaptively-Programmable Random Oracle (NAPRO) and we show that this
   model is actually equivalent to so-called Non-Programmable Random Oracle
   (NPRO) introduced by Fischlin et al. {[}8], hence too restrictive.
   However, we also propose a slightly stronger model, called
   Weak-Non-Adaptively-Programmable Random Oracle (WNAPRO), where in
   addition to non-adaptive programming, the reduction is allowed to
   adaptively extract some ``auxiliary information{''} from the RO and this
   ``auxiliary information{''} interestingly plays crucial role in the
   security proof allowing several important RO proofs to go through! In
   particular we prove the following results in WNAPRO model.
   1. RSA-Full-Domain Hash signature scheme (RSA-FDH), and Boneh Franklin
   ID-based encryption scheme (BF-IDE) are secure in the WNAPRO model. This
   is in sharp contrast to strong blackbox proofs of FDH schemes, where
   full programmability seems to be necessary.
   2. Shoup's Trapdoor-permutation based Key-encapsulation Mechanism
   (TDP-KEM) cannot be proven secure via blackbox reduction from ideal
   trapdoor-permutations in the WNAPRO model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Objective: Create a visual mobile end user development framework, named
   Puzzle, which allows end users without IT background to create, modify
   and execute applications, and provides support for interaction with
   smart things, phone functions and web services.
   Methods: Design of an intuitive visual metaphor and associated
   interaction techniques for supporting end user development in mobile
   devices with iterative empirical validation.
   Results: Our results show that the jigsaw is an intuitive metaphor for
   development in a mobile environment and our interaction techniques
   required a limited cognitive effort to use and learn the framework.
   Integration of different modalities and usage of smart things was
   relevant for users.
   Conclusion: Puzzle has addressed the main objective. The framework
   further contributes to the research on mobile end user development in
   order to create an incentive for users to go beyond consuming content
   and applications to start creating their own applications. Practice:
   Usage of a mobile end user development environment has the potential to
   create a shift from the conventional few-to-many distribution model of
   software to a many-to-many distribution model. Users will be able to
   create applications that fit their requirements and share their
   achievements with peers. Implications: This study has indicated that the
   Puzzle visual environment has the potential to enable users to easily
   create applications and stimulate exploration of innovative scenarios
   through smartphones. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Software development cycles in the context of Internet of Things (IoT)
   applications require the orchestration of different technological
   layers, and involve complex technical challenges. The engineering team
   needs to become experts in these technologies and time delays are
   inherent due to the cross-integration process because they face steep
   learning curves in several technologies, which leads to cost issues, and
   often to a resulting product that is prone to bugs. We propose a more
   straightforward approach to the construction of high-quality IoT
   applications by adopting model-driven technologies (DIME and Pyrus),
   that may be used jointly or in isolation. The presented use case
   connects various technologies: the application interacts through the
   EdgeX middleware platform with several sensors and data analytics
   pipelines. This web-based control application collects, processes and
   displays key information about the state of the edge data capture and
   computing that enables quick strategic decision-making. In the presented
   case study of a Stable Storage Facility (SSF), we use DIME to design the
   application for IoT connectivity and the edge aspects, MongoDB for
   storage and Pyrus to implement no-code data analytics in Python. We have
   integrated nine independent technologies in two distinct Low-code
   development environments with the production of seven processes and
   pipelines, and the definition of 25 SIBs in nine distinct DSLs. The
   presented case study is benchmarked with the platform to showcase the
   role of code generation and the reusability of components across
   applications. We demonstrate that the approach embraces a high level of
   reusability and facilitates domain engineers to create IoT applications
   in a low-code fashion.},

   activities for building a balanced segmental circle. This approach was
   chosen to build the Odesa National University of Technology (ONUT)

   easy tool for identifying how much and what type of attention a research
   output has received. The software was developed in the PyCharm and

   application was created that fully meets the requirements of Odesa
   National University of Technology Scientific and Technical Library. The
   analysis of the subject area is carried out. The database was designed

   Caregivers for Older Adults: A Bibliometric Analysis},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {As global populations continue to undergo demographic aging, the role of
   caregivers in providing essential support and assistance to older adults
   has become increasingly prominent. This demographic shift has led to a
   growing reliance on informal caregivers, often family members, who take
   on the responsibilities of caring for older adults. This not only
   affects immediate family dynamics but also holds broader implications
   for societal sustainability. The primary objective of this bibliometric
   analysis is to comprehensively examine the worldwide research output
   related to the quality of life and caregiver burden among individuals
   providing care to older adults. By understanding the worldwide research
   output related to caregivers and their quality of life and burden, we
   can assess the long-term sustainability of caregiving practices. We
   retrieved studies with titles containing the terms ``caregivers{''},
   ``burden{''}, ``quality of life{''}, and ``aged{''} from the Web of
   Science (WOS) database. The collected publications were then subjected
   to analysis using the ``bibliometric{''} package in the R programming
   environment. A total of 44 publications from 2006-2023 were included in
   the analysis. Spain emerged as the leading contributor in terms of the
   number of publications, accounting for 21.9\%, followed by the USA at
   16.5\% and China at 13.6\%. The most prolific institution was Kaohsiung
   Medical University, Taiwan, responsible for 25\% of the publications.
   Among the authors, Cura-Gonzalez I.D. had the highest number of
   articles, contributing four publications, or 9.1\% of the total output.
   An analysis of co-occurring keywords revealed that the predominant focus
   of the research revolved around caregiver burden, quality of life,
   health, care, stress, and impact, reflecting enduring areas of interest
   within this field. This bibliometric analysis may serve as a tool to
   provide insights into the current state of research on caregiver burden
   and quality of life among those caring for older adults. The results of
   this study can contribute to the assessment of research strategies and
   the encouragement of global cooperation in the field of care for older
   adults. By considering the multidimensional nature of caregiving
   challenges and promoting international cooperation, strides can be made
   towards sustainable caregiving practices that ensure the wellbeing of
   both caregivers and the aging population, thus safeguarding the
   sustainability of healthcare systems worldwide.},

Volume = {2021},
Month = {MAR 8},
Abstract = {In this paper, the optimization of the enterprise HR information system
   is studied based on IoT first-off technology, the system demand phase is
   analysed, and the edge control system is designed and built. The
   hardware and software system and edge node management platform are
   implemented first, and then the communication scenarios between the edge
   layer of the system and the sensing layer, the edge layer, and the cloud
   layer are analysed, and the business type-driven link selection
   algorithm and the northbound multilink switching algorithm are designed
   and implemented, respectively, to guarantee the communication
   reliability between different layers of the system. Based on the
   implementation of the above functions, the edge control system can meet
   the intelligence, expandability, and security requirements of IoT
   applications. An in-depth investigation and research are launched mainly
   on the enterprise demand to determine the functional requirements and
   performance requirements of the enterprise and to achieve the basic
   logical structure; in the system design phase, the system architecture
   and other aspects of the design are realized. According to the
   conditions of the system function structure, a number of system module
   functions are designed in detail. The system is composed of the
   following modules, namely, personnel change management, organization
   management, and salary and benefits management. The system consists of
   the following modules, namely, personnel change management, organization
   management, compensation and benefits management, and personnel
   information management. The system modules run through the process of
   human resource management; in the system implementation stage, the
   system coding and page operation are realized based on the development
   tools and software development techniques. The system finally achieves
   the system design objectives and is put on a trial operation to meet its
   actual business requirements.},

Abstract = {Objectives/Hypothesis: Learning portfolios, as defined by the
   Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), are
   professional development tools for resident education. Moreover, the
   scope of portfolio use is expanding to become a component of the
   accreditation system, with likely mandatory implementation by 2016. The
   objective of this study is to describe the extent of portfolio use in
   otolaryngology training programs and resident attitudes toward
   portfolios.
   Study Design: Cross-sectional survey.
   Methods: All residents in ACGME-accredited otolaryngology programs were
   contacted via email linked to an online survey. One follow-up email was
   sent after initial notification.
   Results: Three hundred eighteen (22\%) of the 1,431 invited residents
   responded to the survey, representing 65 of 103 ACGME-accredited
   otolaryngology training programs. Fifty-eight percent of the programs
   represented had residents who maintained a portfolio. When asked to what
   extent portfolios enhanced education, 39\% of residents who kept a
   portfolio found them helpful, 27\% were neutral, and 35\% did not find
   them helpful, although 60\% plan to use their portfolio after residency.
   For those residents who did not maintain a portfolio, 70\% cited they
   did not maintain a portfolio because it is not a requirement in their
   program. Twenty-one percent of all respondents felt that portfolios
   should be mandatory, whereas 61\% felt that portfolios should be
   encouraged, but not required.
   Conclusions: Although portfolios are encouraged by the ACGME, and will
   ultimately become mandatory, they are not yet fully integrated in
   otolaryngology training programs. Only a minority of residents in this
   study thought portfolios enhanced education.},

Title = {A realist review of digitally delivered child development assessment and
   screening tools: Psychometrics and considerations for future use},
Journal = {EARLY HUMAN DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {183},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: Developmental screening improves the detection of
   developmental concerns, yet numerous children are not screened/assessed.
   Remote child developmental tool administration has been utilized to
   increase screening and assessment accessibility. Method: We conducted a
   realist review to: (1) identify existing multi-domain child development
   assessment and screening tools for children 0-5 years; (2) review
   psychometric data on their digital (i.e., only administered remotely)
   administration; and (3) explore contextual factors relevant to their
   digital administration. We searched APA PsycInfo, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and
   ERIC to identify tools and papers on their psychometrics. We
   referencesearched included articles and searched Google for relevant
   grey literature. Results: Of 33 multi-domain child development tools
   identified in objective one, five tools (in five studies) were delivered
   digitally and compared to traditional (e.g., paper) delivery (i.e.,
   objective two). Studies evaluated within-group equivalence reliability
   (k = 2) and between-group equivalence (k = 3). Within-group equivalence
   reliability was established for the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales,
   and domains (e.g., gross motor) of the Ages and Stages Questionnaires
   2nd edition (ASQ-2) and Revised Prescreening Denver Questionnaire
   (R-PDQ). Between group equivalence was demonstrated for Developmental
   Neuropsychological Assessment, 2nd Edition (NEPSY-II) subtests and
   Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd edition (Bayley-3)
   items. In another between group evaluation, web-based and paper versions
   of the ASQ-2 were deemed generally equivalent. Digital Bayley-3
   inter-observer reliability ranged from 0.82 to 1.0. Examiner support,
   time, tool modifications, family resources, and comfort promotion
   supported digital administration. Conclusion: Digitally delivered ASQ-2,
   R-PDQ, Vineland, and Bayley-3 and NEPSY-II components show promise for
   equivalence with traditional administration.},

Title = {The Efficacy of Antiviral Treatment for Chronic Hepatitis B Patients
   with Normal ALT Levels: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis},
Journal = {HEPATITIS MONTHLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Context: When nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) were applied clinically to
   manage chronic hepatitis B virus infection, the prognosis of chronic
   hepatitis B (CHB) patients greatly improved. However, certain CHB
   patients with normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were not used
   to be considered as the population with the need for antiviral
   treatment.
   Objectives: This systematic review and meta-analysis collected and
   analyzed data from clinical trials to assess and compare the efficacy of
   antiviral treatment among patients with elevated and normal ALT levels.
   Methods: A systematic search was performed to gather studies published
   from 1990.01 to 2022.08 in PubMed and Web of Science databases. The
   quality of the literaturewasassessed, and16 studies were included for
   further analysis. Basic informationonincluded studies and study
   populations was collected. A meta-analysis was carried out to evaluate
   three major outcomes of viral response, hepatitis B envelope antigen
   (HBeAg) loss, and HBeAg seroconversion after NAs treatment based on data
   extracted from these studies. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence
   intervals (CIs) for all outcomes were calculated using fixed-effects
   models.
   Results: In the 16 relevant studies, 5,345 patients met the inclusion
   criteria, including 3,687 patients receiving NAs treatment. All patients
   were grouped into one with elevated ALT and another with normal ALT
   based on whether their pretreatment ALT levels > 1{*}upper limit of
   normal (ULN). For patients receiving lamivudine, the viral response
   showed no significant difference between the groups with elevated and
   normal ALT levels (pooled log OR: 0.51 {[}-0.23 - 1.26], P = 0.79); the
   pooled log OR for HBeAg loss was 1.19 (0.63 - 1.76, P = 0.03) and pooled
   log OR for HBeAg seroconversion was 2.19 (0.91 - 3.47, P = 0.40). For
   patients receiving first-line therapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
   (TDF) and entecavir (ETV), the viral response showed no significant
   difference between the two groups: Pooled log OR (0.38 {[}-0.22 - 0.97],
   P = 0.10). The pooled log OR for HBeAg loss and HBeAg seroconversion was
   (-0.07 {[}-0.81 0.67], P = 0.68) and (0.40 {[}-0.84 - 1.63], P = 0.88),
   respectively.
   Conclusions: The efficacies of first-line therapy with TDF and ETV
   treatments were similar in groups with elevated and normal ALT levels
   for the outcomes of viral response and HBeAg loss. These
   findingsmaysupport further treatment of CHBpatients with normal ALT
   levels.},

Title = {Recommendation mapping of the World Health Organization's guidelines on
   tuberculosis: A new approach to digitizing and presenting
   recommendations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {134},
Pages = {138-149},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objective: Having up-to-date health policy recommendations accessible in
   one location is in high demand by guideline users. We developed an easy
   to navigate interactive approach to organize recommendations and applied
   it to tuberculosis (TB) guidelines of the World Health Organization
   (WHO). Study Design: We used a mixed-methods
   study design to develop a framework for recommendation mapping with
   seven key methodological considerations. We define a recommendation map
   as an online repository of recommendations from several guidelines on a
   condition, providing links to the underlying evidence and expert
   judgments that inform them, allowing users to filter and cross tabulate
   the search results. We engaged guideline developers, users, and health
   software engineers in an iterative process to elaborate the WHO eTB
   recommendation map.
   Results: Applying the seven-step framework, we included 228
   recommendations, linked to 103 guideline questions and organized the
   recommendation map according to key components of the health question,
   including the original recommendations and rationale ( https://
   who.tuberculosis.recmap.org/ ).
   Conclusion: The recommendation mapping framework provides the entire
   continuum of evidence mapping by framing recommendations within a
   guideline questions' population, interventions, and comparators domains.
   Recommendation maps should allow guideline developers to organize their
   work meaningfully, standardize the automated publication of guidelines
   through links to the GRADEpro guideline development tool, and increase
   their accessibility and usability. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by

Volume = {2020},
Month = {OCT 29},
Abstract = {In this paper, the forest algorithm and the decision tree algorithm are
   mainly used to analyze students' physical education information, course
   exam results, and student learning data and relevant feature attributes
   from the online teaching platform. We aim to generate decision trees
   using the decision tree algorithm for the purpose of generating
   classification rules, based on which we can find factors that are
   important to students' physical education performance and form data
   basis for improving teaching quality to help teaching management and
   teachers improve teaching methods and adjust teaching strategies. We
   specifically achieved this objective by constructing a model for
   assessing the effectiveness of student teaching, the steps of which
   include data collection and preparation, data preprocessing (data
   cleaning, conversion, integration), model construction (algorithm
   training), and algorithm optimization, as well as realizing the
   simulation results of the model. At the same time, the importance of the
   relevant attributes of the model is analyzed, and some measures are
   proposed to improve the universities: the standard of physical education
   teaching and the corresponding strategies for improving teaching
   methods. The mainstream development environment is chosen to ensure the
   complete operation of the project system that integrates learning,
   operation, and evaluation. The sports virtual simulation experimental
   teaching system realized in this paper has good functionality,
   stability, and application benefits in operation and use.},

Abstract = {Background: computer-based screenings are usually used for early
   detection of a child's mental development problems. However, there are
   no such screenings in Russia yet. This study aimed to elaborate scales
   for rapid monitoring of mental development of 3-year-olds. Methods: 863
   children took part in the study, among them 814 children of the group
   Norm, 49 children with developmental delay (DD), including 23 children
   with symptoms of autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). The multifactor study
   of mental development tool was used as a part of a software complex for
   longitudinal research for data collection. This study used a set of 233
   tasks that were adequate for 3-year-olds. Exploratory and confirmatory
   factor analysis was used for the elaboration and factor validation of
   the scales. The structure of the relationship between scales and age was
   refined using structural equation modeling. Results: as a result of the
   research, screening scales were elaborated: ``Logical reasoning{''},
   ``Motor skills{''}, ``General awareness{''}, ``Executive functions{''}.
   The factor validity and reliability of scales were proved. The high
   discriminability of the scales in distinguishing the ``Norm{''} and
   ``DD{''} samples was revealed. The developed test norms take into
   account the child's age in days and allow identifying a ``risk group{''}
   with an expected forecast accuracy of at least 90\%. The obtained scales
   meet psychometric requirements for their application and allow creating
   an online screening system for wide application.},

Title = {Integrating the OHIF Viewer into XNAT: Achievements, Challenges and
   Prospects for Quantitative Imaging Studies},
Journal = {TOMOGRAPHY},

Abstract = {Purpose: XNAT is an informatics software platform to support imaging
   research, particularly in the context of large, multicentre studies of
   the type that are essential to validate quantitative imaging biomarkers.
   XNAT provides import, archiving, processing and secure distribution
   facilities for image and related study data. Until recently, however,
   modern data visualisation and annotation tools were lacking on the XNAT
   platform. We describe the background to, and implementation of, an
   integration of the Open Health Imaging Foundation (OHIF) Viewer into the
   XNAT environment. We explain the challenges overcome and discuss future
   prospects for quantitative imaging studies. Materials and methods: The
   OHIF Viewer adopts an approach based on the DICOM web protocol. To allow
   operation in an XNAT environment, a data-routing methodology was
   developed to overcome the mismatch between the DICOM and XNAT
   information models and a custom viewer panel created to allow navigation
   within the viewer between different XNAT projects, subjects and imaging
   sessions. Modifications to the development environment were made to
   allow developers to test new code more easily against a live XNAT
   instance. Major new developments focused on the creation and storage of
   regions-of-interest (ROIs) and included: ROI creation and editing tools
   for both contour- and mask-based regions; a ``smart CT{''} paintbrush
   tool; the integration of NVIDIA's Artificial Intelligence Assisted
   Annotation (AIAA); the ability to view surface meshes, fractional
   segmentation maps and image overlays; and a rapid image reader tool
   aimed at radiologists. We have incorporated the OHIF microscopy
   extension and, in parallel, introduced support for microscopy session
   types within XNAT for the first time. Results: Integration of the OHIF
   Viewer within XNAT has been highly successful and numerous additional
   and enhanced tools have been created in a programme started in 2017 that
   is still ongoing. The software has been downloaded more than 3700 times
   during the course of the development work reported here, demonstrating
   the impact of the work. Conclusions: The OHIF open-source,
   zero-footprint web viewer has been incorporated into the XNAT platform
   and is now used at many institutions worldwide. Further innovations are
   envisaged in the near future.},

Title = {Towards a fictional collective programming scenario: an approach based

Abstract = {In this paper, we base our research on a fictional collective
   programming scenario: A group of physically-distributed programmers try
   to collaboratively solve a programming problem in a web-based
   development environment, through a continually executing loop,
   consisting of three concurrent activities: exploration, integration, and
   feedback. Inexploration, a programmer is freely to submit a sequence of
   gradually improved solutions until achieving a correct one. All
   programmers' latest submissions are integrated into a collective
   artifact throughintegration. And throughfeedback, any programmer who
   hasn't achieved a correct solution is continuously pushed with
   personalized feedback information from the collective artifact, to help
   the programmer improve her/his submission. In order to facilitate the
   realization of this fictional scenario, we narrow the target problems to
   those introductory programming problems, design a genetic algorithm to
   integrate a set of syntax-correct programs into acollective program
   dependence graph(CPDG), and propose an automatic feedback generation
   method based on the CPDG and a programmer's latest submission. The key
   idea is to generate feedback from mutual inspiration: Any programmer's
   submission (even not correct) may possess information that could provide
   inspiration for others. We evaluate the proposed approach through a set
   of simulated experiments, as well as a set of real experiments. The
   results show that our approach has a precision of 90\% and a recall of
   80\% in randomly generated data sets on average, and a precision of 69\%
   and a recall of 77\% in real student submissions on average.},

Year = {2006},
Volume = {55},
Number = {5},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A meteorological data distribution system (MDDS) is presented. The
   system was implemented in the Spanish Juan Carlos I Antarctic station
   during the 2002-2003 campaign. Meteorological data are distributed to
   any point of the base using the LAN, which allows distributing data up
   to a 3.3-km radius from the acquisition point. The acquisition control
   procedures are also integrated in the same system. A wide range of
   difficulties have been overcome during the development of the MDDS,
   including the integration of heterogeneous components, the integrity of
   the message system, the future extension and scalability of the system,
   fault tolerance, process concurrency, and the temporary synchronization
   of all the applications involved. These have been achieved through three
   steps, namely 1) design of a complete object-oriented model of the
   system; 2) implementation of this model using a scalable and portable
   development environment, such as Java; and 3) use of an
   intercommunication application technology that fits all the system
   requirements (high level of abstraction and easy to program and to
   deploy) as the remote method invocation technology from Java. This
   development is part of a more ambitious project, called LabVir, that is
   devoted to implement distributed measurements in Spanish oceanographic
   vessels and in the Antarctic base using Web technology interfaces. In a
   more general framework, the LabVir project will make the experimentation
   tools accessible from any existing navigator, creating a distributed
   research environment, that is accessible and user friendly from any
   place with hypertext transfer protocol connectivity.},

Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Pages = {223-236},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In this paper, we focus on the design and building of iDNS-MS by using
   knowledge-based system and ontological engineering technologies.
   iDNS-MS, developed by using web interface and expert system technology,
   is a unifying environment for providing plausible answers to help solve
   the complex DNS management problems or alleviate these DNS
   administration loadings. In iDNS-MS, we propose an ontology-driven model
   to elicit rules from a previously built DNS ontology and construct an
   objected-oriented knowledge base. The whole process of the model
   consists of ontology construction, knowledge class organization and
   facts/rules loading phases. Ontology construction phase is used to
   construct the domain ontology, knowledge class organization phase is
   used to organize the relationships between the knowledge classes, and
   facts/rules loading phase is used to fill in the facts/rules of
   knowledge classes extracted from domain experts. In addition, we adopt
   DRAMA/NORM development environment as the expert system shell to design
   and implement a unifying framework (e.g. DNS-related problem diagnosis,
   planning, tutoring, etc.) for supporting intelligent DNS management.
   According to our experimental results, the paradigm of using DNS
   ontology to build iDNS-MS works good and effective. iDNS-MS will benefit
   the sharing and reusing of global DNS knowledge, the reduction of
   people's time to learn DNS management, the ease of DNS configuration and
   planning, and the improvement on DNS and network operation. (C) 2004

Title = {Insights in development and deployment of the GLA and NUTBAL decision
   support systems for grazinglands},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {74},
Number = {1},
Pages = {99-113},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The evolution of two decision support systems are traced from their
   roots in academia to deployment to technical advisors in USDA Natural
   Resource Conservation Service. The Grazing Lands Application (GLA)
   decision support system (DSS) was designed to provide forage inventories
   for grazing management of ranches. The other tool, NUTBAL, evolved as a
   stand alone DSS, emerging as a component of GLA when a supporting
   monitoring technology for nutritional profiling of free-ranging animals
   provided the user rapid estimates of diet quality from fecal scans with
   near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS). The adoption pattern of
   GLA and NUTBAL were quite different, with GLA experiencing less
   widespread adoption in USDA NRCS. The primary causes were (1) limited
   adoption rate of GLA within NRCS associated with changing culture in the
   information technology development group, (2) time overloading and staff
   reassignments for new programs, (3) changing software/hardware
   development environments imposed by the client disrupting development
   and System design and (4) large up front conversion of a largely
   paper-based system to a digital form. GLA was transformed to web-based
   delivery and streamlined to gain greater acceptance by users and ease
   time constraints on use of spatial tools. The NUTBAL system experienced
   more of a user driven evolution since it emerged from the GLA suite of
   tools and was supported by on-ranch monitoring systems capability of
   directly linking the livestock producer's animals with the software.
   NUTBAL's linkage to animal monitoring systems seems to have accelerated
   adoption rates. Ease of access to supporting input data coupled with
   early involvement of the target user and extensive analysis of the
   decision environment were critical to future success of these systems.
   Targeting technical advisors instead of livestock producers appears to
   be a more viable development track unless new innovations in DSS
   delivery systems can emerge using the internet. (C) 2002 Published by

Abstract = {Background: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients who had exposed to
   lamivudine (LAM) and telbivudine (LdT) had high risk of developing
   entecavir (ETV)-resistance after long-term treatment. We aimed to
   conduct a systematic review and a network meta-analysis on the efficacy
   and cost-effectiveness on antiviral regimens in CHB patients with
   ETV-resistance.
   Data sources: We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science for studies
   on nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) treatment {[}including tenofovir
   disoproxil fumarate (TDF)-based rescue therapies, adefovir (ADV)based
   rescue therapies and double-dose ETV therapy] in CHB patients with
   ETV-resistance. The network meta-analysis was conducted for 1-year
   complete virological response (CVR) and biological response (BR) rates
   using GeMTC and ADDIS. A cost-effective analysis was conducted to select
   an economic and effective treatment regimen based on the 1-year CVR
   rate.
   Results: A total of 6 studies were finally included in this analysis.
   The antiviral efficacy was estimated. On network meta-analysis, the
   1-year CVR rate in ETV-TDF {[}odds ratio (OR) = 22.30; 95\% confidence
   interval (CI): 2.78-241.93], LAM-TDF (OR = 70.67; 95\% CI: 5.16-1307.45)
   and TDF (OR = 16.90; 95\% CI: 2.28-186.30) groups were significantly
   higher than that in the ETV double-dose group; the 1-year CVR rate in
   the LAM-TDF group (OR = 14.82; 95\% CI: 1.03-220.31) was significantly
   higher than that in the LAM/LdT-ADV group. The 1-year BR rate of ETV-TDF
   (OR = 28.68; 95\% CI: 1.70-1505.08) and TDF (OR = 21.79; 95\% CI:
   1.43-1070.09) therapies were significantly higher than that of ETV
   double-dose therapy. TDFbased therapies had the highest possibility to
   achieve the CVR and BR at 1 year, in which LAM-TDF combined therapy was
   the most effective regimen. The ratio of cost/effectiveness for 1-year
   treatment was 8 526, 17 649, 20 651 Yuan in the TDF group, TDF-ETV
   group, and ETV-ADV group, respectively.
   Conclusions: TDF-based combined therapies such as ETV-TDF and LAM-TDF
   therapies were the first-line treatment if financial condition is
   allowed. (C) 2020 First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School

Abstract = {Apparatus theory (a hybrid of McLuhan and Derrida) hypothesizes that a
   civiliza-tion of electracy (the digital apparatus) must learn how to
   thrive in a lifeworld in which the visceral faculty of appetite is
   hegemonic. The dominant axis of behavior today is fantasy -anxi-ety
   (attraction/repulsion). We propose that world theming has created a
   vernacular discourse that may be raised to a second power of expression
   as vehicle of visceral intelligence. The immediate claim is that theming
   in digital media augments mood (ambiance) into a power of imagination,
   just as dialectic in writing augmented logic into a power of reason.
   Fantasy today is persuasive, just as logical entailment is (was) in the
   rational order of literacy. Decisions de-termining real events today are
   being made in worlds of mood.World theming is evident in the vernacular
   art practices arising from recent advanc-es in artificial intelligence.
   The availability of commodity GPUs, along with public access to advanced
   research via GitHub, Kaggle, Hugging Face, and the proliferation of
   forums such as Reddit, Discord, YouTube, and others, has resulted in a
   renaissance of public engagement with technology-informed creative
   practice. In addition, the general availability of Google's previously
   internal-only development tool, Colab, in late 2017 provided access to
   cloud-based GPUs and storage systems accessible only to data scientists
   and academics. In early 2021 Ryan Murdock released a Colab notebook
   called Big Sleep that combined Ope-nAI's recently published Contrastive
   Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) with BigGAN. This model is a
   paradigmatic example of our observation. By early 2022, multiple
   derivations of this process incorporated alternative image generation
   techniques. This paper will demonstrate how the fundamental basis of
   these methods are distinctly electrate in their use of `theme' and
   emphasis on `mood' in world-building, including a case-study animation
   called Dissipative Off-ramps.},

Title = {Development and Application of a Chinese Webpage Suicide Information
   Mining System (Sims)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {38},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Objectives This study aims at designing and piloting a convenient
   Chinese webpage suicide information mining system (SIMS) to help search
   and filter required data from the internet and discover potential
   features and trends of suicide.
   Methods SIMS utilizes Microsoft Visual Studio2008, SQL2008 and C\# as
   development tools. It collects webpage data via popular search engines;
   cleans the data using trained models plus minimum manual help;
   translates the cleaned texts into quantitative data through models and
   supervised fuzzy recognition; analyzes and visualizes related variables
   by self-programmed algorithms.
   Results The SIMS developed comprises such functions as suicide news and
   blogs collection, data filtering, cleaning, extraction and translation,
   data analysis and presentation. SIMS-mediated mining of one-year webpage
   revealed that: peak months and hours of web-reported suicide events were
   June-July and 10-11 am respectively, and the lowest months and hours,
   September-October and 1-7 am; suicide reports came mostly from Soho,
   Tecent, Sina etc.; male suicide victims over counted female victims in
   most sub-regions but southwest China; homes, public places and rented
   houses were the top three places to commit suicide; poisoning, cutting
   vein and jumping from building were the most commonly used methods to
   commit suicide; love disputes, family disputes and mental diseases were
   the leading causes.
   Conclusions SIMS provides a preliminary and supplementary means for
   monitoring and understanding suicide. It proposes useful aspects as well
   as tools for analyzing the features and trends of suicide using data
   derived from Chinese webpages. Yet given the intrinsic ``dual nature{''}
   of internet-based suicide information and the tremendous difficulties
   experienced by ourselves and other researchers, there is still a long
   way to go for us to expand, refine and evaluate the system.},

   Literature Review},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {61905-61921},
Abstract = {Education is a vital part of the development of society and it is
   changing over time in terms of methods, content, concepts, and models.
   Recently, it has been increasingly prevalent to benefit from the
   potentialities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in addressing educational
   issues. In this research, the current state of the art of the
   integration of AI in K-12 education was provided. Specifically,
   different parts of education in which AI was employed along with the
   related AI categories were discussed according to different K-12 grades
   and courses. Additionally, technologies and environments that
   contributed to employing AI in education were discussed. To this end, a
   systematic literature review was conducted on articles and conference
   papers published between 2011 and 2021 in the Web of Science and Scopus
   databases. As the result of the initial search, 2075 documents were
   extracted and based on inclusive criteria and 210 documents were
   identified for further investigation. AI applications were categorized
   into Student performance, Teaching, Selection, and Behavior tasks, and
   Other. Machine Learning (ML) and Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) were
   the most common approaches among AI categories. Furthermore, high
   school-related applications were more frequent and STEM courses were
   substantially targeted by AI. In conclusion, the remarkable impact of AI
   on education was concluded. The current study reveals information about
   the potentialities offered by AI in K-12 education which aids
   researchers in implementing AI-based education systems. As for future
   works, other databases such as ACM library and Google Scholar can be
   investigated as well. Furthermore, exploring the 95 papers that were
   excluded due to inaccessibility to their full texts can be taken into
   account. Finally, the papers can be also investigated in terms of
   pedagogical approaches or development tools.},

Abstract = {Ensuring model quality is a key success factor in many computer science
   areas, and becomes crucial in recent software engineering paradigms like
   the one proposed by model-driven software development. Tool support for
   measurements and redesigns becomes essential to help developers improve
   the quality of their models. However, developing such helper tools for
   the wide variety of (frequently domain specific) visual notations used
   by software engineers is a hard and repetitive task that does not take
   advantage from previous developments, thus being frequently forgotten.
   In this paper we present our approach for the visual specification of
   measurements and redesigns for Domain Specific Visual Languages (DSVLs).
   With this purpose, we introduce a novel DSVL called SLAMMER that
   contains generalisations of some of the more used types of internal
   product measurements and redesigns. The goal is to facilitate the task
   of defining measurements and redesigns for any DSVL, as well as the
   generation of tools from such specification reducing or eliminating the
   necessity of coding. We rely on the use of visual patterns for the
   specification of the relevant elements for each measurement and redesign
   type. In addition, SLAMMER allows the specification of redesigns either
   procedurally or by means of graph transformation rules. These redesigns
   can be triggered when the measurements reach a certain threshold.
   These concepts have been implemented in the meta-model ling tool
   AToM(3). In this way, when a DSVL is designed, it is possible to specify
   measurements and redesigns that will become available in the final
   modelling environment generated for the language. As an example, we show
   a case study in the web modelling domain. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Prevalence and risk factors for road traffic injuries and mortalities in

Journal = {INJURY PREVENTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {384-394},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background Road traffic injuries, which are responsible for premature
   deaths and functional losses, are the leading causes of unintentional
   injuries in Ethiopia. As most studies on road traffic injuries, so far,
   have been either local or regional, it is believed that combining the
   regional or local data to get nationally representative information
   could help programme implementers in setting priorities. Objective The
   aim of this review was to estimate the proportion of road traffic
   injuries, mortality and risk factors for the problem among all age
   groups in Ethiopia. Data sources A systematic review of articles using
   MEDLINE/PubMed SCOPUS Web of Science and science direct was conducted.
   Additional studies were identified via manual search. Study selection
   Only studies that reported road traffic injuries and/or mortalities for
   all age groups were included in this review. Data synthesis All pooled
   analyses were based on random-effect models. Twenty-six studies for the
   prevalence of RTIs (n=37 424), 24 studies for road traffic injuries
   (RTI) mortality, (n=38 888), 9 studies for prevalence of fracture among
   RTIs (n=2817) and 5 studies for the prevalence of post-traumatic stress
   disorder (n=1733) met our inclusion criteria. Driving in the dark
   increased severity of injury by 1.77, 95\% CI 1.60 to 1.95). The
   certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADEpro Guideline
   Development Tool. Conclusion In this review, the burden of road traffic
   injuries and mortalities remains high in Ethiopia. Human factors are the
   most common causes of the problem in Ethiopia. The existing safety
   regulations should be re-evaluated and supported by continuous
   behavioural interventions. PROSPERO registration number CRD42019124406.},

Abstract = {The goal of this study was to examine the utilization and perceived
   effectiveness of the International Association of Medical Science
   Educators (IAMSE) Webcast Audio Seminar Series (WAS) by participants at
   the individual and institutional levels. The Webcast Audio Seminar
   Series User Survey (WASUS) included multiple quantitative and
   qualitative measures of user perceptions of their experiences and
   overall quality. Data was collected using a 42-item survey that examined
   user identification, utilization, and perceived effectiveness of the
   IAMSE WAS as a faculty development tool. Quantitative measures were
   summarized using descriptive statistics, including frequencies, means,
   and standard deviations. Qualitative data was investigated using an
   iterative, inductive thematic coding method. Qualitative themes were
   summarized and applied to quantitative trends as explanatory mechanisms
   with the intent to provide a more nuanced narrative of the data. The
   survey was sent to all 2012-2017 WAS participants which provided a
   cross-sectional snapshot of WAS user perceptions over a substantial
   period of time. Fifty-two participants responded. Survey participants
   were asked to rate WAS sessions on twelve different quality components.
   Quality ratings were explored by user subscription types and user
   experiences with other web-based conferences. Users rated the WAS
   program very highly on all components from 2012 to 2017. The high level
   of perceived quality by users is likely an important reason why WAS
   participation has continued to grow since its implementation. Since the
   quality ratings were consistently high over a 5-year period in which the
   number of users also grew and organizers continue to add new interactive
   features for users, it is expected that this growth is sustainable.},

Title = {Is soy intake related to age at onset of menarche? A cross-sectional
   study among adolescents with a wide range of soy food consumption},
Journal = {NUTRITION JOURNAL},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUN 3},
Abstract = {Background: Early onset of menarche may negatively influence the future
   health of adolescent girls. Several factors affect the timing of
   menarche but it is not clear if soy foods consumption around pubertal
   years plays a role; thus, we examined its relation to age at onset of
   menarche (AOM) in a high soy-consuming population.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 339 girls ages 12-18
   years attending middle and high schools near two Seventh-day Adventist
   universities in California and Michigan using a web-based dietary
   questionnaire and physical development tool. Soy consumption
   (categorized as total soy, meat alternatives, tofu/traditional soy, and
   soy beverages) was estimated from the questionnaire, while AOM was
   self-reported. Data analyses included descriptive statistics, Cox
   proportional hazards ratios, Kaplan-Meier curves and Poisson regression
   with adjustment for relevant confounders.
   Results: Mean (SD) intakes were: total soy, 12.9 (14.4) servings/week;
   meat alternatives, 7.0 (8.9) servings/week; tofu/traditional soy foods,
   2.1 (3.8) servings/week; soy beverages, 3.8 (6.3) servings/week. Mean
   AOM was 12.5 (1.4) y for those who reached menarche. Consumption of
   total soy and the 3 types of soy foods was not significantly associated
   with AOM and with the odds for early- or late-AOM. Adjustment for
   demographic and dietary factors did not change the results.
   Conclusion: Soy intake is not associated with AOM in a population of
   adolescent girls who have a wide range of, and relatively higher, soy
   intake than the general US population. Our finding suggests that the
   increasing popularity of soy in the US may not be associated with AOM.},

Abstract = {This study examined the difference in dog owning between Japan and the
   United States, and the effect of these differences on dogs' behavioral
   characteristics. Behavioral evaluations of privately-owned dogs were
   obtained by using online questionnaire. We compared background and
   demographic information from the two countries and analyzed the effects
   of these differences on behavioral characteristics in dogs. The results
   indicated that there was a bias in the dog breeds kept in Japan compared
   to the United States and that Japanese dogs' body weight was lower than
   the US dogs. The main source of dog acquisition was pet stores in Japan
   and breeders and/or shelters in the United States. Multiple linear
   regression analysis found that Japanese dogs showed more aggression to
   household members and higher energy, restlessness and fear of non-social
   stimuli than US dogs, while US dogs showed more fear of unfamiliar
   persons, separation-related behavior and excitability. US dogs also
   showed higher levels of trainability and attachment to owners. The lower
   dog's body weight was, the higher the behavioral scores except for
   trainability were. When dogs that were obtained under 3 months of age
   were analyzed, the younger the dogs were when their owners obtained
   them, the higher the scores on some behavioral problem factors were. The
   higher rates of problem behaviors among Japanese dogs compared with US
   dogs suggest that the preference for small breed dogs and poor early
   development environment influenced the behavioral characteristics of
   dogs.},

Title = {Eye tracking technologies to visualize secure coding behavior},
Journal = {ARRAY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Secure coders' experiences and performances vary greatly and any missed
   security flaws in source code may lead to costly consequences. Their
   behavior to analyze source code and develop mitigation techniques is not
   well understood. Our objective is to gain insight into the strategies
   and techniques from both novice and experienced developers. Proper
   understanding can help us to inform inexperienced coders to efficiently
   and accurately approach, discover, and mitigate security flaws. Our
   research relies upon eye tracking hardware and software to collect and
   analyze the eye gazes. Unlike existing approaches, we incorporate a wide
   range of tasks simultaneously reading documentation, writing code, and
   using security coding analysis tools. We analyze both static and dynamic
   (interactive) stimuli in a realistic software development environment.
   Our pictorial visualizations represent a coder's eye gazes that visually
   demonstrates their behavior and patterns. In addition, we provide the
   full context of the stimuli that a participant observed. This allows for
   investigating the behavior at a range of tasks for a single participant
   and between participants. Our secure coding tasks include reading
   documentation, reading source code, and writing source code for a web
   application as well as utilizing security code scanning tools. Our
   contributions also include (1) novel visualization techniques to present
   transitions among components within and between applications, and (2)
   presentations of coders' attention levels during secure coding by
   investigating the change of pupil sizes. The eye tracking collection and
   analysis techniques support both modifiable stimuli and stimuli
   presented in different sequences based upon individual participant's
   behavior.},

Title = {Links between environmental features and developmental outcomes of elite
   youth athletes: A cross-sectional study within the German talent pathway},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY OF SPORT AND EXERCISE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {71},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {From a holistic perspective, the talent development environment (TDE)
   influences not only the athletic development but also the development of
   personal skills as well as the wellbeing of elite youth athletes.
   Alongside research on the effects of broader environmental features on
   athlete-related talent development (TD) outcomes, the importance of the
   closer social climate (i.e., teammates, coaches, support staff) is also
   emphasized. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the
   relationship between environmental features, the social climate and
   athlete-related TD outcomes (I). Additionally, an exploratory analysis
   was conducted to investigate the role of motivational climate and
   psychological safety in the relationship between environmental features
   and athleterelated TD outcomes (II). To this end, 345 German elite youth
   athletes completed an online survey assessing their perceptions of
   environmental features, coach-created motivational climate, and
   psychological safety as well as wellbeing, performance satisfaction, and
   life skills development. The results revealed that environmental
   features (especially long-term development focus, effective
   coach-athlete communication, and the social network), motivational
   climate and psychological safety were all significantly associated with
   the outcome variables. These findings underline the significance of
   environmental features for athlete-related TD outcomes of young talented
   athletes in German elite youth sports. However, the results indicated
   that motivational climate and psychological safety did not have
   significant indirect effects on the relationship between TDE features
   and athlete-related TD outcomes. Thus, it remains to be questioned if
   and what other processes influence this relationship.},

   technology of BMS. High precision of SOC estimation can not only
   increase service life of battery, but also enhance energy utilization
   efficiency and cut down the operational cost. Based on fully understand
   working principle of battery, three-order RC equivalent circuit is chose
   to simulate the external characteristics. Introduce the working theory
   of that combination of extended Kalman filter (EKF) and open circuit
   voltage (OCV), and the whole recursive algorithm of estimation SOC,
   using the OCV-SOC look-up table to solve the problem of initial value of
   SOC to a certain degree. The hardware circuit and software of BMS are
   designed. Hardware circuit consists of current measurement circuit,
   voltage measurement circuit, temperature measurement circuit and
   equalization circuit. The software is designed by C as the development
   language, the Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 as development environment
   and SQL Server 2008 as database management system. The experiments are
   carried out after the experimental platform of system hardware and
   software is constructed. The system realizes the real-time online

Title = {Scalable Multimedia Content Analysis on Parallel Platforms Using Python},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA COMPUTING COMMUNICATIONS AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this new era dominated by consumer-produced media there is a high
   demand for web-scalable solutions to multimedia content analysis. A
   compelling approach to making applications scalable is to explicitly map
   their computation onto parallel platforms. However, developing efficient
   parallel implementations and fully utilizing the available resources
   remains a challenge due to the increased code complexity, limited
   portability and required low-level knowledge of the underlying hardware.
   In this article, we present PyCASP, a Python-based framework that
   automatically maps computation onto parallel platforms from Python
   application code to a variety of parallel platforms. PyCASP is designed
   using a systematic, pattern-oriented approach to offer a single software
   development environment for multimedia content analysis applications.
   Using PyCASP, applications can be prototyped in a couple hundred lines
   of Python code and automatically scale to modern parallel processors.
   Applications written with PyCASP are portable to a variety of parallel
   platforms and efficiently scale from a single desktop Graphics
   Processing Unit (GPU) to an entire cluster with a small change to
   application code. To illustrate our approach, we present three
   multimedia content analysis applications that use our framework: a
   state-of-the-art speaker diarization application, a content-based music
   recommendation system based on the Million Song Dataset, and a video
   event detection system for consumer-produced videos. We show that across
   this wide range of applications, our approach achieves the goal of
   automatic portability and scalability while at the same time allowing
   easy prototyping in a high-level language and efficient performance of
   low-level optimized code.},

Abstract = {Motivating individuals in today's world is an essential responsibility
   that falls on the shoulders of educators. Encouraging students to
   participate in various activities beyond just their studies is
   essential. This will help motivate them and keep them engaged. The study
   aims to develop a system of rewards and motivation for students using
   virtual currency and its implementation in the educational process of
   Zhytomyr Polytechnic State University. The developed system promotes
   additional external motivation for learning, scientific and creative
   activities. The article discusses the main stages of creating a mobile
   application. The Ionic Framework is the basis of the application's
   architecture, utilizing Angular as its foundation. Ionic Framework 5 was
   used to write the client part. The application development environment
   is JetBrains WebStorm on JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Firebase handles the
   server aspect of the application. The application uses the Firebase
   Google Cloud Firestore database with the Angular Fire project framework
   connected. The article describes the system design process using UML
   diagrams. The software product's scenarios, general structure, and
   database description (which includes 16 tables) are provided. We have
   ensured that our features are developed with utmost priority given to
   the security of user data and real-time access to information. This
   allows to provide access only to relevant information without prior
   updating of the client part of the application. This article explains
   how to install and use the system on an Android operating system. It
   also covers the design of the application interface and provides a
   demonstration of how the system works. The system's primary objective is
   to encourage users by granting them the power to handpick a task from
   their preferred category, successfully accomplish it, and ultimately
   earn virtual funds. These virtual funds can be converted into desirable
   items in a virtual store.},

Abstract = {Background: Participation in heart surgery requires procedural and
   factual knowledge and intensive preparation. There is evidence in the
   literature that multimedia driven learning has advantages in medical
   fields where an understanding of complex temporal and spatial events
   plays an important role. This work describes the development and
   evaluation of a multimedia driven, online teaching course on aortic
   valve replacement for students and residents. Methods: The instructional
   model followed a methodological approach with scalable information for
   different user groups. Various interactive multimedia development tools
   were employed. In a prospective study, 20 students and 10 residents were
   exposed to the program in a standardized environment. Both groups
   completed a 20-item multiple choice pre- and post-test. Psychometric
   evaluation with HILVE (Heidelberg inventory for the evaluation of
   teaching courses, 50 items) was performed. Results: The multimedia
   course integrates more than 200 high quality surgical video and audio
   sequences, inter-active 2 D and 3 D models, as well as illustrations and
   text. It is available at www.lamedica.de. Study time in the student
   group was 103 +/- 11 min and 70 +/- 10 min in the resident group. Mean
   number of correct responses to the knowledge pre-test was 6.23 +/- 2.71
   in the student group and 12.2 +/- 2.66 in the resident group. Mean
   number of correct responses to the knowledge post-test was 15.24 +/-
   2.06 in the student group (p < 0.0001 vs. pre-test) and 17 +/- 2.98 in
   the resident group (p = 0.004 vs. pretest). The HILVE test showed
   positive results for teaching conditions, the program's instructional
   competence, student motivation and individual learning. Conclusion: Our
   data demonstrate that multimedia driven training can adapt to the
   individual needs of learners and improves procedural knowledge required
   for open heart surgery. Consequently, the whole course forms part of the
   training of residents and students.},

Title = {Churn prediction of mobile and online casual games using play log data},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 5},
Abstract = {Internet-connected devices, especially mobile devices such as
   smartphones, have become widely accessible in the past decade.
   Interaction with such devices has evolved into frequent and
   short-duration usage, and this phenomenon has resulted in a pervasive
   popularity of casual games in the game sector. On the other hand,
   development of casual games has become easier than ever as a result of
   the advancement of development tools. With the resulting fierce
   competition, now both acquisition and retention of users are the prime
   concerns in the field. In this study, we focus on churn prediction of
   mobile and online casual games. While churn prediction and analysis can
   provide important insights and action cues on retention, its application
   using play log data has been primitive or very limited in the casual
   game area. Most of the existing methods cannot be applied to casual
   games because casual game players tend to churn very quickly and they do
   not pay periodic subscription fees. Therefore, we focus on the new
   players and formally define churn using observation period (OP) and
   churn prediction period (CP). Using the definition, we develop a
   standard churn analysis process for casual games. We cover essential
   topics such as preprocessing of raw data, feature engineering including
   feature analysis, churn prediction modeling using traditional machine
   learning algorithms (logistic regression, gradient boosting, and random
   forests) and two deep learning algorithms (CNN and LSTM), and
   sensitivity analysis for OP and CP. Play log data of three different
   casual games are considered by analyzing a total of 193,443 unique
   player records and 10,874,958 play log records. While the analysis
   results provide useful insights, the overall results indicate that a
   small number of well-chosen features used as performance metrics might
   be sufficient for making important action decisions and that OP and CP
   should be properly chosen depending on the analysis goal.},

Abstract = {The effectiveness of additional usage of adjuvants for bowel preparation
   is still unclear. This study compared 1L polyethylene glycol plus
   ascorbic acid with adjuvant drug regimens (1L PEG-AA, lower volume) with
   2L polyethylene glycol plus ascorbic acid (2L PEG-A, low volume) to
   evaluate whether the adjuvants can be used to reduce the standard dosage
   of purgative further. The PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and
   Web of Science database were searched for randomized controlled trials
   (RCTs). The primary outcome was the efficacy of bowel preparation, and
   the secondary outcomes were patients' tolerability and complication
   rate. The overall quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADEpro
   guideline development tool. Five RCTs with a total of 1013 patients from
   Korea were included. The majority of patients were outpatients from
   different hospitals. The pooled data showed no significant difference in
   the adequate bowel preparation rate (89.3\% versus 89.4\%, RR 1, 95\% CI
   0.95-1.05, I-2=47\%) as well as in the complication rate (RR for nausea
   1.22, 95\% CI 0.89-1.65, I-2=49\%; RR for bloating 0.96, 95\% CI
   0.73-1.28, I-2=0\%; RR for vomiting 0.69, 95\% CI 0.32-1.50, I-2=33\%;
   RR for abdominal pain 1.01, 95\% CI 0.61-1.69, I-2=0\%). But a
   significantly higher willingness rate was observed in the lower volume
   (85.1\% versus 67.9\%, RR 1.25, 95\% CI 1.14-1.38, I-2=46\%). The
   quality of primary outcome evidence was moderate. The findings of this
   meta-analysis revealed that 1L PEG-AA may be a viable alternative to 2L
   PEG-A, with comparable effectiveness, better patient preference, and no

Title = {Bibliometric Mapping of Research on Magic Towns of Mexico},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The tourism program ``Pueblos Magicos{''} was created in 2001 by the
   Mexican Secretary of Tourism (Sectur), together with its brand, with the
   aim of promoting tourism by preserving secular and ancestral traditions,
   as well as revitalizing cities and towns that make great efforts to
   protect and safeguard their cultural wealth. In this context, the aim of
   this research work is to show the current state of scientific research
   carried out within the context of the Magic Towns of Mexico. The work
   methodology is based on the bibliometric analysis of the scientific
   production indexed in two main international databases: Web of Science
   and Scopus. The application of this technique will make it possible to
   obtain a scientific mapping of the production (growth, researchers in
   the subject, production impact through the number of citations, network
   analysis, etc.), with the aim of observing the evolution in the
   generation of knowledge regarding this tourism development tool that
   acts as a distinctive brand for tourism in Mexico. This mapping is
   useful for researchers as it provides information on the research
   carried out so far, allowing them to identify gaps to work on in their
   future research work. The systematic search process identified 52
   articles. The results indicate that the research carried out in this
   context is incipient, with few researchers addressing the subject on a
   continuous basis and most of them being transient researchers with a
   single article. Most of the research was approached from the perspective
   of cultural heritage, cultural resources, inherited resources, cultural
   tourism, public policy, local development and sustainable tourism, and
   sustainable development. In light of the number of articles published,
   all of these can be considered to be incipient lines of research.},

Title = {CIDA - THE EXPERT COMPANY INFORMATION DATABASE ADVISER},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Pages = {247-259},
Abstract = {The development ana testing of an expert system to assist with the
   selection of online business databases for UK company information is
   described. The Company Information Database Adviser (CIDA) was designed
   for novice and end-user searchers and covers seven categories of company
   information: factual (directory) details, financial data, company news,
   company structure, mergers and acquisitions (M \& A) activity, market
   information and company profiles. The development tool was the Leonardo
   expert system shell.
   Knowledge acquisition included three knowledge elicitation sessions with
   each of four experienced business information intermediaries. Outputs of
   knowledge acquisition were: (i) factual and evaluative information for
   over 200 database/host combinations, and (ii) rules, expressed
   diagrammatically, for database selection within each category of company
   information. These were used to build a prototype which was examined by
   intermediaries and further refined. The design is outlined and the rules
   governing the selection of company directory databases are described by
   way of illustration. Testing included: an evaluation of the user
   interface by novice users; field testing by staff and end-users at a
   prominent business school, and comparative performance trials against
   conventional database directories. CIDA's database recommendations were
   in close agreement with those of business intermediaries across a range
   of independently generated queries. It was used far more successfully
   than conventional business database directories by trainee searchers
   (library and information students). End-user field trials were
   disappointing because of lack of participation. The study concludes that
   expertise in business database selection can successfully be distilled
   into a number of rules which can be applied by an expert system, but
   more research is needed into how databases are selected and used.},

Abstract = {Inhomogeneities in production-scale bioreactors influence microbial
   growth and product quality due to insufficient mixing and mass transfer.
   For this reason, lots of efforts are being made to investigate the
   effects of gradients that impose stress in large-scale reactors in
   laboratory scale. We have implemented a scale-down model which allows
   separating a homogeneous part, a stirred tank reactor (STR), and a plug
   flow reactor (PFR) which mimics the inhomogeneous regimes of the
   large-scale fermenters. This scale-down model shows solutions to trigger
   oxygen limited conditions in the PFR part of the scale-down setup for
   physiological analysis. The goal of the study was to investigate the
   scale-up relevant physiological responses of Pichia pastoris strain to
   oxygen limited process conditions in the above mentioned two-compartment
   bioreactor setup. Experimental results with non-induced cultures show
   that the specific growth rate significantly decreased with increasing
   the exposure time to oxygen limitation. In parallel more by-products
   were produced. Examining physiological scalable key parameters,
   multivariate data analyses solely using on-line data revealed that
   different exposures to the oxygen limitation significantly affected the
   culture performance. This work with the small scale-downs setup reflects
   new approaches for a valuable process development tool for accelerating
   strain characterization or for verifying CFD simulations of large-scale
   bioreactors. As a novel methodological achievement, the combination of
   the two-compartment scale-down system with the proposed multivariate
   techniques of solely using online data is a valuable tool for
   recognition of stress effects on the culture performance for
   physiological bioprocess scale-up issues. (C) 2013, The Society for

Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {39},

Abstract = {In this study, we present a computer package to implement fuzzy expert
   systems using Java. The purpose of this study is to provide an
   easy-to-understand and easy-to-implement computer package for those
   people who want to develop their own customized Java-based fuzzy expert
   applications without using existing end-user fuzzy expert software. The
   code size of the proposed package is less than 300 code lines where some
   existing Java classes developed by Sun Microsystems, Inc., are utilized
   to handle necessary geometrical manipulations. We demonstrate the ideas
   of how we implement fuzzy expert systems with the existing Java classes
   by providing code fragments. To validate the proposed package, we first
   developed a console application to compare the results of using the
   proposed package with those of using an existing commercial fuzzy expert
   software package, Fuzzy Inference Development Environment (FIDE). The
   proposed package is well-modularized in software modules with high
   maintainability and customizability. To validate this, we developed
   three additional applications with the proposed package including a
   window-based application and two web-based applications: JSP Model 1 and
   JSP Model 2 (MVC design pattern). Through the developments of these
   applications, we find that it is extremely simple and straightforward to
   build customized fuzzy expert applications with the code fragments
   provided in this study, saving a lot of programming works. In additions,
   the proposed package has good extensibilities to establish piecewise
   linear membership functions and to approximate non-linear membership
   functions. Meanwhile, UML is also utilized to describe the structures
   and behaviors of the proposed package. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {JOURNAL OF UNIVERSITY TEACHING AND LEARNING PRACTICE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Academic librarians cannot escape the implications of the knowledge
   economy and the pervasion of technology which effects everything that we
   do. Similarly, we must be prepared to teach our students how to cope in
   this knowledge society and how to develop the necessary information and
   digital literacy skills to be productive members of society in a digital
   environment. This article explores the first eighteen months of our
   experience as digital curriculum librarians in a large project at the
   University of South Australia (UniSA), UniSA Online. We have taken this
   opportunity to critically reflect on being embedded librarians within
   such a strategic and unique project. We examine the key cultural,
   pedagogical and technological challenges we have faced in delivering
   resources, support and services to the project team. The solutions we
   have adopted to overcome these challenges within an intensive course
   development environment are also outlined. The importance of building
   good relationships both within the project team, academics and with
   other library staff to deliver positive outcomes is discussed. We
   examine the pedagogical imperatives we have followed and the
   technological challenges we have faced to provide an active learning
   experience for our students in a digital learning environment. Our role
   as digital curriculum librarians is still evolving, however, we can
   observe some emerging trends within academic librarianship and comment
   on them, as we believe that the imperatives of the knowledge society
   will only become more prevalent into the future. We conclude by
   outlining which professional skills we need as academic librarians to
   evolve our roles and be successful in the digital world.},

Title = {Dynamically Identifying and Evaluating Key Barriers to Promoting
   Prefabricated Buildings: Text Mining Approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {149},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Prefabricated buildings (PBs) have been widely perceived as
   environmentally friendly buildings and advocated globally. In many
   countries, the promotion rate of PBs remains slow, hindered by various
   barriers. With the change of external development environment under
   different periods, there is also the temporal dynamic evolution in
   barriers. Many studies have adopted some traditional methods to explore
   these barriers, but only focused on the research-conducting periods and
   ignored the changes of obstacles in different periods, which is the
   so-called dynamic nature of barriers. This would lead to the
   noncorrespondence between the previously studied barriers and the new
   situation of different periods. In this regard, this study aims to
   explore barriers dynamically and efficiently. Taking the online
   discussions of Chinese construction practitioners (CPs) as the sample,
   text mining techniques were performed to identify the barriers at
   different stages in the period from 2016 to 2021. Then, with a proposed
   sentiment scoring model, CPs' sentiment and attention level were
   combined to indirectly evaluate the impact degree of the corresponding
   barriers. In the end, the findings were verified in semistructured
   interviews. As a result, the changeable sentiments of CPs were tracked
   in the timeline, the evolution of key barriers at different stages and
   the internal driving force were revealed, and some new findings of
   barriers were identified. This paper not only makes a great theoretical
   contribution for PB studies, but also provides a research framework
   worthy of reference for researchers or government to regularly explore
   problems in the PB industry or other industries.},

   development environment of many industries are gradually changing and
   developing towards networking, the combination of online and offline has
   become the mainstream, but the development of the Internet is
   accompanied by hidden dangers of personal information security,
   especially for the financial industry, industry has become a very
   prominent user experience problem in the Internet finance industry. With
   the prosperity of Internet finance, many enterprises attach importance
   to the construction of Internet Finance websites, and improve the trust
   and experience of users through the design of websites. This paper
   analyzes the user trust experience and trust mechanism in Internet
   financial websites; Through the analysis of different user groups to
   compare the degree of trust in Internet Finance websites, compare the
   level of trust and coupling between traditional finance and Internet
   Finance in the hearts of users; Through the research, it is found that
   most white-collar social workers have high trust in Internet financial
   websites, and the elderly group has the lowest trust; In contrast to
   traditional finance, we can effectively improve the function-ality and
   value of financial products in the Internet Finance website, drive the
   emotional identity of users, and attract users visually from the website
   design, establishing and maintaining users' trust in Internet finance
   industry websites can greatly enhance users' trust in Internet finance;
   It expands the scope of financial services and simplifies service

Title = {A visual interactive analytic tool for filtering and summarizing large

Journal = {BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {FEB 14},
Abstract = {Vast volumes of data, coded through hierarchical terminologies (e.g.,
   International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision-Clinical
   Modification {[}ICD10-CM], Medical Subject Headings {[}MeSH]), are
   generated routinely in electronic health record systems and medical
   literature databases. Although graphic representations can help to
   augment human understanding of such data sets, a graph with hundreds or
   thousands of nodes challenges human comprehension. To improve
   comprehension, new tools are needed to extract the overviews of such
   data sets. We aim to develop a visual interactive analytic tool for
   filtering and summarizing large health data sets coded with hierarchical
   terminologies (VIADS) as an online, and publicly accessible tool. The
   ultimate goals are to filter, summarize the health data sets, extract
   insights, compare and highlight the differences between various health
   data sets by using VIADS. The results generated from VIADS can be
   utilized as data-driven evidence to facilitate clinicians, clinical
   researchers, and health care administrators to make more informed
   clinical, research, and administrative decisions. We utilized the
   following tools and the development environments to develop VIADS:
   Django, Python, JavaScript, Vis.js, Graph.js, JQuery, Plotly, Chart.js,
   Unittest, R, and MySQL.
   VIADS was developed successfully and the beta version is accessible
   publicly. In this paper, we introduce the architecture design,
   development, and functionalities of VIADS. VIADS includes six modules:
   user account management module, data sets validation module, data
   analytic module, data visualization module, terminology module,
   dashboard. Currently, VIADS supports health data sets coded by ICD-9,
   ICD-10, and MeSH. We also present the visualization improvement provided
   by VIADS in regard to interactive features (e.g., zoom in and out,
   customization of graph layout, expanded information of nodes, 3D plots)
   and efficient screen space usage.
   VIADS meets the design objectives and can be used to filter, summarize,
   compare, highlight and visualize large health data sets that coded by
   hierarchical terminologies, such as ICD-9, ICD-10 and MeSH. Our further
   usability and utility studies will provide more details about how the
   end users are using VIADS to facilitate their clinical, research or
   health administrative decision making.},

   Guideline Development Tool (GDT) online.
   Results: Forty-nine RCTs, all conducted in China, involving 3646
   participants were included. Most of the included trials had unclear or
   high risk of bias. Twenty-six trials could be pooled in five
   Meta-analyses, the remaining trials could not be pooled due to the
   obvious clinical heterogeneity. Only low evidence showed CHM therapy may
   have 42\%-60.4\% participants healed completely after treatment,
   approximately twice (RR 1.42-1.76) as much as the healed rates in
   conventional therapy (or plus hot water foot bath) group. Majority of
   the included trials reported benefit of CHM group on shortening healing
   time (4-23 days) and reducing ulcer wound size (at least 2 cm(2)). No
   serious adverse events were reported related to the medication in all
   trials.
   Conclusion: Weak evidence showed benefit of CHM as add-on treatment of
   conventional therapy on increasing number of ulcer heals in patients
   with DFU. That's about twice the healing rate of the conventional
   treatment (or plus hot water foot bath) group. With insufficient
   information, we could not draw confirmative conclusion on safety of CHM
   administration. These findings need to be tested in further large,
   rigorous trials.},

Title = {Effectiveness of cognitive-based interventions for improving body image
   of patients having breast cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY NURSING},

Abstract = {Objective: Breast cancer patients often suffer from body image
   disturbance due to impairment of their body/ appearance resulting from
   surgeries, other cancer treatments, and/or their complications.
   Cognitive-based interventions (CBIs) have recently been adopted for
   patients having breast cancer but their effects on improving body image
   are uncertain. This systematic review aimed to examine the effects of
   CBIs on body image in these patients, identify the optimal dose,
   characteristics, and/or component(s) of an effective intervention for
   these patients to inform future research and practice.Methods: According
   to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
   Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, ten online databases and five search
   engines were used to search for eligible studies. Quality appraisal of
   included studies and meta-analysis results were conducted using Rob 2
   and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation
   profiler Guideline Development Tool, respectively. RevMan and
   comprehensive meta-analysis software were used to perform data analysis
   and synthesis.Results: Eleven eligible randomized controlled trials
   (RCTs) examining the effects of cognitive behavioral, acceptance and
   commitment, mindfulness, and self-compassion therapies were reviewed.
   Results of the metaanalysis showed that CBIs significantly reduced
   negative body image perception (Standardised Mean Difference, SMD =
   -0.49, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], {[}-0.87, -0.11], I2 = 81\%, 6
   RCTs, 758 participants), when compared to the control groups (mainly
   usual care) at immediately post-intervention; in which, CBT-based (SMD =
   -0.37, 95\% CI (-0.60, -0.13), I2 = 0\%) and group-based (SMD = -0.38,
   95\% CI (-0.62, -0.13), I2 = 0\%) programs had more consistent and
   significant effects.Conclusions: In view of the highly heterogeneous and
   limited RCTs identified, high-quality controlled trials of CBIs for
   improving the body image of patients having breast cancer are suggested.

Title = {Experimental Design of an Adaptive LQG Controller for Battery
   Charger/Dischargers Featuring Low Computational Requirements},
Journal = {WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The growing use of DC/DC power converters has resulted in the
   requirement that their complex controllers be cheaper and smaller, thus
   using cost-effective implementations. For this purpose, it is necessary
   to decrease the computational burden in controller implementation to
   minimize the hardware requirements. This manuscript presents two methods
   for tuning an adaptive linear-quadratic-Gaussian voltage controller for
   a battery charger/discharger, implemented with a Sepic/Zeta converter,
   to work at any operating point. The first method is based on a lookup
   table to select, using the nearest method, both the state feedback
   vector and the observer gain vector, solving the Riccati's differential
   equation offline for each practical operating point. The second method
   defines a polynomial function for each controller element that is based
   on the previous data corresponding to the system operating points. The
   adaptability of the two controllers to fixed voltage regulation and
   reference tracking was validated using simulations and experimental
   tests. The overshoot and settling time results were lower than 11\% and
   3.7 ms, which are in the same orders of magnitude of a control approach
   in which the equations are solved online. Likewise, three indices were
   evaluated: central processing unit capacity, cost, and performance. This
   evaluation confirms that the controller based on polynomial
   interpolation is the best option of the two examined methods due to the
   satisfactory balance between dynamic performance and cost. Despite the
   advantages of the controllers in being based on a lookup table and
   polynomial interpolation, the adaptive linear-quadratic-Gaussian has the
   benefit of not requiring an offline training campaign; however, the cost
   saving obtained with the lookup table controllers and polynomial
   interpolation controllers, due to the possible implementation on
   small-size microcontrollers with development tool simple and easy
   maintenance, will surely be desirable for a large number of deployed
   units, ensuring that those solutions are highly cost-effective.},

   Source Text Analytics},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This software article describes the GATE family of open source text
   analysis tools and processes. GATE is one of the most widely used
   systems of its type with yearly download rates of tens of thousands and
   many active users in both academic and industrial contexts. In this
   paper we report three examples of GATE-based systems operating in the
   life sciences and in medicine. First, in genome-wide association studies
   which have contributed to discovery of a head and neck cancer mutation
   association. Second, medical records analysis which has significantly
   increased the statistical power of treatment/outcome models in the UK's
   largest psychiatric patient cohort. Third, richer constructs in
   drug-related searching. We also explore the ways in which the GATE
   family supports the various stages of the lifecycle present in our
   examples. We conclude that the deployment of text mining for document
   abstraction or rich search and navigation is best thought of as a
   process, and that with the right computational tools and data collection
   strategies this process can be made defined and repeatable. The GATE
   research programme is now 20 years old and has grown from its roots as a
   specialist development tool for text processing to become a rather
   comprehensive ecosystem, bringing together software developers, language
   engineers and research staff from diverse fields. GATE now has a strong
   claim to cover a uniquely wide range of the lifecycle of text analysis
   systems. It forms a focal point for the integration and reuse of
   advances that have been made by many people (the majority outside of the
   authors' own group) who work in text processing for biomedicine and
   other areas. GATE is available online < 1 > under GNU open source
   licences and runs on all major operating systems. Support is available
   from an active user and developer community and also on a commercial
   basis.},

Abstract = {Between August 2012 and April 2013 the Career Development Fellowship
   programme of the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical
   Diseases (World Health Organization) underwent an external evaluation to
   assess its past performance and determine recommendations for future
   programme development and continuous performance improvement. The
   programme provides a year-long training experience for qualified
   researchers from low and middle income countries at pharmaceutical
   companies or product development partnerships. Independent evaluators
   from the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute and the Barcelona
   Institute for Global Health used a results-based methodology to review
   the programme. Data were gathered through document review, surveys, and
   interviews with a range of programme participants. The final evaluation
   report found the Career Development Fellowship to be relevant to
   organizers' and programme objectives, efficient in its operations, and
   effective in its training scheme, which was found to address needs and
   gaps for both fellows and their home institutions. Evaluators found that
   the programme has the potential for impact and sustainability beyond the
   programme period, especially with the successful reintegration of
   fellows into their home institutions, through which newly-developed
   skills can be shared at the institutional level. Recommendations
   included the development of a scheme to support the re-integration of
   fellows into their home institutions post-fellowship and to seek
   partnerships to facilitate the scaling-up of the programme. The impact
   of the Professional Membership Scheme, an online professional
   development tool launched through the programme, beyond the scope of the
   Career Development Fellowship programme itself to other applications,
   has been identified as a positive unintended outcome. The results of
   this evaluation may be of interest for other efforts in the field of
   research capacity strengthening in LMICs or, generally, to other
   professional development schemes of a similar structure.},

Abstract = {Automatic milking system (AMS) adoption in the United States is trending
   upward, with issues such as lower availability and increased cost of
   labor being fac-tors frequently listed as motives for AMS
   implementa-tion. In addition, more interest in precision dairy farm-ing
   by the new generation of farmers may also help increase AMS adoption.
   The objective of this scoping review was to characterize the nature of
   the literature investigating non-pasture-based AMS and the
   opportu-nities and challenges for future research. The eligibility
   criteria included studies published in or after the year 2000, with full
   text in English, of at least 500 words, examining various outcomes
   related to AMS in non-pasture-based dairy farms. Six electronic
   databases were searched: Biosis (Web of Science), CAB Abstracts (CAB
   Direct), Medline (PubMed), PubAg, AGRIS (FAO), and Scopus (Elsevier).
   The review focused on studies with objectives, characteristics, farms,
   and AMS information. A total of 4,292 titles and abstracts were
   screened, and 536 studies were finally included. Most of the studies
   were conducted in Europe (73.5\%), among commercial herds (67.9\%),
   comprising Holstein cows (57.7\%), using Lely and DeLaval brands (45.4\%
   vs. 39.7\%), with free-flow traffic (52.7\%). The main research topics
   investigated were milk production, milk composition, and AMS efficiency,
   followed by behavior and welfare, health disorders (especially
   mastitis), and nutrition in Europe and other regions. At the same time,
   in the United States, trends were similar, except for nutrition. Since
   2016, there has been an increased interest in studies on energy and
   water consumption, technological development, environment (enteric
   emis-sions), reproduction, genetics, and longevity or culling. However,
   the small number of studies and unclear characterization of what is
   optimum for reproductive management, other health disorders, economics,
   and water and energy consumption suggest a need for fu-ture research.},

Abstract = {Background: My Health Record (MyHR) is Australia's national electronic
   health record (EHR) system. Poor usability and functionality have
   resulted in low utility, affecting enrollment and participation rates by
   both patients and clinicians alike. Similar to apps on mobile phone app
   stores, innovative third-party applications of MyHR platform data can
   enhance the usefulness of the platform, but there is a paucity of
   research into the processes involved in developing third-party
   applications that integrate and use data from EHR systems.
   Objective: The research describes the challenges involved in pioneering
   the development of a patient and clinician Web-based software
   application for MyHR and insights resulting from this experience.
   Methods: This research uses a case study approach, investigating the
   development and implementation of Actionable Intime Insights (AI(2)), a
   third-party application for MyHR, which translates Medicare claims
   records stored in MyHR into a clinically meaningful timeline
   visualization of health data for both patients and clinicians. This case
   study identifies the challenges encountered by the Personal Health
   Informatics team from Flinders University in the MyHR third-party
   application development environment.
   Results: The study presents a nuanced understanding of different data
   types and quality of data in MyHR and the complexities associated with
   developing secondary-use applications. Regulatory requirements
   associated with utilization of MyHR data, restrictions on visualizations
   of data, and processes of testing third-party applications were
   encountered during the development of the application.
   Conclusions: This study identified several processes, technical and
   regulatory barriers which, if addressed, can make MyHR a thriving
   ecosystem of health applications. It clearly identifies opportunities
   and considerations for the Australian Digital Health Agency and other
   national bodies wishing to encourage the development of new and
   innovative use cases for national EHRs.},

   development of the business layer of a Web 2.0 application.
   Method: We have conducted a quasi-experiment with 26 graduate students
   of the University of Alicante. The application developed was a Social
   Network, which was organized around a fixed set of modules. Three of
   them, similar in complexity, were used for the experiment. Subjects were
   asked to use a different method for each module, and then to answer a
   questionnaire that gathered their perceptions during such use.
   Results: The results show that the Model-Driven method is regarded as
   the most useful, although it is also considered the least compatible
   with previous developers' experiences. They also show that junior
   software developers feel comfortable with the use of models, and that
   they are likely to use them if the models are accompanied by a
   Model-Driven development environment.
   Conclusions: Despite their relatively low level of compatibility,
   Model-Driven development methods seem to show a great potential for
   adoption. That said, however, further experimentation is needed to make
   it possible to generalize the results to a different population,
   different methods, other languages and tools, different domains or
   different application sizes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Low-Code Development is a new software development paradigm which is
   typically used to generate web applications from high-level visual
   notations. These notations allow to express the User Interface and
   Application Logic (usersystem interactions) in a way which is
   understandable by the end-users. Using certain model-driven approaches,
   the low-code environments allow for generating the front-end layer and
   basic CRUD operations in the back-end. Yet still, non-standard domain
   logic (data processing) operations still necessitate the use of
   traditional programming. In this article we present a visual language,
   called RSL-DL that can be used to represent such non-standard domain
   logic in a visual form. It allows to capture domain knowledge with
   complex domain rules aligned with requirements models. The language
   synthesises and extends approaches found in knowledge representation
   (ontologies) and software modelling language engineering. The
   development environment of RSL-DL enables fully automatic generation of
   domain logic code by reasoning over and reusing domain knowledge. The
   environment includes a dedicated model editor and a transformation
   engine. The language's abstract syntax is defined using a meta-model
   expressed in MOF. Its semantics is expressed with several translational
   rules that map RSL-DL models onto typical programming language
   constructs. The article presents a list of these rules in an informal
   way, and then introduces their formalisation using a graphical
   transformation notation. The RSL-DL environment includes an inference
   engine that enables processing queries to domain models and selecting
   appropriate invocations to generated code. It was also initially
   validated through studies that involve understandability, operability
   and complexity assessment. Based on these results, we conclude that
   declarative knowledge representations can be successfully used to
   produce imperative backend code with non-trivial logic.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Anopheles sinensis is a key disease vector for human malaria and
   parasitic diseases such as malayan filariasis, and it is considered to
   be one of the most important malaria vectors in China and Southeast
   Asia. As high-throughput sequencing and assembly technology are widely
   used in An. sinensis, a lot of omics data have been generated, and
   abundant genome, mRNA transcriptome, miRNA transcriptome and
   resequencing results have been accumulated. In addition, lots of
   valuable morphological images and publications have been produced with
   the in-depth studies on An. sinensis. However, the increased quantity,
   variety, and structure complexity of the omics data create
   inconveniences for researchers to use and manage this information.
   We have built an An. sinensis omics database (ASDB,
   http://asdb.jungleran.com/) - a comprehensive and integrated database to
   promote scientific research on An. sinensis. Docker was used to deploy a
   development environment and Drupal to build ASDB. ASDB provides a Blast
   tool to do sequence alignment of genome sequence, gene sequence and
   protein sequence of An. sinensis. It also offers JBrowse (a
   next-generation genome visualization and analysis web platform) to
   facilitate researchers visualize the gene structure, non-coding RNA
   (include miRNA, snRNA, tRNA and so on) structure and genomic variation
   sites as desired.
   ASDB has integrated various latest omics data of An. Sinensis, including
   de novo genome and its annotation data, genome variation data (such as
   SNP and InDel), transcriptome and its expression value, miRNA expression
   value and miRNA-mRNA interaction, metagenomes. The database has also
   included the morphological images of different developmental stages and
   tissues, and important literatures associated with An. sinensis. ASDB
   provides a user-friendly search and displays pages. The integration of
   these resources will contribute to the study of basic biology and
   functional genome of An. sinensis.},

Title = {Implementation of Evidence-based Humanitarian Programs in Military-led
   Missions: Part I. Qualitative Gap Analysis of Current Military and
   International Aid Programs},
Journal = {DISASTER MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {2},

Abstract = {Background: A recent Department of Defense instruction mandates
   country-specific assessments, identification of interventions, and
   development of guidance for Department of Defense to plan, train, and
   prepare for the provision of humanitarian assistance in stability
   operations. It also directs the use of outcome-based measures of
   effectiveness and the establishment of processes facilitating
   transparency of information. Whereas this would align military-led
   projects closer to the standards of the international aid community, how
   this process will be developed and implemented within the military has
   not yet been determined.
   Methods: To begin developing an evidence-based program for military-led
   humanitarian aid, we conducted a qualitative gap analysis comparing
   information from a Web search of Department of Defense medical
   after-action reports, lessons learned, and expert interviews with the
   internationally accepted standards in humanitarian assistance impact
   assessment.
   Results: There is a major gap in the ability of the Department of
   Defense to assess the impact of humanitarian assistance in stability
   operations compared with international development standards. Of the
   1000 Department of Defense after-action reports and lessons learned
   reviewed, only 7 (0.7\%) reports refer to, but do not discuss, impact
   assessment or outcome-based measures of effectiveness.
   Conclusions: This investigation shows that the Department of Defense
   humanitarian assistance operations are, historically, recorded without
   documentation using quantifiable health data identifying which aid
   activities contributed directly to desired outcomes or favorable public
   opinion, and rarely are analyzed for effectiveness. As humanitarian
   assistance operations assume an ever greater role in US military
   strategy, it is imperative that we investigate useful impact assessment
   models to meet mission directives and, more important, to maximize
   coordination in a necessarily integrated and cooperative development
   environment. These findings provide baseline knowledge for the
   implementation of an evidence-based impact assessment process to
   validate future Department of Defense humanitarian assistance
   operations. (Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2008; 2: 230-236)},

Title = {A New Efficient Assembly Language Teaching Aid for Intel Processors},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Assembly 8086 language is an essential course that is taught in many
   universities offering computer engineering or science degree. However,
   the available software simulators that are used to write and run
   assembly programs do not fulfill the students' expectations due to being
   difficult to deal with and lacking a lot of necessary GUI features. In
   this article, we introduce a new Assembly Language Teaching Aid (ALTA32
   or ALTA8086) which is basically a simulator that helps much in
   delivering concepts related to assembly language programming course for
   Intel microprocessors (mu ps). Among current and relevant simulators,
   ALTA32 not only is the simplest and easiest to use, but also has the
   most fascinating user-friendly interface that exhibits constructive and
   informative features. Additionally, it offers multiple run modes with
   the option of writing programs directly or through loading existing
   files. It works efficiently in both 16-bit and 32-bit extensions
   considering real mode memory addressing. It supports all data and stack
   memory addressing modes along with all available directives to be used
   in both model and full-segment program approaches. Furthermore, to
   understand and recognize changes after execution, all affected fields
   are emphasized and shown using visual effects such as dynamic labels,
   blinking texts, as well as colored codes. On the other hand, it is
   widely known that the Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC)
   architecture, which is also a register-memory architecture, is
   characterized by affording many instructions with various operands,
   affected flags, complex operations, and sources of syntax errors.
   Although it is really challenging to build up a simulator that
   completely supports that wide range of Intel assembly instructions
   taking into account the variety in their lengths and formats, we
   succeeded eventually to eliminate the code redundancy and make our code
   readable, maintainable, and scalable through programming all
   instructions based on the methodology of combining or grouping all
   instructions that almost act similarly to follow a certain efficient
   algorithm. As a programming environment, VB.Net has been used to develop
   the ALTA32 simulator. Throughout our experience in teaching assembly
   8086 language programming course for CISC processors, we found many
   difficulties in getting the students familiar with well-known simulators
   such as Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM8086 or MASM32) or 8086 mu p
   Emulator (EMU8086). Nevertheless, the feedback from our students about
   ALTA32 simulator was so impressive and the complaints were totally
   disappeared. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Comput Appl Eng Educ

Month = {MAR 7},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND As a critical early event in hepatocellular carcinogenesis,
   telomerase activation might be a promising and critical biomarker for
   hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, and its function in the genesis
   and treatment of HCC has gained much attention over the past two
   decades. AIM To perform a bibliometric analysis to systematically assess
   the current state of research on HCC-related telomerase. METHODS The Web
   of Science Core Collection and PubMed were systematically searched to
   retrieve publications pertaining to HCC/telomerase limited to
   ``articles{''} and ``reviews{''} published in English. A total of 873
   relevant publications related to HCC and telomerase were identified. We
   employed the Bibliometrix package in R to extract and analyze the
   fundamental information of the publications, such as the trends in the
   publications, citation counts, most prolific or influential writers, and
   most popular journals; to screen for keywords occurring at high
   frequency; and to draw collaboration and cluster analysis charts on the
   basis of coauthorship and co-occurrences. VOSviewer was utilized to
   compile and visualize the bibliometric data. RESULTS A surge of 51
   publications on HCC/telomerase research occurred in 2016, the most
   productive year from 1996 to 2023, accompanied by the peak citation
   count recorded in 2016. Up to December 2023, 35226 citations were made
   to all publications, an average of 46.6 citations to each paper. The
   United States received the most citations (n = 13531), followed by China
   (n = 7427) and Japan (n = 5754). In terms of national cooperation, China
   presented the highest centrality, its strongest bonds being to the
   United States and Japan. Among the 20 academic institutions with the
   most publications, ten came from China and the rest of Asia, though the
   University of Paris Cite, Public Assistance-Hospitals of Paris, and the
   National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) were the most
   prolific. As for individual contributions, Hisatomi H, Kaneko S, and Ide
   T were the three most prolific authors. Kaneko S ranked first by
   H-index, G-index, and overall publication count, while Zucman-Rossi J
   ranked first in citation count. The five most popular journals were the
   World Journal of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Journal of Hepatology,
   Oncotarget, and Oncogene, while Nature Genetics, Hepatology, and Nature
   Reviews Disease Primers had the most citations. We extracted 2293
   keywords from the publications, 120 of which appeared more than ten
   times. The most frequent were HCC, telomerase and human telomerase
   reverse transcriptase (hTERT). Keywords such as mutational landscape,
   TERT promoter mutations, landscape, risk, and prognosis were among the
   most common issues in this field in the last three years and may be
   topics for research in the coming years. CONCLUSION Our bibliometric
   analysis provides a comprehensive overview of HCC/telomerase research
   and insights into promising upcoming research.},

Abstract = {COVID-19 pandemic seriousness is making the whole world suffer due to
   inefficient medication and vaccines. The article prediction analysis is
   carried out with the dataset downloaded from the Application peripheral
   interface (API) designed explicitly for COVID-19 quarantined patients.
   The measured data is collected from a wearable device used for
   quarantined healthy and unhealthy patients. The wearable device provides
   data of temperature, heart rate, SPO2, blood saturation, and blood
   pressure timely for alerting the medical authorities and providing a
   better diagnosis and treatment. The dataset contains 1085 patients with
   eight features representing 490 COVID19 infected and 595 standard cases.
   The work considers different parameters, namely heart rate, temperature,
   SpO(2), bpm parameters, and health status.\& nbsp;Furthermore, the
   real-time data collected can predict the health status of patients as
   infected and non infected from measured parameters. The collected
   dataset uses a random forest classifier with linear and polynomial
   regression to train and validate COVID-19 patient data. The google colab
   is an Integral development environment inbuilt with python and Jupyter
   notebook with scikit-learn version 0.22.1 virtually tested on cloud
   coding tools. The dataset is trained and tested in 80\% and 20\% ratio
   for accuracy evaluation and avoid overfitting in the model. This
   analysis could help medical authorities and governmental agencies of
   every country respond timely and reduce the contamination of the
   disease.\& nbsp;The measured data provide a comprehensive mapping of

Title = {EQUIDopa: A responsive web application for the levodopa equivalent dose
   calculator},
Journal = {COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {196},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background and objective: Levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel infusion is
   a treatment option for patients of advanced stage of Parkinson's
   disease. This treatment requires the time-consuming and error-prone
   conversion of orally taken antiparkinson drugs into an equivalent
   replacing dose of levodopa/carbidopa, which is delivered via pump. In
   order to facilitate and speed up this conversion process, we developed a
   specific user-friendly application that would be available online or as
   a standalone mobile application. Such an application has now been
   written and designed in collaboration with a computer scientist and
   physician, who is also intended to be the final user.
   Methods: The levodopa equivalent dose calculations are based on previous
   studies and data reported in the literature. Two related on-line
   conversion applications were analyzed and evaluated. The primary
   objectives of the application were determined, and basic functionalities
   were outlined. The application was implemented using modern development
   tools and frameworks.
   Results: The application has proven to be effective and easy to use in
   our clinical setting. It can serve as a control for manual calculations
   made by medical staff. It can also be applied as a useful tool in
   levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel infusion courses for the advanced
   treatment of Parkinson's disease.
   Conclusion: The presented application could replace the tedious and
   error-prone levodopa equivalent dose conversion of antiparkinson drugs
   efficiently. In comparison to related on-line conversion applications,
   this specific application provides more functionality, reduces the risk
   of user errors, and can be run on a variety of devices. The conversion
   value provided by the application is only an estimate. The effect of the
   drugs is specific for each individual patient, which could not be
   considered in the calculations. Therefore, the responsibility of using
   the results of the application rests with the clinical judgment of the
   user. Nevertheless, the application can give us a good starting point
   for the initial pump setting, which would be adjusted further during the
   titration period, according to the patient's response. (C) 2020 The

Abstract = {This article starts from a personal vision according to which any
   adolescent could develop personally and socially, anywhere and anytime,
   if he had an environment with offering learning experiences, he would
   acquire development tools, which he could use throughout life and would
   benefit from the support of the main educational partners (family,
   school, community) in his training.
   Starting from this vision, between December 2018 and June 2019, we
   initiated and carried out an exploratory study, within the Department of
   Educational Sciences, at the Faculty of Psychology and Educational
   Sciences of the ``Babes-Bolyai{''} University, Cluj-Napoca under
   coordination of the University Professor Vasile Chis, who aimed to
   identify the educational needs of adolescents in Romania, for the design
   and implementation of educational programs, for their personal and
   social development. In the study, we asked teenagers to fill an online
   questionnaire, in which they were encouraged to answer questions openly
   and honestly, the answers being anonymous and the lack of answer
   variants being considered to be correct or wrong. Over 750 respondents
   provided answers to the questions ``What would you like to learn if you
   could choose{''} and ``What would you most like to do in life, if you
   had the time, energy, money, self-confidence and support of your
   family?{''}. The results of the study open the discussion on the need to
   approach education from a multilateral and personalized perspective,
   depending on the individual needs of the beneficiaries. In the context
   in which education for well-being begins in the first years of family
   life, continues in school, can be extended to nongovernmental
   organizations and is supported by the community and businesses
   throughout life, this work reflects the current needs of education,
   anchored to the future aspirations of adolescents in Romania. Based on
   the results of this study can be outlined a portrait of the Romanian
   adolescent, ideas for personalizing education and solutions for
   educational agents to design and implement programs and projects adapted
   to the educational needs of today's adolescents, tomorrow's adults.},

Title = {Organizational career development versus employees' career needs in
   Hungary},
Journal = {STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Pages = {3-12},
Abstract = {The aim of the study is to prove that individuals still need the help of
   their employer to develop their career. Therefore, the paper
   investigates what kind of career support the employees expect from their
   employers and compare them to what they actually receive from the
   organization. The focus is on the career development tools applied by
   the organizations. Using quantitative research methods via an online
   survey of 1000 Hungarian employees, this study explores the extent of
   career development technic usage. It explores the solutions which are
   preferred by the individuals and also demonstrates the tools used by the
   organizations. Furthermore, the expected and perceived career support
   from different actors (managers, HR representatives, mentors, colleagues
   or external consultant) of the career process is measured and the
   perceived career opportunities are also evaluated. The most frequently
   applied tools are special work tasks, project work, networking
   opportunities, training opportunities and performance appraisal as a
   basis for career planning, as well as mentoring and coaching. The most
   often used career management solutions are applied mostly by the most
   employees; therefore, we can conclude that these are the most popular
   career interventions. All career management solutions were rated as
   useful by the respondents on average. However, the efficiency order set
   by respondents is different from the frequency of use. Career management
   tools that are evaluated most effective by employees are the following:
   training opportunities, projects to stimulate learning, networking
   opportunities, special tasks and promotion, succession planning. On
   average, respondents were partially informed and career prospects partly
   meet their expectations. Majority of the workers would expect help in
   developing their careers, but only few of them actually get support. In
   conclusion the employers should consider to apply certain career
   management tools more often as they do or they should involve in it more
   workers. For more effective cooperation, it would be worth to inform
   better their employees about career opportunities and give them more
   career support because they would require it.},

Title = {Omni-script: Device independent user interface development for
   omni-channel fintech applications},
Journal = {COMPUTER STANDARDS \& INTERFACES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {64},
Pages = {106-116},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {As the number of devices and platforms gradually increased that serve as
   a medium for online banking services, the number of replicated services
   for different platforms also increase. Each service has a different
   representation in a different platform even though targeting the same
   business objectives. This situation results in the problem of
   re-developing similar set of requirements for different devices and
   services which in turn results in multiplied effort in software
   development and degradation in the software quality because of the
   replicated code. The objective of this paper is to present a device
   independent user interface development approach that eliminates the
   replicated user interface development effort of the same set of services
   for different platforms/devices while increasing the presentation
   performance. In this context, we provide a basic technique that uses a
   json based user interface definition format, called omni-script, to
   separate the representation of banking services in different
   platforms/devices, so called channels. Omni-script is a pioneering
   solution being used in a real development environment in banking
   software domain that is experiencing a shift towards omni-channel user
   experience, where users are able to seamlessly continue using banking
   services in different platforms and devices. As the evaluation method,
   we have measured the actual development effort on a representative
   sample development team and a set of services. Additionally, we later
   deployed and measured the rendering time and the amount of data
   communication for the proposed approach in a real production
   environment. Production deployment resulted in a remarkable decrease in
   data communication and in loading times at the client side. As
   importantly, the proposed approach also resulted in a nearly 75\%
   decrease in service development time by enabling analysts to produce
   user interface prototypes that can be integrated to service development
   with minimal effort.},

Title = {AdaptiveVLE: An Integrated Framework for Personalized Online Education
   Using MPS JetBrains Domain-Specific Modeling Environment},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {184621-184632},
Abstract = {This article contains the design and development of an Adaptive Virtual
   Learning Environment (AdaptiveVLE) framework to assist educators of all
   disciplines with creating adaptive VLEs tailored to their needs and to
   contribute towards the creation of a more generic framework for adaptive
   systems. Fully online education is a major trend in education technology
   of our times. However, it has been criticised for its lack of
   personalisation and therefore not adequately addressing individual
   students ; needs. Adaptivity and intelligence are elements that could
   substantially improve the student experience and enhance the learning
   taking place. There are several attempts in academia and in industry to
   provide adaptive VLEs and therefore personalise educational provision.
   All these attempts require a multiple-domain (multi-disciplinary)
   approach from education professionals, software developers, data
   scientists to cover all aspects of the system. An integrated environment
   that can be used by all the multiple-domain users mentioned above and
   will allow for quick experimentation of different approaches is
   currently missing. Specifically, a transparent approach that will enable
   the educator to configure the data collected and the way it is processed
   without any knowledge of software development and/or data science
   algorithms implementation details is required. In our proposed work, we
   developed a new language/framework using MPS JetBrains Domain-Specific
   Language (DSL) development environment to address this problem. Our work
   consists of the following stages: data collection configuration by the
   educator, implementation of the adaptive VLE, data processing,
   adaptation of the learning path. These stages correspond to the
   adaptivity stages of all adaptive systems such as monitoring, processing
   and adaptation. The extension of our framework to include other
   application areas such as business analytics, health analytics, etc. so
   that it becomes a generic framework for adaptive systems as well as more
   usability testing for all applications will be part of our future work.},

Title = {A Toolkit for bulk PCR-based marker design from next-generation sequence
   data: application for development of a framework linkage map in bulb
   onion (<i>Allium cepa</i> L.)},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {13},
Month = {NOV 19},
Abstract = {Background: Although modern sequencing technologies permit the ready
   detection of numerous DNA sequence variants in any organisms, converting
   such information to PCR-based genetic markers is hampered by a lack of
   simple, scalable tools. Onion is an example of an under-researched crop
   with a complex, heterozygous genome where genome-based research has
   previously been hindered by limited sequence resources and genetic
   markers.
   Results: We report the development of generic tools for large-scale
   web-based PCR-based marker design in the Galaxy bioinformatics
   framework, and their application for development of next-generation
   genetics resources in a wide cross of bulb onion (Allium cepa L.).
   Transcriptome sequence resources were developed for the homozygous
   doubled-haploid bulb onion line `CUDH2150' and the genetically distant
   Indian landrace `Nasik Red', using 454 (TM) sequencing of normalised
   cDNA libraries of leaf and shoot. Read mapping of `Nasik Red' reads onto
   `CUDH2150' assemblies revealed 16836 indel and SNP polymorphisms that
   were mined for portable PCR-based marker development. Tools for
   detection of restriction polymorphisms and primer set design were
   developed in BioPython and adapted for use in the Galaxy workflow
   environment, enabling large-scale and targeted assay design. Using
   PCR-based markers designed with these tools, a framework genetic linkage
   map of over 800cM spanning all chromosomes was developed in a subset of
   93 F-2 progeny from a very large F-2 family developed from the `Nasik
   Red' x `CUDH2150' inter-cross. The utility of tools and genetic
   resources developed was tested by designing markers to transcription
   factor-like polymorphic sequences. Bin mapping these markers using a
   subset of 10 progeny confirmed the ability to place markers within 10 cM
   bins, enabling increased efficiency in marker assignment and targeted
   map refinement. The major genetic loci conditioning red bulb colour (R)
   and fructan content (Frc) were located on this map by QTL analysis.
   Conclusions: The generic tools developed for the Galaxy environment
   enable rapid development of sets of PCR assays targeting sequence
   variants identified from Illumina and 454 sequence data. They enable
   non-specialist users to validate and exploit large volumes of
   next-generation sequence data using basic equipment.},

Title = {Demystifying the Soft and Hardened Memory Systems of Modern FPGAs for
   Software Programmers through Microbenchmarking},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON RECONFIGURABLE TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Both modern datacenter and embedded Field Programmable Gate Arrays
   (FPGAs) provide great opportunities for high-performance and
   high-energy-efficiency computing. With the growing public availability
   of FPGAs from major cloud service providers such as AWS, Alibaba, and
   Nimbix, as well as uniform hardware accelerator development tools (such
   as Xilinx Vitis and Intel oneAPI) for software programmers, hardware and
   software developers can now easily access FPGA platforms. However, it is
   nontrivial to develop efficient FPGA accelerators, especially for
   software programmers who use high-level synthesis (HLS).
   The major goal of this article is to figure out how to efficiently
   access the memory system of modern datacenter and embedded FPGAs in
   HLS-based accelerator designs. This is especially important for
   memory-bound applications; for example, a naive accelerator design only
   utilizes less than 5\% of the available off-chip memory bandwidth. To
   achieve our goal, we first identify a comprehensive set of factors that
   affect the memory bandwidth, including (1) the clock frequency of the
   accelerator design, (2) the number of concurrent memory access ports,
   (3) the data width of each port, (4) the maximum burst access length for
   each port, and (5) the size of consecutive data accesses. Then, we
   carefully design a set of HLS-based microbenchmarks to quantitatively
   evaluate the performance of the memory systems of datacenter FPGAs
   (Xilinx Alveo U200 and U280) and embedded FPGA (Xilinx ZCU104) when
   changing those affecting factors, and we provide insights into efficient
   memory access in HLS-based accelerator designs. Comparing between the
   typically used soft and hardened memory systems, respectively, found on
   datacenter and embedded FPGAs, we further summarize their unique
   features and discuss the effective approaches to leverage these systems.
   To demonstrate the usefulness of our insights, we also conduct two case
   studies to accelerate the widely used K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and
   sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) algorithms on datacenter
   FPGAs with a soft (and thus more flexible) memory system. Compared to
   the baseline designs, optimized designs leveraging our insights achieve
   about 3.5x and 8.5x speedups for the KNN and SpMV accelerators. Our
   final optimized KNN and SpMV designs on a Xilinx Alveo U200 FPGA fully
   utilize its off-chip memory bandwidth, and achieve about 5.6x and 3.4x
   speedups over the 24-core CPU implementations.},

Abstract = {A data acquisition and control system (DACS) for high-speed gamma-ray
   tomography based on the USB (Universal Serial Bus) and Ethernet
   communication protocols has been designed and implemented. The
   high-speed gamma-ray tomograph comprises five 500 mCi Am-241 gamma-ray
   sources, each at a principal energy of 59.5 keV, which corresponds to
   five detector modules, each consisting of 17 CdZnTe detectors. The DACS
   design is based on Microchip's PIC18F4550 and PIC18F4620
   microcontrollers, which facilitates an USB 2.0 interface protocol and an
   Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) interface protocol, respectively. By implementing
   the USB- and Ethernet-based DACS, a sufficiently high data acquisition
   rate is obtained and no dedicated hardware installation is required for
   the data acquisition computer, assuming that it is already equipped with
   a standard USB and/or Ethernet port. The API (Application Programming
   Interface) for the DACS is founded on the National Instrument's LabVIEW
   (R) graphical development tool, which provides a simple and robust
   foundation for further application software developments for the
   tomograph. The data acquisition interval, i.e. the integration time, of
   the high-speed gamma-ray tomograph is user selectable and is a function
   of the statistical measurement accuracy required for the specific
   application. The bandwidth of the DACS is 85 kBytes s(-1) for the USB
   communication protocol and 28 kBytes s(-1) for the Ethernet protocol.
   When using the iterative least square technique reconstruction algorithm
   with a 1 ms integration time, the USB-based DACS provides an online
   image update rate of 38 Hz, i.e. 38 frames per second, whereas 31 Hz for
   the Ethernet-based DACS. The off-line image update rate (storage to
   disk) for the USB-based DACS is 278 Hz using a 1 ms integration time.
   Initial characterization of the high-speed gamma-ray tomograph using the
   DACS on polypropylene phantoms is presented in the paper.},

   no significant difference between the MMF group and the control group
   {[}RD = 0.02, 95\%CI (-0.04, 0.09), P = 0.46]. Conclusion: The therapy
   of mycophenolate mofetil in the treatment of SDNS or FRNS in children
   has a certain advantage in reducing the number of relapses and
   cumulative prednisone dosage within 1 year when compared with the CNIs
   and levamisole. However, due to the limited quantity and quality of the
   included studies, the conclusions above need to be confirmed by more
   high-quality randomized controlled trials.},

Title = {Automated end user-centred adaptation of web components through
   automated description logic-based reasoning},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {57},
Pages = {446-462},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Context: This paper addresses one of the major end-user development
   (EUD) challenges, namely, how to pack today's EUD support tools with
   composable elements. This would give end users better access to more
   components which they can use to build a solution tailored to their own
   needs. The success of later end-user software engineering (EUSE)
   activities largely depends on how many components each tool has and how
   adaptable components are to multiple problem domains.
   Objective: A system for automatically adapting heterogeneous components
   to a common development environment would offer a sizeable saving of
   time and resources within the EUD support tool construction process.
   This paper presents an automated adaptation system for transforming EUD
   components to a standard format.
   Method: This system is based on the use of description logic. Based on a
   generic UML2 data model, this description logic is able to check whether
   an end-user component can be transformed to this modelling language
   through subsumption or as an instance of the UML2 model. Besides it
   automatically finds a consistent, non-ambiguous and finite set of XSLT
   mappings to automatically prepare data in order to leverage the
   component as part of a tool that conforms to the target UML2 component
   model.
   Results: The proposed system has been successfully applied to components
   from four prominent EUD tools. These components were automatically
   converted to a standard format. In order to validate the proposed
   system, rich intemet applications (RIA) used as an operational support
   system for operators at a large services company were developed using
   automatically adapted standard format components. These RIAs would be
   impossible to develop using each EUD tool separately.
   Conclusion: The positive results of applying our system for
   automatically adapting components from current tool catalogues are
   indicative of the system's effectiveness. Use of this system could
   foster the growth of web EUD component catalogues, leveraging a vast
   ecosystem of user-centred SaaS to further current EUSE trends. (C) 2014

Title = {Extensible Tooling for Reactive Programming Based on},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OBJECT TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Reactive programming uses dedicated language concepts such as signals,
   data bindings, and constraints, so developers can better express
   behavior that is triggered by data changes and user interactions. As
   applications also contain aspects that cannot be easily expressed
   through reactive programming, reactive concepts are often integrated
   into more generally applicable imperative programming languages.
   Although such language integrations are readily available, working on
   reactive code with tools designed for imperative code is hard, because
   without dedicated tool support implementation details may leak
   unintentionally. There are special tools for reactive programming
   available, however, they are expensive to make. Further, a tool
   typically supports only a single language concept and cannot be applied
   to others even though they build on similar ideas. Consequently, control
   flow or data flow cannot be followed between concepts. We propose to
   leverage the commonalities found in reactive programming concepts to
   create reusable tool components for data gathering and visualization. To
   do so we create a toolset working on a generalization of reactive
   programming concepts, Active Expressions. By building upon the generic
   tool components, tool developers can create tool support for specific
   reactive concepts. Furthermore, multiple reactive concepts and their
   potentially complex interaction can be explored in one shared
   environment. We implemented the approach in the Lively4 Web-based
   JavaScript development environment using its Active Expression
   framework. Our toolset gathers relevant data about the reactive system
   and visualizes it using code annotations, an overview tree, an event
   timeline, and a dependency graph. We evaluate the reusability of this
   toolset by adapting it to two more concepts: signals, and implicit layer
   activation, known from context-oriented programming. We found that most
   of the functionality provided by the toolset can be reused, thus,
   reducing the implementation effort. Further, we show that multiple
   reactive concepts can be supported by the same common toolset.
   Programmers can use and debug multiple different reactive concepts
   simultaneously, without requiring new tools for each one. For future
   work, we believe our common toolset provides a starting point for
   researching the interplay between multiple reactive programming
   concepts.},

Title = {Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of
   perioperative outcomes and prognosis of transurethral en-bloc resection
   vs. conventional transurethral resection for non-muscle-invasive bladder
   cancer},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {104},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Objectives: This article aimed to perform a systematic review and
   meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of perioperative
   outcomes and prognosis of transurethral en-bloc resection versus
   conventional transurethral resection for non-muscle-invasive bladder
   cancer (NMIBC).
   Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane
   Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL) to find eligible RCTs. The
   studies were classified by version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool
   for randomized trials. Review Manager 5.4.0 was used to evaluate the
   data. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Guideline
   Development Tool by GRADEpro GDT.
   Results: Seven RCTs with 1142 patients was included in the present
   study. The results indicated that bladder perforation (OR = 0.17; 95\%
   CI 0.05 to 0.67; P = 0.01), obturator nerve reflex (OR = 0.03; 95\% CI
   0.01 to 0.13; P < 0.00001), residual tumor (OR = 0.24; 95\% CI 0.08 to
   0.77; P = 0.02) and repeat transurethral resection of bladder tumor
   (re-TURBT) (OR = 0.54; 95\% CI 0.34 to 0.85; P = 0.008) were
   significantly reduced in the en-bloc resection group than the
   conventional resection group. However, there were no significant
   differences in hemoglobin deficit (p = 0.31), urethral stricture (p =
   0.47), and detrusor muscle presence (P = 0.16) between both groups.
   Besides, resection time (p = 0.25), operative time (p = 0.20), catheter
   dwell time (p = 0.24), and length of hospital stay (p = 0.16) were
   similar in the two groups. Meanwhile, en-bloc resection yielded no
   advantage for the 3-month (P = 0.11), 6-month (P = 0.05), 1-year (P =
   0.61), 2-year (P = 0.53), and 3-year (P = 0.26) tumor recurrence rates.
   Conclusions: Our meta-analysis shows that transurethral en-bloc
   resection is associated with comparable outcomes to conventional
   transurethral resection for recurrence-free survival in NMIBC patients.
   En-bloc resection is more feasible and safer than conventional resection
   for NMIBC, with fewer intraoperative complications, less residual tumor,
   and less re-TURBT.},

Title = {Romanian complex data center for dense seismic network},
Journal = {ANNALS OF GEOPHYSICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {54},
Number = {1},
Pages = {9-16},
Abstract = {In 2002, the National Institute for Earth Physics started the
   development of its own real-time digital seismic network. This now
   consists of 86 seismic stations, of which 32 are broad-band sensors, 52
   stations are equipped with short-period sensors, and two seismic arrays,
   all of which transmit data in real time to the National Data Center
   (NDC) and the Eforie Nord (EFOR) seismic observatory. EFOR is the
   back-up for the NDC, and it is also a monitoring center for Black Sea
   tsunamis. The seismic stations are equipped with Quanterra Q330 and K2
   digitizers, broad-band seismometers (STS2, CMG40T, CMG 3ESP, CMG3T) and
   Episensor Kinemetrics acceleration sensors (+/- 2g). SeedLink is a part
   of Seiscomp2.5 and Antelope, which are the software packages used for
   data acquisition in real time and data exchange. Communication from the
   digital seismic stations to the NDC in Bucharest and EFOR is assured by
   five providers (GPRS, VPN, satellite, radio and internet). AntelopeTM
   4.11 is used for acquisition and data processing at these two data
   centers for the reception and processing of the data, which runs on two
   workstations: one for real-time processing and the other for off-line
   processing. A Seiscomp 3 server works as the back-up for the Antelope
   4.11. This acquisition and analysis systems for the seismic data produce
   information about the local and global parameters of earthquakes. In
   addition, Antelope is used for manual processing (e. g. association
   events, creation of a database, sending seismic bulletins, and
   calculation of magnitude and peak ground acceleration and velocity),
   generation of ShakeMap products, and interactions with global data
   centers. The NDC has developed tools to make all of this information
   easily available across the internet, and also to lay the grounds for a
   more modular and flexible development environment. This will enable
   centralizing of the data from software such as Antelope, which is using
   a dedicated database system (Datascope; a database system based on text
   files), to the more general-purpose database, MySQL. This acts like a
   hub between the different acquisition and analysis systems used at the
   NDC, while also providing better connectivity at no expense to security.
   Mirroring certain data to MySQL also allows the NDC to easily share
   information with the public, via the new application that is being
   developed, and also to mix in data collected from the public (e. g.
   information about the damage after an earthquake, which can be used to
   produce macroseismic intensity indices that are then stored in the
   database and also made available via the web application). For internal
   use, there is also a web application that uses the data stored in the
   database to display earthquake information, like location, magnitude and
   depth, in semi real time, thus aiding the personnel on duty. Another use
   for the data collected is to create and maintain contact lists to which
   the datacenter sends notifications (SMS and email), based on the
   parameters of an earthquake. For the future development, one of the NDC
   plans is to develop the means to cross-check the data generated between
   the different acquisition and analysis systems (e. g. comparing data
   generated by Antelope with data generated by Seiscomp).},

Volume = {74},

Abstract = {This study is to research and develop a native application based
   development tool which can perfectly satisfy both OSMU and
   cross-platform, and secure stable H/W control and execution speed.
   Additionally, this study is to enable developers in beginner or
   intermediate level to develop an application with the `zero coding
   methodology' reflected tool developed by this study and not using the
   conventional program coding methods, eventually providing the
   environment that anyone, who can use MS office programs, can easily
   develop an application. The explosively increasing demand for the
   development of mobile apps is due to all works on typical PCs that
   should be converted to the smart basis. Although functions to be
   implemented are the same, different apps should be developed for each
   platform to result in cost, period and task forces increased a few
   times. The web-based application platform emerging as a solution for
   cross platforms is not capable of embodying the desired One Source Multi
   Use due to speed, UI, and technical incompleteness. Therefore if a
   ``native-based OSMU development platform{''} is implemented which can
   develop native apps operating in various mobile operating systems, their
   high development productivity will contribute to remarkably reduced task
   forces, costs and time for development and maintenance. Also it will be
   possible to preoccupy the market of a potential as great as the exiting
   operating systems, for example, Android, iOS, Windows 8, etc. In order
   to develop and makes fullest use of smart app authoring tool different
   approaches should be appropriately employed. Firstly, it is required to
   have a close relation with legacy systems. Secondly, developers are
   fully qualified to use office programs. Thirdly, different programs
   should be also differently developed for business uses. This study aims
   to commercialize the authoring tool technology of the GUI method without
   coding and the source technology for driving apps in the cross platform
   environment. The high development productivity of one source multi use
   cross-platform based on Zero Coding will contribute to remarkably
   reduced task forces, costs and time for development and maintenance. The
   final goal of this paper is to establish operating platform specialized
   for business under predominant operating systems such as Google's
   Android or Apple's iOS, and to create making tools for application
   programs based on GUI, in which anyone can easily learn and implement by
   this platform.},

Title = {Efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicine for intracranial
   hemorrhage by promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis: A
   systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {SEP 28},
Abstract = {Background: Although blood-activating Chinese medicine (BACM) has been
   reported as adjuvant therapy for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in China,
   high-quality evidence is still lacking. Our study aimed to collect the
   latest high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and to evaluate
   the efficacy and safety of BACM for ICH. Methods: RCTs published between
   January 2015 and March 2022 were searched in databases, including China
   National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology
   Journal Database (VIP), Sino-Med, Wanfang, PubMed, Web of Science,
   Cochrane Library, and Embase without language restrictions. Eligible
   RCTs were included and both primary (clinical efficacy evidenced by
   decreased neurological deficit scores) and secondary outcomes (increased
   Barthel index, decreased NIHSS, hematoma volume, the volume of cerebral
   edema, the incidence of side effects, and mortality) were analyzed. The
   quality of included RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias
   tool. In the meta-analysis, the pooled results were analyzed using
   Review Manager 5.3 and STATA14.0. Finally, The GRADEpro GDT software
   (Guideline Development Tool) was used to summarize the results.
   Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were conducted based on the follow-up
   time. Results: Fifteen RCTs, involving 1,579 participants, were included
   for analysis in our study. The pooled outcomes indicated that BACM
   combined with western medicine treatment (WMT) was superior to WMT alone
   for patients with ICH, demonstrated by the improvements in efficacy (RR
   = 1.22 (95\% CI, {[}1.13 to 1.32], p < 0.001), neurological functions
   (MDNIHSS = -2.75, 95\% CI {[}-3.74 to -1.76], p < 0.001), and activities
   of daily living (MDBarthel index = 5.95, 95\% CI {[}3.92 to 7.98], p <
   0.001), as well as decreased cerebral hematoma, cerebral edema (MD
   cerebral hematoma = -2.94, 95\% CI {[}-3.50 to -2.37, p < 0.001 and
   MDcerebral edema = -2.66, 95\% CI {[}-2.95 to -2.37], p < 0.001), side
   effects and mortality (RR = 0.84 (95\% CI {[}0.60 to 1.19], p = 0.330
   and RR = 0.51 (95\% CI, {[}0.16 to 1.65], p = 0.260). In addition,
   Conioselinum anthriscoides ``Chuanxiong `` {[}Apiaceae], Camellia
   reticulata Lindl. {[}Theaceae], and Bupleurum sibiricum var. jeholense
   (Nakai) C.D.Chu {[}Apiaceae]) were the most frequently used herbs in the
   treatment of ICH. Recently, there was a trend toward the extensive use
   of another two herbs, including Rheum palmatum L. {[}Polygonaceae],
   Astragalus mongholicus Bunge {[}Fabaceae]) for ICH. Conclusion: BACM
   combined with WMT seems to be superior to WMT alone for patients with
   ICH. Further high-quality RCTs are warranted to confirm the efficacy and
   safety of BACM.},

Abstract = {RSSB and the University of Southampton's GeoData Institute have
   collaborated to research and develop a toolkit for managing large
   volumes of rail risk data. The pilot system encompasses concepts of
   highly complex geospatial big data', open standards, open source
   development tools and methodologies, and enables stakeholders to filter,
   analyse and visualise risk across the rail network, for a range of risk
   models. These include train derailments, suicides and passenger slip,
   trips and falls, and feature a wide range of spatially dependent
   parameters that affect the causal, escalation and consequence
   mechanisms. The risk has been calculated to a high resolution, splitting
   2,100,000 m of track typically into 10 m sections. By creating
   geospatial representations of risk, the tool can help to identify risk
   hotspots and in this way contribute to the improvement of rail safety.
   Once scaled up to a National level and full range of risk models, the
   tool will deliver a powerful capability, unique across Europe. Further
   research is extending the prototype to incorporate live and historic
   environmental and related rail incident data to augment and improve the
   risk model.},

Title = {Generalizable Layered Blockchain Architecture for Health Care
   Applications: Development, Case Studies, and Evaluation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 27},
Abstract = {Background: Data coordination across multiple health care facilities has
   become increasingly important for many emerging health care
   applications. Distrust has been recognized as a key barrier to the
   success of such applications. Leveraging blockchain technology could
   provide potential solutions tobuild trust between data providers and
   receivers by taking advantage of blockchain properties such as security,
   immutability, anonymity, decentralization, and smart contracts. Many
   health technologies have empirically proven that blockchain designs fit
   well with the needs of health care applications with certain degrees of
   success. However, there is a lack of robust architecture to provide a
   practical framework for developers to implement applications and test
   the performance of stability, efficiency, and scalability using standard
   blockchain designs. A generalized blockchain model is needed for the
   health care community to adopt blockchain technology and develop
   applications in a timely fashion.
   Objective: This study aimed at building a generalized blockchain
   architecture that provides data coordination functions, including data
   requests, permission granting, data exchange, and usage tracking, for a
   wide spectrum of health care application developments.
   Methods: An augmented, 3-layered blockchain architecture was built on a
   private blockchain network. The 3 layers, from bottom to top, are as
   follows: (1) incorporation of fundamental blockchain settings and smart
   contract design for data collection; (2) interactions between the
   blockchain and health care application development environment using
   Nodejs and web3 js; and (3) a flexible development platform that
   supports web technologies such as HTML, https, and various programing
   languages. Two example applications, health information exchange (HIE)
   and clinical trial recruitment, were developed in our design to
   demonstrate the feasibility of the layered architecture. Case studies
   were conducted to test the performance in terms of stability,
   efficiency, and scalability of the blockchain system.
   Results: A total of 331,142 simulated HIE requests from accounts of
   40,000 patients were successfully validated through this layered
   blockchain architecture with an average exchange time of 11.271 (SD
   2.208) seconds. We also simulated a clinical trial recruitment scenario
   with the same set of patients and various recruitment criteria to match
   potential subjects using the same architecture. Potential subjects
   successfully received the clinical trial recruitment information and
   granted permission to the trial sponsors to access their health records
   with an average time of 3.07 seconds.
   Conclusions: This study proposes a generalized layered blockchain
   architecture that offers health technology community blockchain features
   for application development without requiring developers to have
   extensive experience with blockchain technology. The case studies tested
   the performance of our design and empirically proved the feasibility of
   the architecture in 2 relevant health application domains.},

Title = {The Development of a Hypertension Prevention and Financial-Incentive
   mHealth Program Using a ``No-Code{''} Mobile App Builder: Development
   and Usability Study},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {7},
Abstract = {Background: Regular physical activity (PA) is a key lifestyle component
   for hypertension prevention. Previous studies have shown that mobile
   health (mHealth) apps can be an effective tool for improving PA
   behaviors. However, adherence to and poor engagement with these apps is
   a challenge. A potential solution to overcome this challenge may be to
   combine financial incentives with innovative behavior theory, such as
   the Multiprocess Action Control (M-PAC) framework. Currently, there is a
   lack of PA financial incentive-driven M-PAC mHealth programs aimed at
   hypertension prevention. Objective: We aimed to describe the process of
   developing an 8-week mHealth PA and financial-incentive hypertension
   education program (Healthy Hearts) and to evaluate usability of the
   Healthy Hearts program. Methods: The first 2 stages of the Integrate,
   Design, Assess, and Share framework were used to guide the development
   of the Healthy Hearts program. The development process consisted of 2
   phases. In phase 1, the research team met to discuss implementing the
   M-PAC framework to adopt an existing web-based hypertension prevention
   program to a mobile app. The app was developed using a no-code app
   development platform, Pathverse (Pathverse Inc), to help decrease
   overall development time. In phase 2, we created a prototype and
   conducted usability testing to evaluate lesson 1 of the Healthy Hearts
   program to further enhance the user experience. We used semistructured
   interviews and the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire to evaluate
   program acceptability and usability. Results: Intervention development
   among the research team successfully created an 8-week
   financial-incentive hypertension education program for adults aged 40-65
   years who did not currently meet the Canadian Physical Activity
   Guidelines (<150 minutes of moderate to vigorous PA per week). This
   program lasted 8 weeks and comprised 25 lessons guided by the M-PAC
   framework. The program used various behavior change techniques to
   further support PA adherence. Usability testing of the first lesson was
   successful, with 6 participants recruited for 2 rounds of testing.
   Feedback was gathered to enhance the content, layout, and design of the
   Healthy Hearts program to prepare the mHealth program for feasibility
   testing. Results of round 1 of usability testing suggested that the
   content delivered in the lessons was long. Therefore, the content was
   divided into multiple lessons before round 2 of usability testing, where
   feedback was only on design preferences. A minimum viable product was
   created with these results. Conclusions: The iterative development
   process and the usability assessments suggested by the Integrate,
   Design, Assess, and Share framework enabled participants to provide
   valuable feedback on the content, design, and layout of the program
   before advancing to feasibility testing. Furthermore, the use of the
   ``no-code{''} app development tool enabled our team to rapidly make
   changes to the app based on user feedback during the iterative design
   process.},

Title = {Using MATLAB software with Tomcat server and Java platform for remote
   image analysis in pathology},

   Virtual Microscopy, Vilnius, LITHUANIA, JUL 01-03, 2010},
Abstract = {Background: The Matlab software is a one of the most advanced
   development tool for application in engineering practice. From our point
   of view the most important is the image processing toolbox, offering
   many built-in functions, including mathematical morphology, and
   implementation of a many artificial neural networks as AI. It is very
   popular platform for creation of the specialized program for image
   analysis, also in pathology. Based on the latest version of Matlab
   Builder Java toolbox, it is possible to create the software, serving as
   a remote system for image analysis in pathology via internet
   communication. The internet platform can be realized based on Java
   Servlet Pages with Tomcat server as servlet container.
   Methods: In presented software implementation we propose remote image
   analysis realized by Matlab algorithms. These algorithms can be compiled
   to executable jar file with the help of Matlab Builder Java toolbox. The
   Matlab function must be declared with the set of input data, output
   structure with numerical results and Matlab web figure. Any function
   prepared in that manner can be used as a Java function in Java Servlet
   Pages (JSP). The graphical user interface providing the input data and
   displaying the results (also in graphical form) must be implemented in
   JSP. Additionally the data storage to database can be implemented within
   algorithm written in Matlab with the help of Matlab Database Toolbox
   directly with the image processing. The complete JSP page can be run by
   Tomcat server.
   Results: The proposed tool for remote image analysis was tested on the
   Computerized Analysis of Medical Images (CAMI) software developed by
   author. The user provides image and case information (diagnosis,
   staining, image parameter etc.). When analysis is initialized, input
   data with image are sent to servlet on Tomcat. When analysis is done,
   client obtains the graphical results as an image with marked recognized
   cells and also the quantitative output. Additionally, the results are
   stored in a server database. The internet platform was tested on PC
   Intel Core2 Duo T9600 2.8GHz 4GB RAM server with 768x576 pixel size,
   1.28Mb tiff format images reffering to meningioma tumour (x400,
   Ki-67/MIB-1). The time consumption was as following: at analysis by
   CAMI, locally on a server -3.5 seconds, at remote analysis -26 seconds,
   from which 22 seconds were used for data transfer via internet
   connection. At jpg format image (102 Kb) the consumption time was
   reduced to 14 seconds.
   Conclusions: The results have confirmed that designed remote platform
   can be useful for pathology image analysis. The time consumption is
   depended mainly on the image size and speed of the internet connections.
   The presented implementation can be used for many types of analysis at
   different staining, tissue, morphometry},

Title = {Data-Driven Onboard Inter-Turn Short Circuit Fault Diagnosis for
   Electric Vehicles by Using Real-Time Simulation Environment},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {145447-145466},
Abstract = {Various fault detection methods, particularly focused on onboard
   Condition-Based Monitoring (CBM) in Electrical Machines and Drives
   (EMDs), face limitations such as sensitivity to load variations, slow
   fault detection, and the absence of fully automated solutions. AI and
   Data-Driven methods offer flexible alternatives, utilizing historical
   data for pattern and anomaly identification. Among Electrical Signature
   Analysis techniques for electrical motor diagnostics, the Space Vector
   Theory (SVT) is extensively used, while Park's Vector based diagnostic
   solutions lack real-time Inter-Turn Short Circuit (ITSC) fault severity
   assessment, with available techniques often limited to binary
   classifiers. Implementing AI with SVT for real-time Electric Vehicle
   (EV) use is underdeveloped, hindered by data scarcity and diverse
   dataset collection challenges. Real-time simulation, accurate fault
   modeling, and hardware limitations pose challenges, especially for
   embedding AI models into processors. To achieve intelligent onboard
   diagnosis for ITSC fault severity in this paper, a multi-modal approach
   model is proposed, employing MobileNetV2 to classify Park's Vector
   trajectories based on the fault features related to the number of
   shorted turns. Performance assessments encompass both the standard
   MobileNetV2 and the proposed multi-modal approach model across various
   fault severity levels. Furthermore, to address the challenge of limited
   data availability, an accelerated real-time AI development environment
   is designed using an FPGA to generate synthetic fault pattern datasets,
   aligning with the standards of the Electric Vehicle industry. For
   modeling PMSM with ITSC faults, a fault circuit model is employed. The
   dataset of 900 Park's Vector trajectory images is automatically
   generated by varying the torque request from 10 to 100 Nm with a 10 Nm
   resolution. At each torque operating point, the motor currents are
   recorded by adjusting the number of shorted turns. Simulation results
   confirm the outstanding performance of MobileNetV2 in binary
   classification, achieving an accuracy of 99.26 \%. In case of 5-class
   ITSC fault severity classification, the prediction accuracy reaches only
   72.55 \%. The here proposed multi-modal MobileNetV2 model excels,
   achieving a remarkable accuracy of 99.163 \% in the 3-class fault
   severity classification and 84.907 \% in the 5-class classification.
   These results support the superiority of the proposed multi-modal
   MobileNetV2 model, which is trained on the generated rich dataset. It
   outperforms existing Park's Vector Analysis based ITSC fault detection
   methods, particularly in early ITSC fault detection as it can detect
   faults from 6 shorted turns. Additionally, it allows for online fault
   severity assessment during transient operation and meets stringent
   requirements for onboard applications. Altogether, the results of
   investigations prove the presence and extractability of fine detail
   information in Park's Vector trajectories, for assessing ITSC fault
   severity. This contributes to a deeper understanding and analysis of
   faults in electrical motors through the use of Park's Vector
   trajectories.},

Title = {WikiBuild: A New Application to Support Patient and Health Care
   Professional Involvement in the Development of Patient Support Tools},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {Active patient and public involvement as partners in their own health
   care and in the development of health services is key to achieving a
   health care system that is responsive to patients' needs and values. It
   promotes better use of the health care system, and improves health
   outcomes, quality of life and patient satisfaction. By involving
   patients and health care professionals as partners in the creation and
   updating of patient health support tools, wikis-highly accessible,
   interactive vehicles of communication-have the potential to empower
   users to implement these support tools in daily life. Acknowledging the
   potential of wikis, and recognizing that they capitalize on the free and
   open access to information, scientists, opinion leaders and patient
   advocates have suggested that wikis could help decision-making
   constituencies improve the delivery of health care. They might also
   decrease its cost and improve access to knowledge within developing
   countries. However, little is known about the efficacy of wikis in
   helping to attain these goals. There is also a need to know more about
   the intention of patients and health care workers to use wikis, in what
   circumstances and what factors will influence their use of wikis. In
   this issue of the Journal of Medical Internet Research, Gupta et al
   describe how they developed and tested a new wiki-inspired application
   to improve asthma care. The researchers involved patients with asthma,
   primary care physicians, pulmonologists and certified asthma educators
   in the construction of an asthma action plan. Their paper-entitled
   ``WikiBuild: a new online collaboration process for multistakeholder
   tool development and consensus building{''}-is the first description of
   a wiki-inspired technology built to involve patients and health care
   professionals in the development of a patient support tool. This
   innovative study has made important contributions toward how wikis could
   be generalized to involve multiple stakeholders in the development of
   other knowledge translation tools such as clinical practice guidelines
   or decision aids. More specifically, Gupta et al have uncovered
   potential action mechanisms toward increasing usage of these tools by
   patients and health care professionals. These are decreasing
   hierarchical influences, increasing usability and adapting a tool to
   local context. More research is now needed to determine if the use of
   the resulting wiki-developed plan will actually be higher than a plan
   developed using other methods. Furthermore, there is also a need to
   assess the intention of participants to continue using wiki-based
   processes on an ongoing basis. It is in this dynamic and continuous
   retroaction loop that the support tool users-both patients and health
   care professionals-can adapt and improve the product after its real-life
   shortcomings are revealed and as new evidence becomes available. As
   such, a wiki would be more than a simple patient support development
   tool, but could also become a dynamic and interactive repository and
   delivery tool that would facilitate ongoing and sustainable patient and
   professional engagement.},

Title = {Marketing Model of Tourism Enterprises Based on New Media Environment},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUL 11},
Abstract = {New media is a scientific and technological product under the background
   of the new era, and now new media technology has been widely used in all
   aspects of social development, and it has spawned the arrival of the new
   media era. In the new media environment, the survival and development
   environment faced by enterprises have undergone earth-shaking changes;
   if you still follow the traditional marketing methods, it will not only
   reduce the effectiveness of marketing but also because of the deviation
   from the development requirements of the times be eliminated, bringing
   threats to the survival and development of enterprises. The development
   of new media, represented by the Internet and mobile phones, has brought
   great changes to various industries in the world including tourism. The
   market size of the travel network is expanding, and online sales are
   soaring. At the same time, all kinds of tourism organizations often have
   blind optimism in the construction of tourism networks and lack of
   reasonable application means, so that tourism network marketing is far
   from exerting its potential in reality; on the one hand, it cannot
   provide transaction services that satisfy both supply and demand; on the
   other hand, it also affects the economic benefits of tourism
   organizations. Compared with the rapid development of the tourism media
   industry, the theoretical research related to the actual situation lags
   significantly. Although the number of related studies at home and abroad
   is increasing, most of them stay at the level of explanation and
   introduction, and the analysis of the tourism industry chain is not
   enough. The breadth and depth of the study are sorely lacking. The
   future letter needs to summarize the successes and failures of the
   development of the tourism media industry from a theoretical height and
   carry out theoretical improvement to guide practice, and it also needs
   to strengthen forward-looking research, summarize the laws and models,
   and put forward practical implementation plans to improve the overall
   development level of the tourism and media industry. Aiming at the
   problem of new media marketing strategy in shopping tourism scenic
   spots, this paper applies descriptive research, questionnaire survey,
   statistical processing, mathematical model, and other research methods
   to analyze the characteristics of new media such as prominence of
   personalization, increased audience selectivity, and diversified forms
   of expression presented by new media compared with traditional media, as
   well as the differences between the two in terms of communication
   status, dominant state, and audience state. 4I Marketing theory is
   applied to new media marketing, the changes in the marketing environment
   and marketing needs under the background of new media, and the extensive
   impact of these changes on the marketing mix strategy; the basic
   strategies and expected effects of new media marketing of tourism
   enterprises are studied from the aspects of product, price, channel, and
   promotion; the IPA model is constructed, and the empirical analysis of
   the shopping tourist attractions of Changshu Garment City in China is
   carried out. rough the research of this paper, in theory, the
   understanding of new media marketing is enriched, and in fact, it
   provides guidance for optimizing the new media marketing strategy of
   tourist attractions.},

Title = {Chronotherapy versus conventional statins therapy for the treatment of
   hyperlipidaemia},
Journal = {COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {Background
   Elevated levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein play an
   important role in the development of atheromas and, therefore, in
   cardiovascular diseases. Cholesterol biosynthesis follows a circadian
   rhythm and is principally produced at night (between 12: 00 am and 6: 00
   am). The adjustment of hypolipaemic therapy to biologic rhythms is known
   as chronotherapy. Chronotherapy is based on the idea that medication can
   have different effects depending on the hour at which it is taken.
   Statins are one of the most widely used drugs for the prevention of
   cardiovascular events. In usual clinical practice, statins are
   administered once per day without specifying the time when they should
   be taken. It is unknown whether the timing of statin administration is
   important for clinical outcomes.
   Objectives
   To critically evaluate and analyse the evidence available from
   randomised controlled trials regarding the effects of chronotherapy on
   the effectiveness and safety of treating hyperlipidaemia with statins.
   Search methods
   We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, ProQuest Health \&
   Medical Complete, OpenSIGLE, Web of Science Conference Proceedings, and
   various other resources including clinical trials registers up to
   November 2015. We also searched the reference lists of relevant reviews
   for eligible studies.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), enrolling people with
   primary or secondary hyperlipidaemia. To be included, trials must have
   compared any chronotherapeutic lipid-lowering regimen with statins and
   any other statin lipid-lowering regimen not based on chronotherapy. We
   considered any type and dosage of statin as eligible, as long as the
   control and experimental arms differed only in the timing of the
   administration of the same statin. Quasi-randomised studies were
   excluded.
   Data collection and analysis
   We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We
   extracted the key data from studies in relation to participants,
   interventions, and outcomes for safety and efficacy. We calculated odds
   ratios (OR) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) for
   continuous data with 95\% confidence intervals (CI). Using the GRADE
   approach, we assessed the quality of the evidence and we used the
   GRADEproGuideline Development Tool to import data from Review Manager to
   create ` Summary of findings' tables.
   Main results
   This review includes eight RCTs (767 participants analysed in morning
   and evening arms). The trials used different lipid-lowering regimens
   with statins (lovastatin: two trials; simvastatin: three trials;
   fluvastatin: two trials; pravastatin: one trial). All trials compared
   the effects between morning and evening statin administration. Trial
   length ranged from four to 14 weeks. We found a high risk of bias in the
   domain of selective reporting in three trials and in the domain of
   incomplete outcome data in one trial of the eight trials included. None
   of the studies included were judged to be at low risk of bias.
   None of the included RCTs reported data on cardiovascular mortality,
   cardiovascular morbidity, incidence of cardiovascular events, or deaths
   from any cause. Pooled results showed no evidence of a difference in
   total cholesterol (MD 4.33, 95\% CI -1.36 to 10.01), 514 participants,
   five trials, mean follow-up 9 weeks, low-quality evidence), low-density
   lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (MD 4.85 mg/dL, 95\% CI -0.87 to
   10.57, 473 participants, five trials, mean follow-up 9 weeks,
   low-quality evidence), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (MD
   0.54, 95\% CI -1.08 to 2.17, 514 participants, five trials, mean
   follow-up 9 weeks, low-quality evidence) or triglycerides (MD -8.91,
   95\% CI -22 to 4.17, 510 participants, five trials, mean follow-up 9
   weeks, low-quality evidence) between morning and evening statin
   administration.
   With regard to safety outcomes, five trials (556 participants) reported
   adverse events. Pooled analysis found no differences in statins adverse
   events between morning and evening intake (OR 0.71, 95\% CI 0.44 to
   1.15, 556 participants, five trials, mean follow-up 9 weeks, low-quality
   evidence).
   Authors' conclusions
   Limited and low-quality evidence suggested that there were no
   differences between chronomodulated treatment with statins in people
   with hyperlipidaemia as compared to conventional treatment with statins,
   in terms of clinically relevant outcomes. Studies were short termand
   therefore did not report on our primary outcomes, cardiovascular
   clinical events or death. The review did not find differences in adverse
   events associated with statins between both regimens. Taking statins in
   the evening does not have an effect on the improvement of lipid levels
   with respect to morning administration. Further high-quality trials with
   longer-term follow-up are needed to confirm the results of this review.},
