## Program Behavior Analysis and Control for Online IDE

Link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6341572

Notes:

- this paper focuses on three problems of online ides:
  - wrong file operations: users may delete system files if allowed
  - banned method calling: users may execute malicious code if allowed
  - excessive resource consumption: one user may cause other users to have a worse experience by consuming an excessive amount of resources
- the first two problems seem irrelevant for the intended use-case of the ide but could be interesting in a container based development environment
- implemented ceclipse (client server architecture) which includes a program analysis part for the three problems mentioned above
