        "Abstract": "To develop good programming skills in C language, novices students must provide a lot of efforts in order to acquire experience and techniques of writing computer programs, they need to spend a respectable period of time doing practical activities, to start beginners must install and use a compiler or integrated development environment, without any assistance they are usually face a number of obstacles associated with this step. This paper introduces an online Web-Lab based system that provides a web integrated development environment (WIDE) for students doing practical programming activities and assignment in a distance learning. The proposed system provides students an editor for writing, editing, updating, compiling and executing their programming code source in the Web. The system is also interactive by introducing tools such Chat-Room, E-Mail, and Forum among learners and instructors interact. The results of using WIDE are very encouraging for enhancing novices students programming skills by allowing them learning and practicing on the web, for instructors to use the recorded information to track the learner's progress.",

        "Abstract": "Developing software for embedded systems may be a challenging task. Next to solid programming skills using the C language (and Assembly) elaborate know-how about the target controller and surrounding hardware is mandatory. Furthermore, setup of the required tooling (compiler infrastructure, debug interfaces, etc.) can be a cumbersome task, especially when supporting multiple different host operating systems. Especially for beginners, this tooling aspect can turn out as an intriguing problem. This paper presents a cloud based integrated development environment (Cloud IDE) for embedded systems based entirely on open-source solutions that has the potential to ease some of these burdens. In contrast to existing solutions it supports flashing and debugging of a target board attached to the local host computer whereas, the entire development takes place in a cloud environment.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain has become novel solutions for many traditional issues in computer science and finance. Recently, with the release of Libra blockchain from Facebook, the decentralized finance concepts have another huge development. However, there are already many different blockchain systems existing now and the development of blockchain systems have become more and more complicated since each kind of blockchain development environment will consume time to be built. To make the programming on different blockchain systems more easily, we propose a novel cloud-based solution, namely ChainIDE, for the development of blockchain-based smart contracts on multiple kinds of blockchain systems. With chainIDE, cross-chain developing of smart contracts on different blockchain systems can be easily done without any time consumed by building the environment. Based on the operation statistics in this paper, we served more than 310,000 compilations in the past 30 days which makes us the most popular cloud-based cross-chain development platform in the world.",

        "Abstract": "In practice, many people have to work together to develop and maintain a software system. However, the programmer's key tool, the Integrated Development Environment (IDE), is a solo-tool, serving to help individual programmers understand and modify the system. Such an IDE does not leverage the knowledge other team members may have of the design and implementation of the system. We propose to resolve this problem by exploring, experimentally, new ways of inferring knowledge from past IDE-interactions, and of maximizing collaboration among developers. Our approach, called Adinda, revolves around transforming the IDE into a set of integrated services, accessible via a web browser, and enriched with Web 2.0 technologies. Such services will not only help developers perform traditional IDE tasks, but also facilitate the required informal communication and collaboration needs of software development projects. In this paper, we report on our vision, approach and challenges for building Adinda, and initial results.",

        "Abstract": "The World Wide Web has become pervasive in many facets of our professional and personal lives over a decade. Today, another Internet revolution is emerging: Grid computing. While Web offers easy access to mostly static information via Hypertext, the Grid adds another fundamental layer to the Internet, by enabling direct access to and use of underlying resources, such as computers, storage, scientific instruments and experiments, sensors, applications, data and middleware services. This paper presents readers both a concrete introduction and a handy reference to web services in grid computing, first by explaining the foundations of this new breed of distributed services, and then by demonstrating quick ways to create services with .NET framework 4.5 and Visual Studio 2012 tools. Hence in this article, you will learn the concepts of the web services in grid computing and get practical advice on building and deploying web services using Visual Basic 2012.",

In this paper, the different facets of Web services are identified and a flexible approach to engineering complex Web services is adopted in the form of a proposed framework for the development of Web services. After the examination of its main constituent parts, it is argued that its full potential and that of Web service engineering in general, is realized through the gradual formation of a rich service grid offering value-added supporting functionality and therefore the main desirable properties of such a service grid are highlighted. Finally, the paper outlines a validation approach for the proposed framework and assembles important pointers for future work and concluding remarks.",

RIDE was developed based on Eclipse Theia – an open source web IDE framework. Despite being based on web technologies such as Node.JS, RIDE can not serve as a web application for multiple users simultaneously. The paper describes an approach for configuring a server environment and creating a host program that makes hosting RIDE as a public web application possible. It provides problem analysis, tools and frameworks survey, and implementation details. Among discussed technologies are Docker, Kubernetes, and Eclipse Che. For multi-user support and security reasons, an instance of RIDE runs in an independent Docker container for each client. The host program handles input connections, runs and stops Docker containers with RIDE. The described approach may be used for deploying other single-user applications in the cloud turning them into web-services.",

As various types of modeling rise and the intensity and frequency of discipline penetration are deepened and accelerate gradually, Matlab has gradually entered more people's field of vision. In order to simplify the programming environment and improve the convenience, a Matlab programming environment based on Web is proposed in this paper. Compared with the traditional Matlab programming environment, the main features of the system are that it does not need to deploy any development environment locally, and users can write and run Matlab code through the browser of mobile phone, tablet, computer; at the same time, the system also supports standard input, parameter input, and image output. Through the research and testing of the system, the programming environment has strong feasibility, excellent user experience, good concurrency and stability.",

        "Abstract": "RIDE is an integrated development environment (IDE) suited for the Reflex language, specifically designed for creating control algorithms for cyber-physical systems. RIDE is based on Eclipse Theia and a host program running independent instances for each user. However, it does not provide collaborative experience. Eclipse Theia is designed for single-user; therefore, collaborative programming is hampered by security and ease of use issues. This paper outlines a server program architecture to add collaborative abilities to otherwise single-user web applications. The suggested approach is application independent. It is applicable to other single-user applications, making it possible to deploy them in the cloud as web services. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the problem, as well as the tools and frameworks used for implementing this design with RIDE. This implementation makes use of Docker for containerization, Python and Flask for host program, Google Auth for user authentication, and SQLite for the database.",

        "Abstract": "Machine learning (ML) application development constitutes a complex process that requires developers to have considerable amount of programming and specialized technical skills. There is still a substantial barrier for researchers who do not possess the programming and technical skills to develop ML models that meets the needs of their specific fields of study. The typical ML model development workflow entails the installation of a set of software elements and a certain amount of code development. This paper introduces a browser-based ML application development tool that is geared towards the needs of researchers who have limited knowledge in programming. The tool allows the users to create a customized image classifier model based on the image sets that they provide. The tool provides a no-code workflow that enables users to create and test their ML models on a browser without downloading any software modules.",

        "Abstract": "While cloud-and web-based Integrated Development Environments (IDE) are used in practice and education for some time, these are mainly intended for classical web development. Support for enterprise platforms such as Java Enterprise Edition (EE) is typically lacking. However, in higher education, web-based cloud IDE are particularly useful in software development courses for non-computer science major students, since they could help to overcome the participants' limited IT skills. Thus, a respective easy-to-use web IDE is required. Therefore, in this paper a software platform for a web-based cloud IDE for educational purposes is proposed and evaluated, which in particular supports Java EE and is suitable for non-computer science majors. The platform was evaluated in a classroom experiment. The results indicate that it is useful and beneficial for the students, allowing the lecturer and the students to focus more on the actual learning objectives.",

Reflex has proved effective in industrial projects. But using Reflex is difficult due to the lack of IDE for Reflex programs. In this paper, we develop a cloud desktop IDE for the Reflex language - RIDE. Modularity is the main principle of RIDE architecture. It meets the needs of CPS software development process and allows extending the IDE functionality. Reflex IDE extensions may provide various functionalities, such as a graphical representation of the Reflex code, translators to other programming languages, debugging, and verification techniques.",

        "Abstract": "Software engineering tools and environments are migrating to the cloud, enabling more people to participate in programming from many more devices. To study this phenomenon in detail, we designed, implemented and deployed Touch Develop (url www.touchdevelop.com), a cloud-based integrated development environment (CIDE), which has been online for the past three years. Touch Develop combines a cross-platform browser-based IDE for the creation of mobile cloud apps, an online programmer/user community, and an app store. A central feature of Touch Develop is to track all program edits, versions, runtime information, bugs, as well user comments, questions and feedback in a single cloud-based repository that is available publicly via Web APIs. In this paper, we examine a key feature of Touch Develop that should be relevant to others creating CIDEs, namely the seamless integration of replicated workspaces, simplified version control and app publishing. An analysis of the Touch Develop repository shows that this combination of capabilities allows users to easily create new versions of apps from existing apps, make changes to other users' apps, and share their results from a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets and traditional PCs.",

This paper proposed the Online Code Editor that was created for programmers or developers who want to write programs without any platform requirements or without any specific physical computers. It bases on web application running on the Private cloud computing. The features of the editor are performed on web programming languages, e.g. HTML, PHP, CSS, and JavaScript. The editor is able to isolate programming languages by highlighting syntax of programs. Users can create new projects and files, import and export files that they want on a server. Moreover, Save, Auto save, Delete, and etc. are the additional functions of the editor. In this research of the text editor development, the open source software called, “Ace” was used for some functions such as Undo, Redo, and Syntax highlight. The experimental results indicated that the proposed editor can be practically used on Private cloud computing. Moreover, the comparison of the features among the proposed editor running on Private cloud, Notepad++, and EditPlus which running on personal computers, was summarized.",

        "Abstract": "Web services provide an instantiation of the loosely coupled service–oriented architecture and facilitate the process of enterprise application integration by encapsulating information, software, and other resources. However, to exploit the true potential of web services, it is critical to develop technologies and tools for composing new services from existing ones. While numerous composition approaches have been developed in the past, very little has been done towards tooling. What is clearly lacking is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to ease the process of composition, thereby reducing development time and integration efforts. In this paper, we build on our previous work on service composition, and present an IDE for end–to–end composition of web services. We elaborate on the design of the IDE, describe its integration with existing technologies, and discuss its usability based on the findings of a user survey.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents an approach of static and dynamic visualizations synchronized along with source code in a web-based programming environment, JavelinaCode. Using JavelinaCode, student programmers can write Java programs directly in a frontend web browser without any software or plug-in installation. They are provided with a view of the static state of a Java program in UML class diagrams and the dynamic run-time state of the program by stepping forwards and backwards through program execution. A case study has revealed that our approach is useful, in particular, to trace and detect an object flow anomaly caused by method overriding and polymorphism. A preliminary comparison test result also has shown that through our web-based platform-independent environment, student programmers are freed from concern with continuous version changes and evolutions of the Java language, plug-ins, and operating systems.",

        "Abstract": "On most PaaS (Platform as a Service) systems, applications that are developed on a server are executed on the same server. As such, portability of these applications is not considered as is the case with a WebOS. This paper proposes a Web-based Software Development Environment (WSDE) for developing applications. The WSDE provides a web-based development environment for software applications that can be executed on a server, local and/or embedded machine. Thus, it is unnecessary for each developer to install software for developing applications on the local system or to set the environment variables of the local system. With the WSDE, developers can use the same environment via a Web browser anytime, anywhere. Moreover, this paper proposes a renewable system for embedded systems. To develop application programs for embedded systems, application developers have to prepare a software development environment for each target embedded system. The WSDE allows software developers to develop software applications on a server using a virtual machine.",

In order to program in the cloud, lots of IDEs are also moved into the cloud at recent years. Although online IDE can bring developers a lot of convenience for their developing process, some tough problems are still less touched. This paper summarized three main kinds of actual problems from three aspects (Function implementation, Security guarantee, Advanced utilization) encountered when using the online IDE, and proposed three solutions (Services composition, Program behavior analysis, Program behavior mining) to handle these according problems. Finally, this paper introduce a real online IDE (CEclipse) developed by our research group and apply the three solutions in this online IDE.",

        "Abstract": "In software development, IDE services are used to assist developers in programming tasks. In dynamic web applications, however, since the client-side code is embedded in the server-side program as string literals, providing IDE services for such embedded code is challenging. We introduce Varis, a tool that provides services on the embedded client-side code. We perform symbolic execution on a PHP program to approximate its output and parse it into a VarDOM that compactly represents all its DOM variations. Using the VarDOM, we implement various types of IDE services for embedded client code including syntax highlighting, code completion, and 'find declaration'.",

        "Abstract": "Many universities choose online courses instead of in-person during the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the limitations of online courses is that it is difficult to perform teacher-student interactions in online teaching environments. Especially in online programming courses, it is hard to find an appropriate approach to remotely guide students when they have trouble conducting program code. This paper presents a lightweight IDE named CodeHelper integrated with an online judge that allows the instructor or the teaching assistant (TA) to help students in a form of online pair programming. Students can share their code with the instructor or the TA in a sandbox programming environment generated by CodeHelper, and the instructor or the TA can guide students by marking the mistakes in the sandbox. CodeHelper allows real-time pair programming for both sides, which can reduce the time and the cost of distance learning. Besides, the source code shared in the sandbox can also be compiled for syntax check, executed with a user-defined input, and submitted to the online judge for automated assessment, which can let students check the correctness of their programs once their troubles have been solved. It is efficient to use CodeHelper for mentoring students in online programming courses.",

        "Abstract": "Botnets are an ongoing threat to the cyber world and can be utilized to carry out DDoS attacks of high magnitude. From the botmaster's perspective, there is a constant need for deploying more effective botnets and discovering new ways to bolster their bot ranks. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) have been essential for software developers to write and compile source code. The increasing need for remote work and collaborative workspaces have led to the IDE-as-a-service paradigm that offers online code editing and compilation with multiple language support. In this paper, we show that a multitude of online IDEs do not run control checks on the user code and can be therefore lever-aged by a botnet. We examine the concept of uncontrolled execution environments and present a proof of concept to show how uncontrolled online-IDEs can be weaponized to perform large-scale attacks by a botnet. Overall, we detect a total of 719 online-IDEs with uncontrolled execution environments and limited sandboxing. Lastly, as ethical disclosure, we inform the IDE developers and service providers of the vulnerabilities and propose countermeasures.",

However, there is little research of how developers behave when interacting with these environments. Aims: To develop empirical knowledge about how developers behave when interacting with cloud based IDEs to deal with programming tasks at various difficulty levels. Method: We conducted a user study using a cloud based IDE, JazzHub. We collected and coded session trace data, self-reported effort and frustration levels, and screen recordings. Results: We built a Markov activity transition model that describes the transitions among common development activities such as coding, debugging, and searching for information. It also captures extended interactions with remote resources. We correlated activity transition with different code growth trajectories. Conclusion: The findings are an early step toward realizing the potential for enhanced interactions in cloud based IDEs. Our study provides empirical evidence that may inspire the future evolution of cloud based IDE designs and features.",

Besides the usual program development facilities such as compiling and debugging, the environment also provides multimedia features for presentation of program output, including audio, interactive graphics, interactive I/O, and HTML forms. The interactive graphics feature plots one or more user-defined functions and includes a graphical implementation of Newton's method for finding a zero given a function and its derivative. The audio feature plays 8 KHz. sampled sound which may be generated by a program directly or by performing signal processing on an input file. The HTML output feature allows students in advanced courses to develop specialized web-based sub- environments. The environment can be customized to provide different prototype files for each subproject of multiple courses and also different files for each student.",

        "Abstract": "Web-based IDEs are more and more popular because developers can create or modify software artifacts in the browser without need to install any local development tool and spend valuable development time on system setup and maintenance. For those development tasks using a Web-based IDE, such as configuring programming context and batch test etc., some are frequent and repetitive because they are similar from project to project. Automating the repetitive tasks on Web-based IDEs, regardless of their complexity, would reduce the amount of work that developers must perform to complete the tasks, which would improve the development efficiency of Web applications. In this paper, we put forward a user-friendly approach to automating repetitive tasks on existing Web-based IDEs. The key to the approach is to extend the basic Web-based capture-replay technique with editable and reusable features, which are necessary for automation because some operations are redundant, as well as developers should recognize and define repetitive tasks. Moreover, we develop a supporting tool for the approach. In the case study, we introduce how the approach is used to support automating repetitive tasks on Web-based IDEs. Case studies verify that the approach can improve the development efficiency very well.",

SERVE enables users to focus on logic designs, without facing the hassle of setting up FPGA tools and development environment. Users can write and simulate hardware logic in the cloud IDE and then generate bitstream files through a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline. Finally, the bitstream files are deployed on an FPGA board. A great amount of testbenches will be executed to ensure the correctness of the hardware logic. We will demo a workflow of modifying a RISC- V processor and getting the design change quickly evaluated using SERVE.",

        "Abstract": "Event-driven programming is a popular methodology for the development of resource-constrained embedded systems. While it is a natural abstraction for applications that interface with the physical world, the disadvantage is that the control flow of a program is hidden in the maze of event handlers and call-back functions. TinyOS is a representative event-driven operating system, designed for wireless sensor networks, featuring a component-based architecture that promotes code reuse. In this paper, we present a web-based model-driven graphical design environment for TinyOS that visualizes the component hierarchy of an application, and captures its event-based scheduling mechanism. In contrast with existing visual environments, our representation explicitly captures the control flow of the application through events and commands, which makes it easier to understand the program logic than studying the source code. The design environment supports two-way code generation: mapping the visual representation to TinyOS source code, as well as building visual models from existing sources.",

        "Abstract": "The focus in computing today has shifted from the desktop environment to the Web. Tasks that were previously performed exclusively on desktop can now be done in Web environment. Web tools have the same features as their desktop counterparts and offer additional specific benefits. These tools do not need to be installed or updated nor are restricted to individual computer or operating system yet available anytime and from any location. Work can be done in collaboration and result can be easily shared. The same applies to programming which indicates that complete process of software development can now be done without the use of traditional desktop tools. The basic tool used in software development is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) which allows writing, translating and testing programs. It is also commonly used in a learning programming process. Replacing desktop IDE with its Web equivalent in learning programming has potential to improve that process and bring some advantages related to new environment. This paper presents the use of AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) method for multi-criteria decision-making related to choosing the most appropriate Web IDE for learning programming and reports experience of its use in introductory programming course.",

        "Abstract": "Collaborative modelling has become a necessity when developing a complex system or in a team of modellers with a diverse set of expertise. Textual notations have a long history in software engineering because of their fast editing style, simple usage, and scalability. Therefore, we propose a novel collaborative modelling framework for the graphical User Requirements Notation (URN) which we call tColab. It uses the text-based TGRL (Textual Goal-oriented Requirement Language) to build URN goal models and then automatically generates corresponding graphical models. This framework is based on the architecture of Eclipse Che and Theia. On one side, Theia provides support for LSP (Language Server Protocol) so that textual models can be built and their corresponding graphical models can be generated in a browser IDE (Integrated Development Environment). On the other hand, Eclipse Che adds support for collaboration where multiple modellers can contribute to building the textual models in an online collaborative manner. This initiative aims to replace the jUCMNAV tool, which is the most comprehensive URN modelling tool to date but only supports a single user.",

Forty eight students forming 24 two-member groups in class used the IDE to interact and write source code required by the project. All collaborative and programming activities performed by students were recorded by IDEOL. The results of the study shows that students tend to postpone their programming work until the submission dates. This study also provides an approach to designing and executing an extended programming exercises, which receives high student satisfaction. Our results imply that IDEOL is a useful environment for students to collaborate, learn, and practice programming to improve their learning satisfaction. In addition, as students tend to procrastinate, IDEOL is a useful tool to facilitate, monitor, and report student progress in extended programming exercises.",

        "Abstract": "In programming courses, students are often asked to work in groups to write multiple programs. The existing Integrated Development Environments (IDE), however, do not encourage concurrent interactions among student programmers. Students often encounter difficulties in collaborative activities, sharing resources, reviewing code and discussing ideas, especially when the group cannot reach a common arrangement for face-to-face meetings at a convenient time and place. We propose to resolve this problem by transforming the traditional IDE into Software as a Service on the Web, and integrating collaborative features in order to create an interactive and responsive environment, where real-time on-the-job guidance, communication and collaboration can be delivered. In this paper, we introduce a web-based IDE designed for this purpose, and show how it can be applied in programming courses.",

Although online IDE can bring developers a lot of convenience for developing process, it also suffers from some special challenges.

This paper summarized three main kinds of actual problems (Wrong file operations, Banned method calling, and Excessive resource consumption) encountered when using the online IDE, and proposed a program behavior analysis based solutions to control these problems adaptively. Finally, this paper demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed solutions by applying them in a real online IDE.",

This paper introduces a novel architecture for web-based development tools, employing a thin-client approach and scalable micro-service architecture, which holds significance in the era of web technologies. Central to this framework is a reactive document analysis algorithm, which is based on the declarative description of formal domain concepts and analysis rules. Several domain-specific languages have been drafted for domains such as industrial automation systems, based on IEC 61499, and biological knowledge structuring, to evaluate the proposed architecture. The results indicate the viability of integrating such an approach in future web-based development environments, thereby enhancing the ease and efficiency of conducting code analysis and editing tasks. Moreover, the architecture lays a foundation for the evolution of development tools aligned with modern web technologies.",

        "Abstract": "Cloud computing has become very popular in recent years. Various PaaS (Platform as a Service) systems for collaborative software development as well as DaaS (Desktop as a Service) systems for developing software have been proposed. Software development environments are categorized as one of four types: Client-side Development and Client-side Execution, Client-side Development and Server-side Execution, Server-side Development and Server-side Execution (SDSE), and Server-side Development Client-side Execution (SDCE). Most PaaS and DaaS systems assume that applications are developed on a server and executed on the same server. As such, portability of these applications is not considered. In order to improve the portability of the developed software and establish efficiency in the development environment, we propose SDCE and SDSE environments. The SDCE environment provides a Web-based software development environment for graphical user interface applications that can be executed on a local machine, while the SDSE environment provides a Web-based interactive application execution environment for console user interface applications that can be executed on the server.",

It is seamlessly integrated by Ch computing environment, Web server and some compiler/interpreter. It uses CGI programs as middleware for connecting various software tools. Ch computing environment is a complete C interpreter. As execution engine of C/C++ script, it achieves to run CGI programs. CGI stores and compiles these programs which are from the Web forms, and returns results to the Web browser. The networked programming environment uses HTTP protocol to transport data, and achieves multi-user sharing the environment to debug program. Experimental results show that the simulation environment is feasible, with sharing and platform-independent characteristics.",

        "Abstract": "Asynchronous and asynchronous integrated multimedia conferencing system ASSIST aims for corresponding to both of realtime conferences and non-realtime conferences. Especially, it is designed for effective information sharing by storing realtime conferencing information including multimedia information such as video and audio, and by making relation to conferencing items and information for asynchronous groupware tools such as schedule/task management, e-mail, and BBS. It is significant to construct efficient development environment for ASSIST, because it requires much effort to build this kind of systems each time in compliance with various purposes or display devices. We have designed a development environment for it and developed the prototype. The prototype system is currently focused on the implementation of facilities for asynchronous type groupware, and it makes developers possible to display tables of databases with sortable links for each field into Web browser by writing only a few line statements. In addition, we have considered integration methods for asynchronous and synchronous type Web-based groupware, applying architecture of we b-based slide sharing tool which we have already implemented. In this paper, we describe the design of a development environment for Web-based asynchronous and synchronous integrated groupware systems.",

Based on a programmable, extensible and dynamical HTTP server (A. Riva and M.

The general idea is that, in addition to specifying the domain knowledge used by the application, the developer should include information on the structure of the system itself in the knowledge base. Using this information, LISPWEB is able to automatically generate a large part of the application and of the high level entities appearing in the user interface: hypertext links, data entry forms, object representations for output.",

Building software development environments that support truly dynamic extension capabilities to incorporate a wide range of additional facilities at run-time has proved to be a very challenging task. We describe a new approach using Web service components to support the dynamic discovery, integration and invocation of remote software tool facilities for JEdit, an open source integrated development environment. In this approach discrete software tool functionality is encapsulated in software \"toolets\", accessed as remote Web service-based components. These toolet services are registered and discovered, and then dynamically integrated and invoked from within the JEdit IDE as required. We describe the architecture of our approach, key design and implementation issues, and illustrate the feasibility of the approach with several prototype toolet components and results of their evaluation.",

Our previous system allows user to develop and execute software on a web-browser. But our previous system assumes standard PC to execute graphical user interface applications. The graphical user interface applications that are developed in our previous system cannot be executed on mobile devices such as smart phone and tablet.

This data, if opportunely captured and analyzed, can be useful to understand how developers head the coding activities and can suggest members of developers community how to improve their performances. This paper presents a framework allowing to generate event logs from cloud-based IDE. These event logs are then examined using a process mining technique to extract the developers' coding processes and compare them in the shared coding environment. The approach can be used to discover emergent and interesting developers' behavior. Thus, we compare the coding process extracted by developers with different skills. To validate our approach, we describe the results of a study in which we investigate the coding activities of forty students of an advanced Java programming course performing a given programming task-during four assignments. Results also prove that users with different performances possess distinct attitudes highlighting that the adopted process mining technique can be useful to comprehend how developers can improve their coding skills.",

        "Abstract": "Computer programming courses require a lot of practice. Nevertheless, the difficulties found when trying to install the computer programming environment used in the university courses prevent many students from practicing at home. Hence, they can only practice during the computer laboratory lessons, or when the laboratories are available for the students. This limitation negatively affects the learning process. In order to reduce this obstacle, we have replaced the conventional IDE used in our courses by a web-based IDE called Codeboard. Among other advantages, this environment has the ability to collect statistics about the number of accesses to the developed projects, the number of compilations and runs of the corresponding programs, and the number of global accesses per day. Thus, it enables teachers to monitor the activities of the students both in lectures and at home. After using this tool for a semester, in this paper we report the statistics that are collected when using Codeboard, the limitations we have found in this tool, and how they could be easily overcome in order to perform a better analysis. We also report on the results of this preliminary experience by comparing the results of three consecutive courses (taught by the same instructors and using the same materials) in order to evaluate the influence of Codeboard on the learning process.",

        "Abstract": "Along with the mobile Internet growing up, mobile terminal device are becoming more and more multiplicity and the application development are become more difficult. In this paper, we propose a cross-platform application development environment supported by cloud service. This development environment abstract hardware capability makes developers needn't consider the hardware of target device, and it can generates different platform applications which run on different devices and service application run on the cloud. The cloud has the ability to provide service to four kinds of mobile device operating system and four terminal devices. At last, we implement the prototype of the application development environment and a campus application based on cloud.",

        "Abstract": "Semantic Web Services are a search effort to automate the usage of Web services, a necessary component for the Semantic Web. Traditionally, Web service discovery depends on detail formal semantic descriptions of available services. Since a complete detailed service is not always feasible, the client software cannot select the best service offer for a given user goal only by using the static service descriptions. Dynamic discovery based on semantic description of services is an essential aspect of the Semantic Web Service integration process Some data needs to be obtained during run0time because not all data required for service discovery can always be included in service descriptions. This paper shows when and why complete semantic description is unfeasible and it defines the role and position of offer discovery. We propose an approach for offer discovery of semantic web services using OWL-S IDE during discovery process. We also present the algorithm, the implementation and some preliminary results.",

The focus of this work is on reporting a teaching and learning experience aimed at introducing the students to the culture of sustainability, by means of a project that utilizes a leading visual programming environment and web 2.0 technologies, and is suitable for a relatively large group. The key idea was to tell a story through a computational artifact, whose development requires critical and creative thinking, problem solving, communication and collaboration skills [6] as well as information literacy. This paper describes the pedagogical design of the activities, their objectives, class management issues, and the scaffolds to designing the animated story, to be implemented using a cutting edge, syntax-free visual language called Scratch. Both the humanistic and the scientific aspects were to be covered in each story about a selected topic in sustainability, in order to involve as much as possible of the teaching spectrum and create a truly interdisciplinary environment. The developed Scratch-based solution is also suitable for deployment on mobile devices using the App Inventor visual programming language.",

ROS is built on publish/subscribe messaging model that is different from Blue-Sky. To solve the problem, we extended Blue-Sky in order to handle publish/subscribe message from ROS to Blue-Sky. ROS-Blue-Sky proxy runs as a ROS node to collect the messaging data from roscore in order to monitor and trace the access data of the Blue-sky and ROS mixed environments. As a result of the proxy extension, we can conveniently use the ROS feature from Blue-Sky nodes, trace and monitor the Blue-Sky and ROS nodes, and visualize the status in a web browser with a low overhead of the proxy.",

        "Abstract": "Developers work in the IDE, but search online resources in the web browser. The separation of the working and search context often cause the ignorance of the working context during online search. Several tools have been proposed to integrate the web browser into the IDE so that developers can search and use online resources directly in the IDE. These tools enable only the shallow integration of the web browser and the IDE. Some tools allow the developer to augment search queries with program entities in the current snapshot of the code. In this paper, we present an in-IDE ambient search agent to bridge the separation of the developer's working context and search context. Our approach considers the developers' working context in the IDE as a time-series stream of programming event observed from the developer's interaction with the IDE over time. It supports the deeper integration of the working context in the entire search process from query formulation, custom search, to search results refinement and representation. We have implemented our ambient search agent and integrate it into the Eclipse IDE. We conducted a user study to evaluate our approach and the tool support. Our evaluation shows that our ambient search agent can better aid developers in searching and using online programming resources while working in the IDE.",

However, with the deepening of the application of platform environments, the problem of time lag in learning interaction in virtual classrooms has gradually been exposed. The traditional one-way collaborative education platform has been difficult to meet the demand for real-time interaction in smart classroom teaching. Based on this, the research was inspired by programming education and introduced a Web-based interactive programming environment. Through segmented programming technology, real-time interaction between teachers and students in the virtual classroom was realized, and animation media resources were finally generated and published to the learning network. middle. In the environment design, the study introduced four dimensions of environmental learning goals (entry skills, primitive skills, emotional skills and wisdom skills) to analyze learners, and based on the analysis results, a corresponding teaching case for the interactive programming environment system framework was designed, discuss how to use this framework to implement subject teaching ideas and practical methods to promote real-time interaction in virtual classrooms.",

        "Abstract": "Numerous learners require general and generic algorithmic thinking abilities regardless of the programming languages through activities to develop algorithms to solve problems. For example, Scratch is block-based programming often used in elementary and junior high schools. Therefore, several learners need a block-based programming environment that can increase their interest in programming and fosters algorithmic thinking as they implement and solve their problems. However, setting a task that does not require learners to take the initiative is challenging. Thus, an easy subject that several learners can handle is necessary to develop. This study proposes a block-based programming environment allowing novice learners to create web game pages regarding random numbers to promote algorithmic thinking. The proposed environment can be handled easily by learners who know how to use Scratch.",

In some fields it was difficult to conduct effective teaching and learning and one of this field was computer programming teaching. In the field of programming, the use of online compilers was seen as an important challenge. The use of online compilers was seen by some students as a solution (especially during pandemic lockdown) when they did not have a computer to install an IDE but used a tablet/smartphone simply connected to the Internet, or they founded difficult to install/configure different compilers. The aim of this paper is to study and explore online compilers by making a comparison between them. A sample of 10 online compilers that were fully or partially open-source was selected. The comparison of compilers was done in 2 aspects, the first in the services they provide and the second in their performance in executing programs. Finally, a ranking of the three best compilers is given based on comparisons of the two aspects.",

        "Abstract": "In computer science education, the programming environment is just as crucial as the classroom environment. Students must be provided with adequate tools for developing an understanding of computer science paradigms. These paradigms include object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. JavelinaCode is a web-based integrated development environment (IDE) for Java programming that provides students with both a static and dynamic visualization of code; the static structure of code at compile time and the dynamic execution of code at run time. The objective of this research is to present the differences between JavelinaCode and similar programming environment tools to demonstrate how JavelinaCode improves students' understanding of OOP concepts. Comparative analysis is conducted between JavelinaCode and programming environment tools, including BlueJ, Jeliot 3, AguiaJ, JIVE, and jGRASP. Each of these tools is evaluated on the basis of time constraints for download and installation, complexity of the download process and tool's interface, and the provision of static and dynamic visualizations. The results of the comparative analysis show that JavelinaCode provides students with a more effective tool for understanding OOP concepts than those considered. This is due to a simplified set up process and user interface and a better integrated set of visualizations. The combination of these factors contributes to a programming environment that emphasizes developing and running code.",

Some provide software development with visual notations without source code, while others support programming with visual aids. Our research supports Java programming along with static UML class diagrams and dynamic execution trace of program synchronized in a webbased programming environment - JaguarCode. It aims to help students better understand static structure and dynamic behavior of Java programs, and object-oriented design concepts. This paper reports on an initial evaluation of JaguarCode to investigate its effectiveness and user satisfaction through quantitative and qualitative experiments. The experimental results revealed that having both static and dynamic visualizations did positively impact the correctness of program understanding and tracing problems, and the visual representations did affect students' understanding on program execution of the problems to higher accuracy. It was also observed that students were satisfied with the aspects of those visualizations provided in JaguarCode.",

        "Abstract": "Autonomous smart sensor is a highly integrated turn-key device, operates independently and owns itself life cycle. Networked sensors exchange information with protocols; we designed an application-layer protocol named AgileSN making sensor nodes interoperable and interchangeable. AgileSN sensor node itself and captured data that protocol carried are self-descriptive, with these smart capabilities, sensor nodes can be automatically detected or searched by interested peers or sink nodes, and sensor data can be parsed dynamically on the fly without human intervention, made autonomous sensor nodes plug and play in the network world. Like WEB system, well accepted network protocol make networked sensors interchangeable and interoperable, universal sensor tools are possible to process sensed data. We have designed a component-based software tool for sensor application development. In this software environment, all application functionalities are realized through software components, each component is designed to finish a special task, like reading data from networked sensors, data processing, visual presentation, network or local file I/O, HMI, etc. sensor data is processed sequentially by several components through data flow. A component can operate in its own thread, carefully designed component makes the whole data processing flow operates in pipeline mode, greatly improve data processing throughput. Components and data routes can be created and destroyed at runtime, so the application system functionality is reconfigured. We apply the Petri Net tool to model components and the whole application system, investigate their function and performance, present a non-collision high-performance soft-bus for inter-component data transfer, investigate the hazard phenomenon that exists in a multi-input component, and propose technical means to eliminate it.",

We build an operator that constructs a weak Web community, according to the definition given in,starting from a seed of Web sites. The necessity of such an operator is derived from a problem arisen in the model developed in, in which some relevant concepts in automotive oriented ontology were not given a corresponding Web community. This fact -if not considered- can bring automatic ontology development to some non-correct results. In this work we define and analyze a new operator, called Com, with the tools furnished by the method of parametrization and we find that, given a seed S and the induced graph I(S), the community generated by our operator is monotonic with respect to clustering and is denser than the original graph I(S).",

As the result, teachers must have an extensive workload for assessing the programming skill of their students. In this paper, we develop an online C++ web integrated development environment (Web-IDE), where teachers can prepare a set of unit testing-based programming task templates, in which the unique task descriptions and unit tests are specifically generated and assigned for each student, dynamically. The proposed system is implemented in the cloud so that it can be accessed via web browsers on both PC and mobile devices. This allows students to learn to write code, compile, run, test, and grade their programming assignments without installing additional software. We also confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system through our preliminary experiments with a real computer programming classroom.",

        "Abstract": "In this chapter we elaborate the fundamentals of platform as a service (PaaS) and outline core components of a typical PaaS. We focus on a specific cloud-computing layer, which is called application platform as a service (aPaaS). Emergence of this layer raises several questions regarding the existence of traditional development environments, tools, and the viability of alternative ecosystems along with new positions in the market. It is this questioning that shows the need for making sense of what underpins the very idea of aPaaS and how the idea is manifested in the market, and finally what implications can be drawn for academics and practitioners We articulate basic approaches to aPaaS and discuss metadata aPaaS by using our industry experience as well as a review of recent studies on this subject. This leads to a concise comparison of leading PaaS solutions.",

This paper focuses on how to dynamic find, bind and invoke Geographic web services by Ontology Web Language for Services (OWL-S). The development of an OWL-S based web service is time consuming and error prone. The main reason is the lack of a integrated development environment. So, we build an integrated developing environment of Geographic semantic web services by using existing tools. This IDE can assist developers to develop Geographic semantic web services. In order to realize the applications of Geographic semantic web services in OWL-S IDE, an experimental system has been developed. In the system we generate Geographic Ontology and develop, publish, bind, find and invoke web services in distributed network.",

BST processes templates in the browser using a JavaScript-coded engine, providing significant performance improvements and making model-view separation a reality. However, it also has significant drawbacks. BST's dependence on JavaScript affects its accessibility and hides the delivered pages' content from search engines, hampering Web visibility. The authors confront this dilemma and propose a technique that lets BST be accessible and semantically crawlable, while preserving its advantages.",

It aims to provide a coder or a team of coders to create, manage, develop, compile, execute and share a complete or partial set of development projects on the web without having any development and associated tools. This is mainly achieved through developing a virtualized integrated development environment completely functional on a browser, a web server hosting the virtual machine environment, a set of web services to carry out the necessary communication and synchronization, and a developer portal as the focal point of the whole environment. In this paper we describe the main architecture, working, related issues and challenges of the system. We have tested this concept and architecture on developing projects for .NET platform with C# as the base language. We observe that such environments offer plenty of useful and charming features to the developers with the some burden and sacrifice of flexibility.",

Options are available to view fiks, edit source code, compile, run, run in debug mode, run with output plotted and displayed as a GIF image, display C preprocessor output, display generated assembly code, display optimized assembly code, and insert compiler error messages as comments into the source code. The environment is implemented using a combination of C code, peri, and shell scripts, and is freely available (open source). The source code of the environment itself can be used as examples in an advanced Unix/C programming or security course. The environment has been used successfully in both sophomore and senior-level C programming courses, a graduate Unix/C programming course (C and shell programming), and a senior/graduate computer communications security course (Java programming).",

        "Abstract": "We exploited the recent advances in Internet connectivity and Web technologies for building Web-based parallel programming environments (WPPEs) that facilitate the development and execution of parallel programs on remote high-performance computers. A Web browser running on the user's machine provides a user-friendly interface to server-site user accounts and allows the use of parallel computing platforms and software in a convenient manner. The user may create, edit, and execute files through this Web browser interface. This new Web-based client-server architecture has the potential of being used as a future front-end to high-performance computer systems. We discuss the design and implementation of several prototype WPPEs that are currently in use at the Northeast Parallel Architectures Center and the Cornell Theory Center. These initial prototypes support high-level parallel programming with Fortran 90 and High Performance Fortran (HPF), as well as explicit low-level programming with Message Passing Interface (MPI). We detail the lessons learned during the development process and outline the tradeoffs of various design choices in the realization of the design. We especially concentrate on providing server-site user accounts, mechanisms to access those accounts through the Web, and the Web-related system security issues.",

        "Abstract": "The engineering of software-intensive systems is supported by a variety of development tools. While development tools are traditionally desktop tools, they are more and more complemented and replaced by web-based development tools. The resulting blend of desktop and web-based tools is difficult to integrate into a seamless tool chain, which supports product development by data, control and presentation integration. Moreover, the construction of such tool chains is a significant engineering challenge. We propose an approach for the efficient, automated construction of tool chains, which integrate both web-based and desktop development tools; and provide a proof of concept of the approach in a case study. Our approach suggests that companies can selectively take advantage of hosted web-based development tools, while maintaining a seamless flow of integration with legacy desktop tools.",

        "Abstract": "A common practice for system testing of web-based applications is to perform the test cases through a web browser. These tests are often recorded and managed by a record and replay tool, such as Selenium IDE. Mining specifications from such tests can be very useful for understanding, verifying, and debugging the system under test. This paper presents an approach to mining a behavior specification from a Selenium IDE test suite such that (a) it captures the behavior of the tests at a high level of abstraction, (b) the behavior can be simulated, and (c) all the tests are completely reproducible from the specification. We first identify similar test actions through context-sensitive clustering so as to normalize the given Selenium IDE tests. Then, we mine patterns of test actions that represent meaningful functions and transform Selenium IDE tests into abstract tests, which are similar to the tests used in the existing model-mining techniques. From the abstract tests, we synthesize a high-level Petri net that captures both temporal constraints and data values. For evaluation purposes, we applied our approach to eight test suites of two real-world systems, Magento (an online shopping system being used by many live stores) and Amazon. Two of the test suites are for security testing, aiming at SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities. The result shows that our approach is effective in producing abstract yet executable specifications and reducing the complexity of the models.",

The isolated environment offered by the virtual space guarantees private work sessions, and multi-project activities can also be handled more easily and uniformly. The analysis of the teaching program presented below provides insight into the practical and appropriate solutions offered by the containerization process.

Selecting the right tool for Web development projects is becoming more important as enterprises move from static Web sites to more sophisticated interactive, secure, database-backed Web sites. The need to develop and deploy new Web applications in Internet time feeds the need to select the right tool for the project. In writing the article, each of the authors, as Web developers, began by picking their favorite tool and presenting its strengths and weaknesses. The tools presented were: Dreamweaver; Active Server Pages (ASP); Domino; Practical Extraction and Report Language (Perl). Then they challenged one another's lists of strengths and weaknesses. The sessions were sometimes passionate, but the authors managed to keep the discussions collegial and objective. The article reflects the best from those sessions.",

        "Abstract": "Team collaboration plays a key role in the success of any multi- user activity. Software engineering is a highly collaborative activity, where multiple developers and designers work together to solve a common problem. Meaningful and effective designer- developer collaboration improves the user experience, which can improve the chances of success for the project. Learning to program is another activity that can be implemented in a more collaborative way, students can learn in an active style by working with others. The growth of online classes, from small structured seminars to massive open online courses (MOOCs), and the isolation and impoverished learning experience some students report in these, points to an urgent need for tools that support remote pair programming in a distributed educational setting. In this paper, we describe Jimbo, a collaborative integrated development environment (IDE) that we believe is beneficial and effective in both aforementioned activities. Jimbo integrates many features that support better collaboration and communication between designers and developers, to bridge communication gaps and develop mutual understanding. These novel features can improve today’s CS education by bringing students closer to each other and their instructors as well as training them to collaborate which is consistent with current practices in software engineering.",

The use of xml at various levels of web services standards poses challenges to the above process. OWL-S is a service ontology and language, whose semantics are based on OWL. The semantics provided by OWL support greater automation of service selection, invocation, translation of message content between heterogeneous services, and service composition. The development and consumption of an OWL-S based web service is time consuming and error prone. OWL-S IDE assists developers in the semantic web service development, deployment and consumption processes. In order to achieve this the OWL-S IDE uses and extends existing web service tools. In this paper we will look in detail at the support for discovery for semantic web services. We also present the matching schemes, the implementation and the results of performance evaluation.",

        "Abstract": "Automatic detection of potential vulnerabilities is critical to promoting application security awareness. It should be performed at the earliest stages of the software development life cycle, the goal being to minimize risk, regardless of the progress of various vulnerability detection techniques in program code, both static and with deep learning, website application developers need to be assisted with notifications in real time, not waiting for the entire project to be completed directly from the IDE they use to stay focused. A common problem with vulnerability detection tools is annoying false-positive results and a lack of anticipation of new or unknown vulnerabilities. Therefore, in this work, we choose an approach to identify patterns and spots where there are potential vulnerabilities, termed security hotspots, so as not to detect vulnerabilities directly. We propose a rule-based plugin integrated into the IDE, which can detect eight security hotspots in the PHP web application program code based on the Laravel framework. We have implemented a proof-of-concept extension/plugin in the popular VSCode code editor (for this initial stage, only running on Windows OS), which is developed from PHP_CodeSniffer. Experiments on 10 Laravel-based projects presented an accuracy of 98.6% and an F1 score of 87.36%. When running, the extension takes 1 ms for the shortest number of tokens, 66 tokens, and 382 ms for the most extended tokens (4,051 tokens). The result shows that this plugin can help in code analysis on Laravel-based projects. Our approach can also effectively complement existing software security best practices.",

While our university provided access to computer programming languages and computer algebra systems, their installation on the students home computer often turned out to be a challenge and solving installation problems required an essential time of any freshmen course. To overcome these problems, the University of Stuttgart developed an online web-based programming tool, the VipLab, which allows hosting manifold computer programming systems from C to MATLAB while providing a simple online development environment to students. In the past, this programming lab was based on SCORM modules, following our own conventions defined in the LiLa project. However, SCORM has a couple of limitations, too, and the overall weak integration requires a needlessly complicated workflow for both lecturers creating exercises and students handing in homework solutions. In this work, we describe these limitations and how to overcome them by a solution specific to the Learning Management System (LMS) used at the University of Stuttgart.",

We focus on the issues that describe the integration of what we call a recipe (a description of a process related to the automatic deployment of applications) which is one aspect of systems design in service-oriented architecture and Cloud Computing. The context of our work is somehow orthogonal to what is done traditionally in the Cloud because we do not rely on virtual machines and there is no data center, in the common sense of the word. We also introduce our environment (IDE) for developing applications, designed for SlapOS. We demonstrate that from the initial deployment model we can take into account not only Web applications, B2B applications. . . but also grid applications; here a desktop grid middleware that constitutes a case study. Our first contribution focuses on the problems to automatically deploy and install a desktop grid application, on demand, with no administrator intervention. The second contribution focuses on the architectural design of an IDE for the SlapOS cloud and we illustrate our IDE's usage in the context of our use case.",

        "Abstract": "With the rapid development of object detection in deep learning (DL), applications on LiDAR point clouds have received much attention, such as autonomous driving. To verify the robustness of object detection models by testing, large amounts of diversifted annotated LiDAR point clouds are required to be used as test data. However, considering the sparseness of objects, the diversity of the existing point cloud dataset is limited by the number and types of objects. Therefore, it is important to generate diversifted point clouds by test data augmentation. In this paper, we propose a tool for LiDAR point cloud via test data augmentation, named TauLiM. A well-designed metamorphic relation (MR) [1] is proposed to augment point clouds while maintaining their physical characteristic of LiDAR. TauLiM is composed of three modules, namely point cloud configuration, coordinate filtering, and object insertion. To evaluate our tool, we employ experiments to compare the ability of testing between the existing dataset and the augmented one. The result shows that TauLiM can effectively augment diversified test data and test the object detection model. The video of TauLiM is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S6xpRbbhtQ and TauLiM can be used at http://1.13.193.98:2601/.",

        "Abstract": "This work addresses difficulty in web-supported programming. We conducted a lab study in which participants completed a programming task involving the use of the Java Swing/AWT API. We found that information about participant web accesses offered additional insight into the types of difficulties faced and how they could be detected. Difficulties that were not completely solved through web searches involved finding information on AWT/Swing tutorials, 2-D Graphics, Components, and Events, with 2-D Graphics causing the most problems. An existing algorithm to predict difficulty that mined various aspects of programming-environment actions detected more difficulties when it used an additional feature derived from the times when web pages were visited. This result is consistent with our observation that during certain difficulties, subjects had little interaction with the programming environment, they made more web visits during difficulty periods, and the new feature added information not available from features of the modified existing algorithm. The vast majority of difficulties, however, involved no web interaction and the new feature resulted in higher number of false positives, which is consistent with the high variance in web accesses during both non-difficulty and difficulty periods.",

        "Abstract": "Today programming requires to be able to code textually, but it also requires to be visual. Therefore, both of these have left visually impaired users in a very difficult position when it comes for learning and applying programming. There are tools that enable visually impaired users to use computers, but none of them has been specialized to aid the visually impaired users in various programming issues. The aim of this project is to develop a web application, especially for visually impaired people to facilitate to learn programming concepts. Designed solution is an application, based on speech recognition, semantic analysis, user interaction, and braille engine, which can use as a smart programming tool for visually impaired and differently abled people. It's a method of implementing a new way to help and motivate disable people, to use latest technologies in Information Technology and software engineering aspects. Here, researchers are focusing on Java language because it is considered as simple rather than other languages that programmers use today. This research helps to all visually impaired people, who are interested in coding, by teaching programming concepts and empower them to achieve the best future by giving programming theories simply with coding examples. Guide the user gradually by giving voice commands what to do next, and what can you try out according to their skills. It is expected to address the research gap in code generation according to voice commands.",

        "Abstract": "Biomedical engineering undergraduate students often underestimate the relevance of their courses as they hardly perceive their practical application in future professional development, resulting in a lack of interest, motivation, and engagement. This issue may be addressed by implementing practical or “hands-on” learning experiences that allow students to construct their knowledge and apply skills in real-world scenarios. This work proposes to create learning experiences supported by blended learning spaces, including traditional classrooms for direct instruction, daily-life scenarios for experiential learning enabled by wearable devices, and cloudbased programming environments for online collaborative work. The learning experience presented was implemented in a biomedical signals and systems course. Students used health wearables to record their physiological and behavioral signals in everyday scenarios and Google Collaboratory notebooks to analyze the collected data. The survey results applied to students suggest that technology-enabled blended learning spaces positively impact students’ perception of their learning experience. However, other potential benefits in learning derived from the use of technologies, such as increased student engagement and motivation and improved learning outcomes, require further investigation. This is particularly relevant given the monetary investment that scaling up this pedagogical approach would need.",

        "Abstract": "This paper describes designing and testing systems for inspection of web materials using a development environment simulated in software. This environment comprises five sub-systems: sensing, detection, characterization, validation and decision making. Given a specific inspection problem the system is customized by incorporating specific algorithms into each of the sub-systems. In order to illustrate the customization, the paper uses an example of inspection of a nonwoven material. The inspection objective is to quantify the randomness and homogeneity across the material. This task requires using statistical modeling to characterize texture. The paper discusses a theoretical approach based on a Poissonian model, its efficient implementation, and steps required to implement this procedure online.",

        "Abstract": "Embedded systems are ubiquitous in day to day life. Many of such systems are (1) numerous, (2) widely distributed over a large geographical area, and (3) often connected to a network. Software enhancements and bug-fixes to software running on such remotely deployed embedded systems might sometimes need to be done. The large numbers of systems that might need to be re-programmed, and/or the remote/inaccessible location of such systems often poses a major hurdle in the process. Several industrial solutions for re-programming distributed embedded systems do exist, viz., systems that use Remote Terminal Units, Programmable Logic Controllers or Programmable Automation Controllers. However, these systems are both complex and expensive. We propose a method to remotely program microcontroller-based distributed embedded systems. Such microcontroller-based solutions are the systems of choice for low-cost, high-volume, distributed embedded systems. Our approach is simple and is more suitable when a direct network connection to each of the distributed embedded systems is available. We use a simple web-based interface to write programs on a modern browser, and download the program onto a light-weight server attached to the remote embedded system. The server checks the code for errors and then updates the embedded system with the new version of the software. This solution is more amenable for low-cost systems and where each system is directly connected to the Internet. We believe that this model of reprogramming remote, connected embedded systems will help reduce the time to market, cost, maintenance effort and digital footprint of such systems.",

        "Abstract": "Most Information Technology (IT) organizations find that the maintenance of test and development environments is a major concern. This paper describes the significant benefits that can be attained when Systems Engineering (SE) and Cloud technology are combined to manage an organization's test and development environments. This combination provides tight governance around automated provisioning and decommissioning of environments allocated to projects. The benefits are: 1. Greatly reduced time to procure test servers/systems; 2. Tight scheduling and governance of test/dev systems; 3. Significantly reduced number of servers used for test; 4. Significantly reduced number of people needed for test; 5. Reduced dev/test server waste caused by lack of governance and management; 6. Significant energy savings during test and development phases. Systems Engineering methods and tools for cloud, such as Application Virtualization, can greatly enhance testing efficiency. Case studies, using private clouds with SE methods for test and development systems, are described in the paper.",

Despite the hype, maintaining these devices require high cost. Sometimes these devices may also get corrupted and also it require a lot of devices to store data. To reduce these problem, this research work maintains a cloud space, which can be accessed through a FTP login(admin), where user need to register/subscribe to access the cloud. After successful registration they will get links through mobile number, and then they need to login to upload their data. Here, the Data is protected by using ROTA algorithm. Also, the poposed research work provides bitcoin transaction as an additional feature. A private cloud has been created for storage and later it was implemented and created by using NetBeans IDE. The user can upload and download the data into the cloud by using FTP server. The bitcoin transaction shows the graph with different tokens entered by the user.",

Typically, tributaries are located deep within the jungle, and manual measurement is the norm. The research aims to develop a real-time remote monitoring system for measuring water depth and velocity. The system uses ultrasonic and water flow sensors to measure velocity and river depth. The data will be transmitted to the back-end software, including Arduino IDE and Node-RED, for data collection. The data is then stored in the cloud database InfluxDB for future use. The data can be set to be automatically deleted every 1 hour, 1 day, 1 month, or at other time intervals. The Grafana platform can produce an interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI), and the administrator can modify the visual dashboard using either their program code or existing features. It can then be made available to the general public as an observer for the online visual dashboard via the Uniform Resource Locator (URL).",

        "Abstract": "Interconnected computing systems in various forms will soon permeate our lives, realizing the Internet of Things (IoT) and letting us enjoy novel, enhanced services that promise to improve our everyday life. Nevertheless, this new reality introduces significant challenges in terms of performance, scaling, usability, and interoperability. Leveraging the benefits of service-oriented architectures (SOAs) can help alleviate many of the issues that developers, implementers, and users alike must face in the context of the IoT. Node.DPWS is a novel implementation of the Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS) based on the Node.js platform. It comprises the first set of DPWS libraries available to Node.js developers and can be used to deploy lightweight, efficient, and scalable Web services over heterogeneous nodes, including devices with limited resources. A performance evaluation on typical embedded devices validated the benefits of Node.DPWS compared to alternative DPWS libraries.",

        "Abstract": "A key goal of our research is to introduce an approach that involves at the outset using analytical reasoning as a method for developing high quality software. This paper summarizes our experiences in introducing mathematical reasoning and formal specification-based development using a web-integrated environment in an undergraduate software engineering course at two institutions at different levels, with the goal that they will serve as models for other educators. At Alabama, the reasoning topics are introduced over a two-week period and are followed by a project. At Clemson, the topics are covered in more depth over a five-week period and are followed by specification-based software development and reasoning assignments. The courses and project assignments have been offered for multiple semesters. Evaluation of student performance indicates that the learning goals were met.",

        "Abstract": "Doing things \"in the cloud\" has become ubiquitous and the \"cloud\" has become a rich platform for the use of modeling and simulation (M&S) anywhere and anytime to provide solutions to complex problems. Creation of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for building and executing visual M&S applications \"in the cloud\" poses significant technical challenges. This paper presents an architecture and a design of a cloud-based visual M&S IDE for the example problem domain \"traffic networks\". The IDE consists of integrated software tools that provide computer-aided assistance in the composition and visualization of simulation models under a web browser on a client computer while the simulation model is being executed on a server computer. Based on a client-server architecture enabling distributed multitiered M&S development, the design employs an asynchronous visualization protocol with efficient resource utilization. The architecture and design can assist researchers and developers to create other cloud-based visual M&S IDEs.",

        "Abstract": "Decision makers in modern enterprises need to assess so-called \"what-if\" scenarios and select the best of breed among the available alternatives. Although simulation plays a pivotal role in niche cases, it is an undervalued tool in the broader enterprise context. Its proliferation has not kept up with recent technological advances such as big data, cloud computing, graphics processing units clusters, and cross-layer enterprise integration. Based on such new developments, new capabilities can be realized that go beyond single-purpose simulations, and are an excellent fit for studying heterogeneous, independently developed System-of-Systems (SoS), in a multitude of scenarios in complex and dynamic enterprise environments. Co-simulation efforts can provide new insights on the enterprise operations including compelling visualizations of possible simulated alternatives, thereby assisting decision makers in their strategy selection. To move beyond niche applications, however, simulated systems need to integrate in real-time, a continually increasing amount of data (both real and simulated), stemming from various domains and their systems. This work presents a way to achieve such distributed simulations in modern enterprise environments, based on HighLevel Architecture (HLA), as well as their coordination via the Run-Time Infrastructure (RTI). In an example scenario featuring a co-simulation of a corporate electric vehicle fleet, it is shown how various software subsystems interact to enable business users to visually investigate scenarios, as well as how such a system can be deployed and operated within a modern enterprise IT landscape.",

However, the collaborative aspect of Grids is still underdeveloped as they lack features and mechanisms for human interaction and collaboration. This paper presents a prototype system for collaborative task planning and workflow development over a Grid implemented as a Rich Internet Application. It allows the participants to design their joint workflow interactively and collaboratively in a high level graphical notation. The resulting workflow can be automatically translated into Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) for testing and execution with a few clicks and forms the basis for further refinement and collaboration. This collaborative workflow design application is part of our larger Active Assistive Cloud/Grid infrastructure.",

        "Abstract": "Multiplayer Online Battle Arena or MOBA is one of the most popular game types at the present. The MOBA games have been developed from Real Time Strategy (RTS) games. The goal of MOBA games is to destroy the enemy main base or to get points by killing the enemy members up to the required number. Players of MOBA games usually practice their game skills by playing with a bot. As creating a bot is difficult and rather complex, therefore this paper proposes an idea to develop a distributed simulation system for training game coding and testing game codes by displaying results in a mini map (2-D map). A MOBA game API is also provided for cooperating with the simulation software and so is software supporting many users for their bot programming. In addition, users can use this software to test their bot codes or to practice bot programming in a unique style launched by their own idea and to see the results from the monitor. The software can also introduce a playing plan from the code that the user has already programmed.",

        "Abstract": "Sometimes, Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style proponents describe it as being easy, but this in no way implies that REST is trivial or simplistic, nor does it mean that RESTful systems lack sophistication. REST's relative simplicity comes from the fact that it not only clearly defines its trade-offs and constraints but also distinctly separates concerns, such as resource identification, resource interfaces, and definitions for interchanged data. This delineation makes it relatively easy for developers designing and building RESTful services to consider and track important issues that can profoundly impact system flexibility, scalability, and performance. REST isn't the answer to all distributed computing and integration problems by any stretch of the imagination, but it can yield highly practical solutions to a variety of such problems, not only on the Web but also within the enterprise.",

        "Abstract": "Most of the students coming from various different backgrounds find software programming a difficult subject to learn and master, especially in learning the concept of object-oriented programming. Because they must be able to model physical beings into virtualized objects and define complex object relationships in their designs for object interactions in a very abstract fashion that is not easily understood. This study is an attempt to introduce a unique interactive learning platform to students learning Java programming, which was designed with a set of object-oriented programming pedagogical considerations in mind. This study further extends and enhances with model-driven software development technique, such that to supporting unified modelling language (UML) class diagrams and code fragments generation in order to ease the learning needs of students, a unique way to learn fundamental programming concepts. This paper introduces a new online interactive platform and environment called BlueJ-UML, which is to help students to learn and practice object-oriented programming in class. It also evaluates the success outcome of the proposed new learning method through a Technology Acceptance Model Framework, and that followed by a comprehensive statistical analysis to assess improved academic performance of the students. The result was encouraging: student programming capability had been significantly elevated and was positively correlated to their overall perception and adoption of this new technique introduced in the class.",

        "Abstract": "Interoperability between collaborative development platforms (forges) in the Open Source Software world is a significant issue. The forges tend to follow the lock-in phenomenon, providing no easy-to-use facilities for migrating projects or their parts between forge platforms. To facilitate the process of cross-forge project migration, the following paper presents an approach of lifting forge data models to the semantic level and applying rule-based mappings for their alignment. The approach also involves Semantic Web Services to handle the process of importing/exporting project metadata from/to Open Source Software forges. Finally, the paper demonstrates the approach on the basis of proof-of-concept implementation exploiting the existing forges and presents the lessons learnt.",

        "Abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) system proposed in this paper is an advanced solution for monitoring the temperature at different points of location in a data centre, making this temperature data visible over internet through cloud based dashboard and sending SMS and email alerts to predefined recipients when temperature rises above the safe operating zone and reaches certain high values. This helps the datacenter management team to take immediate action to rectify this temperature deviation. Also this can be monitored from anywhere anytime over online dashboard by the senior level professionals who are not present in the data centre at any point in time. This Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) based monitoring system consists of temperature sensors, ESP8266 and Wi-Fi router. ESP8266 is a low power, highly integrated Wi-Fi solution from Espress if. The ESP8266 here, in this prototype, connects to `Ubidots' cloud through its API for posting temperature data to the cloud dashboard on real time and the cloud event management system generates alerts whenever the high temperature alert event is fired. Cloud events need to be configured for different alerts beforehand through the user friendly user interface of the platform. It's to be noted that the sensor used here can be leveraged to monitor the relative humidity of the data center environment as well along with the temperature of the data center. But for this prototype solution focus is kept entirely on the temperature monitoring.",

        "Abstract": "A cloud computing paradigm has quickly developed and been applied widely for more than ten years. In a cloud data center, cloud service providers offer many kinds of cloud services, such as virtual machines (VMs), to users. How to achieve the optimized allocation of VMs for users to satisfy the requirements of both users and providers is an important problem. To make full use of VMs for providers and ensure low makespan of user tasks, we formulate an optimal allocation model of VMs and develop an improved differential evolution (IDE) method to solve this optimization problem, given a batch of user tasks. We compare the proposed method with several existing methods, such as round-robin (RR), min-min, and differential evolution. The experimental results show that it can more efficiently decrease the cost of cloud service providers while achieving lower makespan of user tasks than its three peers. Note to Practitioners-VM allocation is one of the challenging problems in cloud computing systems, especially when user task makespan and cost of cloud service providers have to be considered together. We propose an IDE approach to solve this problem. To show its performance, this article compares the commonly used methods, i.e., RR and min-min, as well as the classic differential evolution method. A cloud simulation platform called CloudSim is used to test these methods. The experimental results show that the proposed one can well outperform its compared ones, and its VM allocation results can achieve the highest satisfaction of both users and providers. The proposed method can be readily applicable to industrial cloud computing systems.",

In order to quickly and accurately recommend high-quality code snippets for programmers, this paper Sentence-BERT model. Firstly, the method obtains a large amount of high-quality data to build the code base, and proposes a code snippet recommendation method based on generates sentence vectors with rich semantics for the natural language description corresponding to the code snippets and the natural language query input by users based on the deep learning model SBERT. Then, the code snippets are recommended by comparing the dot product similarity. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by comparing the three commonly used evaluation indexes of hit rate, average reciprocal ranking and average accuracy with the methods in the current related research. Experimental results show that this recommendation method can effectively improve the accuracy and effect of code snippet recommendation.",

Mathematical models based on Linear programming for web site are developed to structure web objects so that most relevant web contents can be reachable more efficiently with the optimal-structured web objects. In the web structuring model, arc weights that represent weights for hyperlinks are used to rank the degrees of the relevance among web objects. We also developed a tree-filtering algorithm and a top_k Steiner tree algorithm that can be used to provide search recommendations in practical applications. With real web sites' information, some examples are given for more detail explanations of the structured web search mechanism.",

        "Abstract": "Software visualizations are usually realized as standalone and isolated tools that use embedded code viewers within the visualization. In the context of program comprehension, only few approaches integrate visualizations into code editors, such as integrated development environments. This is surprising since professional developers consider reading source code as one of the most important ways to understand software, therefore spend a lot of time with code editors. In this paper, we introduce the design and proof-of-concept implementation for a software visualization approach that can be embedded into code editors. Our contribution differs from related work in that we use dynamic analysis of a software system's runtime behavior. Additionally, we incorporate distributed tracing. This enables developers to understand how, for example, the currently handled source code behaves as a fully deployed, distributed software system. Our visualization approach enhances common remote pair programming tools and is collaboratively usable by employing shared code cities. As a result, user interactions are synchronized between code editor and visualization, as well as broadcasted to collaborators. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that combines code editors with collaboratively usable code cities. Therefore, we conducted a user study to collect first-time feedback regarding the perceived usefulness and perceived usability of our approach. We additionally collected logging information to provide more data regarding time spent in code cities that are embedded in code editors. Seven teams with two students each participated in that study. The results show that the majority of participants find our approach useful and would employ it for their own use. We provide each participant's video recording, raw results, and all steps to reproduce our experiment as supplementary package. Furthermore, a live demo of our tool is available online.11https.//code.explorviz.dev We invite other researchers to extend our open-source software.22https://github.com/ExplorViz Video URL: https://youtu.be/3qZVSehnEug",

        "Abstract": "Debugging is an inevitable activity in most software projects, often difficult and more time-consuming than expected, giving it the nickname the \"dirty little secret of computer science.\" Surprisingly, we have little knowledge on how software engineers debug software problems in the real world, whether they use dedicated debugging tools, and how knowledgeable they are about debugging. This study aims to shed light on these aspects by following a mixed-methods research approach. We conduct an online survey capturing how 176 developers reflect on debugging. We augment this subjective survey data with objective observations on how 458 developers use the debugger included in their integrated development environments (IDEs) by instrumenting the popular Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEs with the purpose-built plugin WatchDog 2.0. To clarify the insights and discrepancies observed in the previous steps, we followed up by conducting interviews with debugging experts and regular debugging users. Our results indicate that IDE-provided debuggers are not used as often as expected, as \"printf debugging\" remains a feasible choice for many programmers. Furthermore, both knowledge and use of advanced debugging features are low. These results call to strengthen hands-on debugging experience in computer science curricula and have already refined the implementation of modern IDE debuggers.",

Without them, large software development projects would soon incur in loss of productivity and severe maintenance issues. The revision history is invaluable during reviewing process as well as bug hunting. With the advent of Web 2.0, many tasks have been migrated to a cloud environment, and among them is software development. This spikes the need for a fast, always-on version control system residing in the cloud. Moreover, the cloud computational power can be leveraged to provide a higher degree of automation. In this paper, we describe Protego, a cloud-based version control system targeting flexibility and automation. Flexibility in the way projects and histories are recorded and updated, automation in the way users interact with the system, with a reduced need for everyday tedious operations.",

Our proposed Smart cold storage and inventory monitoring system uses sensor-based IoT technology to offer remote monitoring and tracking the produce. Our paper proposed methodology is early warning alerts and notifications in critical conditions. It enables end-end visibility and accountability across the entire product value chain. The perishable goods are often required to travel thousands of miles by land, air, water transport facilities to reach their final destination. It creates a lot of pressure on tracking the companies using the cold storage supporters for the distribution of the food and maintain a certain temperature during the entire journey. This mainly causes a panic situation for the business owners, stakeholders and industrialists. It may also cause damage to the inventory system and time. Our system enables endless real time monitoring. It helps in controlling the losses which occur for business. As per the research India has 7645 cold storage facilities, out of these about 68% is used to store vegetables. And remaining 32% is used for storing other commodities. In the proposed cold storage system Temperature and Humidity sensor, Ultrasonic sensor, Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller board and Mobile application are used.",

In this work we propose a plugin for Visual Studio Code, which we name Dockerlive, and that has the purpose of shortening the length of feedback loops. Namely, the plugin is capable of providing information to developers on a number of Dockerfile elements, as the developer is writing the Dockerfile. We achieve this through dynamic analysis of the resulting container, which the plugin builds and runs in the background.",

        "Abstract": "Farmers need top-notch soil with strong natural mineral contents for the traditional farming approach. It also involves labour costs. It also requires a lot of land and water for weeding and ploughing. When it comes to seasonal plants, the yield falls short of meeting both consumer demands and farmer productivity expectations. Due to these characteristics,a farming technique that is less expensive to implement and thatalso makes it simple to manage and regulate key variables like light, temperature, and humidity all through the year is required. The procedure of cultivating plants hydroponically without light from the sun or soil is described in the proposed study. The level of the fertilizer solution and the presence of algae are monitored, and variables like humidity and temperature are assessed. As the level of the nutrient solution drops, a mechanism for automatically dispensing nutrient solution is also designed. The fresh nutrient solution is supplied to the container after emptying the current solution when presence of algae is identified. Farmers can routinely check their crops to improve their growth and output from the cloud-basedstorage of the sensor data.",

        "Abstract": "End-to-end automated test scripts are a great way to ensure the quality of web applications, but are often perceived as expensive both during their initial development and subsequent maintenance activities. However, maintenance costs can be re-duced when test scripts adopt the Page Object (PO) pattern, a sort of web page facade exposing methods to the test scripts. In this work, we proposed ASSESSOR, a novel tool capable of reducing the effort needed for building PO-based Selenium WebDriver test suites. ASSESSOR allows to simply record the test cases, with only a few additional steps compared to Selenium IDE, and then to automatically generate PO-based WebDriver test suites. The in-depth evaluation performed with four web applications shows that ASSESSOR's adoption allows to reduce the development effort of PO-based web test scripts compared to the classic manual approach: 59% time reduction overall, corresponding to a 2.44 increment in productivity.",

        "Abstract": "Today’s problems require a plethora of analytics tasks to be conducted to tackle state-of-the-art computational challenges posed in society impacting many areas including health care, automotive, banking, natural language processing, image detection, and many more data analytics-related tasks. Sharing existing analytics functions allows reuse and reduces overall effort. However, integrating deployment frameworks in the age of cloud computing are often out of reach for domain experts. Simple frameworks are needed that allow even non-experts to deploy and host services in the cloud. To avoid vendor lock-in, we require a generalized composable analytics service framework that allows users to integrate their services and those offered in clouds, not only by one, but by many cloud compute and service providers.We report on work that we conducted to provide a service integration framework for composing generalized analytics frame-works on multi-cloud providers that we call our Generalized AI Service (GAS) Generator. We demonstrate the framework’s usability by showcasing useful analytics workflows on various cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, and Google, and edge computing IoT devices. The examples are based on Scikit learn so they can be used in educational settings, replicated, and expanded upon. Benchmarks are used to compare the different services and showcase general replicability.",

        "Abstract": "Even though technologically advanced processors based on 32 and 64 bit are now available, embedded systems still rely on the use 8 or 16 bit microcontroller solutions, due to factors such as cost-effectiveness and low power consumption. Its widespread adoption by the industry and its simplicity led the academy to address the development of systems using these 8 or 16 bit microcontrollers in its introductory-level electrical engineering curricula. Typically, a microcontroller of the MSP, AVR, MCS-51 or PIC family is used. Although in person laboratory work offers students the opportunity for acquiring skills related to practical experience with hardware and development boards, availability of hardware resources might be reduced in autonomous or online contexts. In these scenarios, simulation tools can be highly valuable, as an alternative or complementary option to laboratory work. Standard development tools are often unsuited for such purposes, because they are oriented to development activities that often assume the availability of hardware resources for executing, testing and debugging the system. To address this, this paper presents a survey of the ecosystem of tools for 8 or 16 bit microprocessors and microcontrollers development focused on their capability for supporting the simulation of embedded systems, and evaluate these solutions from the perspective of their potential for enabling autonomous study and learning by students. This comparative analysis can be very useful as it can serve as a decision factor for the choice of the microcontroller or microprocessor and toolchain to adopt in curriculum design, while it also identifies opportunities for new developments to address existing limitations.",

Among the many online resources, Question & Answer websites are gaining popularity. This is no wonder if we consider a case like Stack Overflow, where more than 92% questions on expert topics are answered in a median time of 11 minutes. This new resource has scarcely been acknowledged by any Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Even though developers spend a large part of their working time in IDEs, and the usage of Q&A services has dramatically increased, developers can only use such resources using external applications. We introduce Seahawk, an Eclipse plugin to integrate Stack Overflow crowd knowledge in the IDE. It allows developers to seamlessly access Stack Overflow data, thus obtaining answers without switching the context. We present our preliminary work on Seahawk: It allows users to (1) retrieve Q&A from Stack Overflow, (2) link relevant discussions to any source code in Eclipse, and (3) attach explanative comments to the links.",

        "Abstract": "Developing service compositions, using multiple standards and implementation techniques, typically involves specifying service characteristics in different languages and tools. Examples are defining service composition behaviour, in the form of the business process execution language for Web services (WS-BPEL) and a global service choreography policy, in the form of the Web service choreography description language (WS-CDL). Whilst there have been a number of model-based analysis tools reported, there is a lack of integration with development environments to support analysis of these different service artifacts. In this paper we present a short history of some of the analysis tools reported, discuss an appropriate criteria of accessible integrated development with analysis features and provide an example approach, called \"service engineer\" using our tools and integration work. The approach is supported by an integrated service tool-chain development environment known as the SENSORIA development environment. The aim is to provide an accessible, rigorous approach to analysing service compositions but with a simple, clearly defined interface in an integrated development environment.",

        "Abstract": "Building scalable web applications on top of NoSQL data stores is becoming common practice. Many of these data stores can easily be accessed programmatically, and do not enforce a schema. Software engineers can design the data model on the go, a flexibility that is crucial in agile software development. The typical tasks of database schema management are now handled within the application code, usually involving object mapper libraries. However, today's Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) lack the proper tool support when it comes to managing the combined evolution of the application code and of the schema. Yet simple refactorings such as renaming an attribute at the source code level can cause irretrievable data loss or runtime errors once the application is serving in production. In this demo, we present ControVol, a framework for controlled schema evolution in application development against NoSQL data stores. ControVol is integrated into the IDE and statically type checks object mapper class declarations against the schema evolution history, as recorded by the code repository. ControVol is capable of warning of common yet risky cases of mismatched data and schema. ControVol is further able to suggest quick fixes by which developers can have these issues automatically resolved.",

        "Abstract": "The World-Wide Web represents an opportunistic Internet-based platform on which many new applications are developing rapidly. To facilitate fast Web applications, a scripting approach is one possible solution for software developers. However, then are two major drawbacks for many existing scripting tools. First, most of these scripting tools are proprietary, and only available on chosen platforms. Second, most scripting tools use the Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML) as the basis for extension. To provide extra functionality such as database connection, various extended codes or commands are mixed with HTML tags to produce expected results. However, this dirty approach will make the design and development process more complicated. We propose a systematic and flexible scripting framework for fast Web application development. The two major components, layout script and information-processing script, naturally reflect the static and dynamic properties of a Web application. In addition, the information-processing script can flexibly be split into different component scripts to suit different applications. We built a prototype of a script parser and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) tool to quickly develop an intelligent Web-based Personal Computer Configuration Advisor. Clearly, our proposal opens up many possible directions for investigation including the uses of the IDE tool to develop other applications, and the integration with other components to handle more complicated Web applications.",

        "Abstract": "Developers use the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to develop a system at hand, by reading, understanding, and writing its source code. They do so by exploiting the tools and facilities provided by the IDE. This also allows them to build a mental model of the system to perform informed changes. It is however not clear how and when developers use which facility and tool, and to what extent the current services offered by the IDE appropriately support the navigation. We present an approach to visualize the activities of developers within the IDE, implemented in a tool: DFLow. DFLOW records all IDE interactions that occur during a development session and visualizes them through a web-based visualization platform.",

        "Abstract": "C is a popular programming language because of high portability and simple syntax. As a result, it is the first course for most of university students who major in computer, electronics, and electrical engineering and so on. To obtain a good learning achievement, students usually need to put their effort and time on programming as much as possible. Therefore, a ubiquitous integrated development environment is helpful for students to practice programming anytime and anywhere. To achieve this goal, we develop a novel integrated development environment called Ubi-C for C programming based on Clang and LLVM in this paper. Using this IDE, users can directly write, compile, execute and debug their C programs on Android-based smart phones or tablets. Moreover, this IDE provides the API of multimedia programming, and integrates with cloud services such as Dropbox for storing user programs and data. Consequently, users can easily develop multimedia applications by using C on mobile devices, and can switch their working environments between mobile devices and fixed computers with the support of Dropbox.",

In recent years, most of the computer-based learning systems record the interaction log of each learner when developing course assignments. However, the recorded data is facing a challenge to expose the learners behaviors during the course and to design a computer-supported collaborative learning activity. To address those challenges in this paper, a novel collaborative programming tool called Software Project Development and Insight Learning Environment (SPDI Learning Environment) is described. The SPDI Learning environment allows learners of computer science to develop course assignments collaboratively. Besides, it allows instructors to investigate the learners behaviors by associating a web-based integrated development environment (IDE) with Big Data analysis pipeline and Visualization Dashboard. In addition to collect real data from courses, we designed learning activities to help teachers to engage the field of CSCL and Learning Analytics.",

        "Abstract": "Agile software development approaches have emerged to overcome the inherent challenges of the traditional software development methodologies. With that in mind, they offer a set of simple yet effective practices based on the values and supporting principles of the Agile Manifesto. Today, more and more organizations are practicing Agile but transitioning to Agile is not as straightforward as it might seem. The benefits afforded by the agile values, principles and practices are not fully obtained and adapters struggle to become more mature; i.e. increase their Agility. For, adapters to address this problem, agility assessments have been designed to be aware of the situation of their transition and make sure that they are heading in the right direction. However, these assessments still require significant amount of time and effort to apply. To overcome this problem, we have developed a web-based agility assessment tool which is a part of an integrated agility assessment approach. The approach consists of a structured and comprehensive agility assessment model (AgilityMod), an exemplar agility assessment process and a web based agility assessment tool (AssessAgility). This research focuses on the final component of the approach: AssessAgility tool and presents a multiple case study that was conducted to evaluate tool's capabilities in terms of providing guidance, automation and reducing the effort spent on the assessments.",

        "Abstract": "Video-based programming tutorials are a popular form of tutorial used by authors to guide learners to code. Still, the interactivity of these videos is limited primarily to control video flow. There are existing works with increased interactivity that are shown to improve the learning experience. Still, these solutions require setting up a custom recording environment and are not well-integrated with the playback environment. This paper describes our integrated ITSS environment and evaluates the ease of authoring and playback of our interactive programming tutorials. Our environment is designed to run within the browser sandbox and is less intrusive to record interactivity actions. We develop a recording approach that tracks the author’s interactivity actions (e.g., typing code, highlighting words, scrolling panels) on the browser and stored in text and audio formats. We replay these actions using the recorded artefacts for learners to have a more interactive, integrated and realistic playback of the author’s actions instead of watching video frames. Our design goals are 1) eﬃcient recording and playback, 2) extensible interactivity features to help students learn better, and 3) a scalable web-based environment. Our first user study of 20 participants who carry out the author tasks agree that it is eﬃcient and easy to author interactive videos in our environment with no additional software needed. Our second user study of 84 students using the environment agrees that the increased interactivity can help them learn better over a video-based tutorial. Our performance test shows that the environment can scale to support up to 500 concurrent users. We hope our open-source environment enable more educators to create interactive programming tutorials.",

        "Abstract": "It is believed that future technologies related to smart devices could add more towards making life easy while saving on time for a person on the go. Already mobile devices have added value to our everyday tasks. However, programmers, so far, seem to be denied the use of such facilities with these smart devices. Distributed Integrated Development Environment for Mobile Platforms (DIMP) is directed towards them with an innovative way to write software programs on the go. Using a mobile device such as a mobile phone or a tablet computer, DIMP is capable of writing source codes and compiling. DIMP consists of a mobile application, a central server and a set of compilation servers, while an administrative web console supports the administrative functions. Together, they comprise DIMP. The mobile application is an android application and provides a rich source code editor integrated to the software. It allows compiling and running of source codes where users can write programs in a selected language. If the source code is error free, a user can expect a worthwhile output whereas an error prone source code would reveal the relevant error message with useful hints for debugging. A further benefit from DIMP is that it allows a user to maintain online work space as well as an offline workspace. Source codes can be shared with other interested users.",

        "Abstract": "Distributed software development poses extra difficulties in terms of communication, coordination and awareness. Those difficulties usually imply more time consumption that causes productiveness reduction deriving finally in delays. So, projects where such kind of development is needed have to deal with them in order to ensure the success of the project. The case project has adopted this development approach due to its nature. The main goal of the project is to develop a cloud solution for enhancing collaboration and transparency between manufacturing companies forming a collaborative network. In order to implement it, the overall solution has been divided into several pieces, having many interdependencies among them. Thus, different working teams geographically spread from different organizations have participated in the implementation, integration, verification and validation tasks. This paper explains how the case project has organized the working teams, infrastructure, procedures and practices to guarantee the success of the project.",

First, tools are increasingly constructed on the basis of external code, reusing, for instance, existing frameworks and integrated development environments. Second, researchers often choose dynamic languages such as Smalltalk to implement prototype tools. Third, Web-based tools are starting to incorporate Web 2.0 technologies to improve user interaction. Finally, increasing computational resources allow tools to tackle larger, real-world code bases.",

In the era of web-based software, the web browser will serve as the primary user interface for end-user applications. In this paper, we introduce the Lively Dock, a user interface mechanism that can be used to host miniaturized yet active web applications in a web browser. The system is built as an extension to the Lively Kernel, a programming environment that runs inside a web browser without additional plug-in components. The Lively Dock makes it possible to easily manage a large number of simultaneously running web applications, widgets and other visual objects in the web browser. Consequently, the web browser can easily be used as a windowing environment.",

        "Abstract": "Heavily script-based browser applications change the manner in which users interact with Web browsers. Instead of downloading a succession of HTML pages, users download a single application and use that application for a long period of time. The application is not a set of HTML pages, but rather a single page that can possible modify its own presentation based on data exchanged with a server. In such an environment, it is necessary to provide some means for the client to manage its own state. We describe the initial results of our work in providing client-side state management services for these script-based applications. We focus on browser-based services that can help the user before any data is committed on the server. Our services include state checkpointing, property binding, operation logging, operational replay, ATOM/RSS data updates, and application-controlled persistence.",

        "Abstract": "Currently, web-based online gaming applications are predominately utilising Adobe Flash or Java Applets as their core technologies. These games are often casual, two-dimensional games and do not utilise the specialist graphics hardware which has proliferated across modern PCs and Consoles. Multi-user online game play in these titles is often either non-existent or extremely limited. Computer games applications which grace the current generation of consoles and personal computers are designed to utilise the increasingly impressive hardware power at their disposal. However, these are commonly distributed using a physical medium or deployed through custom, proprietary networking mechanisms and rely upon platform-specific networking APIs to facilitate multi-user online game play. In order to unify the concepts of these disparate styles of gaming, in this paper we propose a novel integrated development environment called Homura and NetHomura. Homura is based on the Eclipse platform and extends the jME game engine, with new interfaces, content and libraries, thus, providing a software suite that integrates source editors, compilers, including spatial and positional editors to afford advanced graphical functionalities within the IDE. We also present two interconnected systems which are implemented using Java Web Start and JXTA P2P technologies, providing a platform-independent framework capable of deploying hardware accelerated cross-platform, cross-browser online-enabled Java games, as part of the NetHomura Project.",

        "Abstract": "The computing education community has shown a long-time interest in how to analyze the Object-Oriented (OO) source code developed by students to provide them with useful formative tips. In this paper, we propose and evaluate an approach to analyze how students use Java and its language constructs. The approach is implemented through a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) and it is based on the analysis of the most common violations of the OO paradigm in the student source code. Moreover, the IDE supports the automatic generation of reports about student's mistakes and misconceptions that can be used by instructors to improve the course design. The paper discusses the preliminary results of an experiment performed in a class of a Programming II course to investigate the effects of the provided reports in terms of coding ability (concerning the correctness of the produced code).",

        "Abstract": "Modern smartphones have a rich spectrum of increasingly sophisticated features, opening opportunities for software-led innovation. Of the large number of platforms to develop new software on, in this paper we look closely at three platforms identified as market leaders for the smartphone market by Gartner Group in 2013 and one platform, Firefox OS, representing a new paradigm for operating systems based on web technologies. We compare the platforms in several different categories, such as software architecture, application development, platform capabilities and constraints, and, finally, developer support. Using the implementation of a mobile version of the tic-tac-toe game on all the four platforms, we seek to investigate strengths, weaknesses and challenges of mobile application development on these platforms. Big differences are highlighted when inspecting community environments, hardware abilities and platform maturity. These inevitably impact upon developer choices when deciding on mobile platform development strategies.",

        "Abstract": "When faced with the need for documentation, examples, bug fixes, error descriptions, code snippets, workarounds, templates, patterns, or advice, software developers frequently turn to their Web browser. Web resources both organized and authoritative as well as informal and community-driven are heavily used by developers. The time and attention devoted to finding (or re-finding) and navigating these sites is significant. We present Codetrail, a system that demonstrates how the developerpsilas use of Web resources can be improved by connecting the Eclipse IDE and the Firefox Web browser. Codetrail uses a communication channel and shared data model between these applications to implement a variety of integrative tools. By combining information previously available only to the IDE or the Web browser alone (such as editing history, code contents, and recent browsing), Codetrail can automate previously manual tasks and enable new interactions that exploit the marriage of data and functionality from Firefox and Eclipse. Just as the IDE will change the contents of peripheral views to focus on the particular code or task with which the developer is engaged, so, too, the web browser can be focused on the developerpsilas current context and task.",

        "Abstract": "Cloud manufacturing (CMfg) has emerged as a next-generation manufacturing paradigm that has potential to revolutionize the manufacturing industry. In further promotion of CMfg, how to build CMfg services in an automatic and efficient manner is an essential and challenging subject. Currently, there is no literature addressing such issue. Aimed at facilitating rapid construction of CMfg services, this letter proposes a novel automated construction scheme for developing CMfg services, called Manufacturing Service Automated Construction Scheme (MSACS). First, we develop a three-phase workflow of MSACS to address the issues of how to construct CMfg services automatically using standalone software library package (SSLP). Next, we design a system architecture of MSACS to delineate how to implement MSACS. Then, we depict the designs of MSACS's core components. Finally, we apply MSACS to conduct industrial case studies to build the automatic virtual metrology cloud service and intelligent yield management cloud service for an intelligent manufacturing platform. Testing results demonstrate that MSACS can automatically construct the target CMfg services in a very efficient manner after uploading the required SSLPs. Thus, MSACS can significantly alleviate the burden of engineers in building CMfg services, and in turn can facilitate the promotion of CMfg.",

        "Abstract": "Missing data is a major data reliability problem in spatio-temporal (ST) applications. This article proposes an online method for estimating missing data in case of a network of $n$ sensors. The true sensor value at a specific location is expressed using an integro-difference equation. The Karhunen–Loéve Expansion of the spatial process allows one to represent the ST field values at $n$ locations in the form of a linear state-space model. The parameters of the model are identified using the maximum likelihood method. The parameters are updated in a rolling window approach. Whenever missing data are encountered, the algorithm predicts the missing observations based on the constrained solution of state evolution equation. The constrained solution is obtained by representing the optimal state as the orthogonal sum decomposition of a deterministic and a stochastic component. The utility of the algorithm is presented on two sensor network datasets.",

Significance: The web browser-based multimodal interactive simulation provides 3D interactive graphics, integration of electronic apparatuses including haptic devices, and computationally intensive simulation on the web browser directly. The software development environment is solely based on the license-free HTML5 standard, which enables the features with no need to install any additional software. Unlike typical applications, the web browser-based applications can directly run on a wide variety of user's existing machines such as desktop, laptop, tablets, smartphones, and even forthcoming platform, e.g., smart TVs. The accessibility and convenience is significant in that the framework will establish a new paradigm for development of multimodal interactive simulation. Impact: The web browser-based multimodal interactive simulation will be expected to innovatively reduce the initial setup and maintenance cost and effort compared to conventional systems, allows wide adoption of the developed applications over the world through the internet, which result in a much better overall haptics-related system.",

        "Abstract": "Many scientific, engineering and business applications benefit from the ability to submit a large number of computational jobs to a Condor pool simultaneously. However, crafting a correct Condor submission script is not trivial, especially for the less computer command line-savvy users. Therefore, developers often wish to create a job submission page in a Web client application for the Condor system to provide an easy way for users to run their computation jobs. In doing so, the developers must understand the Condor ClassAd mechanism and provide a proper transformation if the application needs to support user or application defined ClassAds. This paper describes a rapid and easy way of creating a job submission page using our visual Web components. By integrating these components into a popular web application integrated development environment (IDE), the developers can easily compose a Condor job submission page by dragging and dropping the components. This will significantly reduce the time spent on creating the job submission application.",

There are various focal points of test automation. They are exceptionally exact and have more prominent preparing pace when contrasted with manual automation. There are various open source and business devices accessible for test mechanization. Selenium is one of the broadly utilized open source device for test computerization. Test automation enhances the effectiveness of programming testing procedures. Test automation gives quick criticism to engineers. It additionally discovers the imperfections when one may miss in the manual testing. In test automation we can perform boundless emphases for testing the same example of code ceaselessly commonly.",

The demands on system scalability, performance and reliability are ever increasing. Industry solutions with widespread adoption include the microservices architecture, the container technology and the DevOps methodology. These approaches have changed software engineering practice in such a profound way that we argue that it is becoming a paradigm shift. In this paper, we examine the current support of programming languages for the key concepts behind the change in software engineering practice and argue that a novel programming language is required to support the new paradigm. We report a new programming language CAOPLE and its associated Integrated DevOps Environment CIDE and demonstrate the utility of both.",

        "Abstract": "As more work is conducted in mining software repositories at a large scale, aggregating data from multiple modalities beyond textual representations will prove beneficial. Online video content related to software engineering offers another, thus far largely untapped, venue for source code. In this paper, we present a novel dataset comprised of 111,229 frames extracted from a sample of 100 technology-related YouTube tutorials, taught in the Java and Python programming languages. These videos span a diverse range of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and modes of information presentation, lending heterogeneity of image features to our dataset. Hand-labeled for the presence, or lack thereof, of typeset, partially visible typeset, or handwritten code, the dataset provides a uniquely consistent and accurate data source for supervised machine learning ventures in extracting and processing code from images.",

        "Abstract": "Tools are an essential part of every software engineering project. But the number of tools that are used in all phases of the software development life-cycle and their complexity is growing continually. Consequently, the setup and maintenance of current tool chains and development environments requires much effort and consumes a lot of time. One approach to counter this, is to employ web-based systems for development tasks, because centralized systems simplify the administration and the deployment of new features. But desktop IDEs play an important role in software development projects today, and will not be replaced entirely by web-based environments in the near future. Therefore, supporting a mixture of hosted tools and tools integrated into desktop IDEs is a sensible approach. In this paper, we present the SSELab, a framework for web-based project portals that attempts to migrate more software development tools from desktop to server environments, but still allows their integration into modern desktop IDEs. It supports the deployment of tools as hosted services using plug-in systems on the server-side. Additionally, it provides access to these tools by a set of clients that can be used in different contexts, either from the command line, from within IDEs such as Eclipse, or from web pages. In the paper, we discuss the architecture and the extensibility of the SSELab framework. Furthermore, we share our experiences with creating an instance of the framework and integrating various tools for our own software development projects.",

        "Abstract": "The OutSystems Platform is a visual model-driven development and delivery platform that allows developers to create enterprise-grade web and mobile applications. The models created with the platform are translated by its compiler into a set of standard-technology artifacts (C#, JavaScript, SQL, etc). The model must be checked for consistency (i.e., that it is well-formed and well-typed) before compilation can proceed. Our Integrated Development Environment (IDE) does this in real-time: after each change made a developer, the IDE either automatically heals the other parts of the model that are impacted by the change, or provides immediate feedback on the errors that must be manually corrected. It is not uncommon for an OutSystems model to contain in excess of 200,000 individual elements. Handling large models efficiently is thus of paramount importance: consistency checks must run as fast as possible, otherwise the developer's experience is significantly impaired. In this paper we present the techniques we have developed to speed up consistency checks, and which resulted in the TrueChangeTM engine. We use an incremental approached paired with automatically managed back pointers. We believe these techniques are of general application and not limited to our particular case.",

        "Abstract": "Refactoring is a disciplined technique for restructuring code to improve its readability and maintainability. Almost all modern integrated development environments (IDEs) offer built-in support for automated refactoring tools. However, the user interface for refactoring tools has remained largely unchanged from the menu and dialog approach introduced in the Smalltalk Refactoring Browser, the first automated refactoring tool, more than a decade ago. As the number of supported refactorings and their options increase, invoking and configuring these tools through the traditional methods have become increasingly unintuitive and inefficient. The contribution of this paper is a novel approach that eliminates the use of menus and dialogs altogether. We streamline the invocation and configuration process through direct manipulation of program elements via drag-and-drop. We implemented and evaluated this approach in our tool, Drag-and-Drop Refactoring (DNDRefactoring), which supports up to 12 of 23 refactorings in the Eclipse IDE. Empirical evaluation through surveys and controlled user studies demonstrates that our approach is intuitive, more efficient, and less error-prone compared to traditional methods available in IDEs today. Our results bolster the need for researchers and tool developers to rethink the design of future refactoring tools.",

        "Abstract": "The article discusses the applied precision farming systems designed to increase the driving accuracy of agricultural machinery regardless of external conditions, reduce the cost of fuel, fertilizers, seeds, improve the quality of field cultivation and increase yields - parallel driving systems, autopilots and agronavigators. The article considers ready-made solutions for precision farming available on the market, navigation receivers and antennas suitable for precise positioning purposes. The use of freely available software - RTKLib library for accurate positioning using RTK technology (Real Time Kinematic) is considered. The article proposes to create a budget positioning system that will measure the location of agricultural machinery with an accuracy of a centimeter, using the RTKLib library to create an accurate heading guide or agronavigator. The possibility of creating a high-precision GPS / GLONASS navigation receiver was also considered, where data processing using RTK technology occurs on the receiver board itself using a microcontroller, as a result, it was concluded that it is advisable to use 32-bit STM32 microcontrollers with an ARM Cortex-M4 core. To develop a device prototype, it is proposed to use a development board based on STM32 Nucleo and a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) Mbed, and for the final serial device, it is desirable to use low-level programming at the register level using CMSIS libraries using software from STM: a convenient STM32Cube initialization code generator, and the Atollic True Studio IDE.",

        "Abstract": "Integrated development environment (IDE) plugins aimed at detecting web application security vulnerabilities can help developers create secure applications in the first place. Most of such IDE plugins use static source code analysis approaches. Although several empirical studies evaluated the plugins and compared their precision and recall of detecting web application security, few follow-up studies tried to understand the evaluation results. We analyzed more than 20,000 vulnerability reports based on 7,215 distinct test cases spanning 11 categories of web application vulnerabilities to understand the evaluation results of three open-source IDE plugins, namely, SpotBugs, FindSecBugs, and Early Security Vulnerability Detector (ESVD), which aimed at detecting security vulnerabilities of Java-based web applications. Our results identify many factors besides the source code analysis approach that can dramatically bias the detection performance. Based on our insights, we improved the studied plugins. In addition, our study raises the alarm that, without solid root cause analyses, the evaluation and comparisons of security vulnerability detection approaches and tools could be misleading. Thus, we proposed a guideline on reporting the evaluation results of the security vulnerability detection approaches.",

It is imperative that immediate action is taken to improve air quality in some regions of the world. In order to address this issue on a large scale, this research project aims to provide real-time data monitoring and air purification for the city. A lack of precision, low sensitivity, and the need for laboratory analysis mean that current monitoring systems are ineffective. Thus, new and improved monitoring systems are required. This system uses filtering technology and a real-time dashboard to solve the shortcomings of current solutions. An IoT system is an interconnected network of smart devices that can sense and communicate with each other and other systems. Arduino Integrated Development Environment(Arduino IDE), a Wi-Fi module from Arduino, and sensors for gas, dust, pressure, and temperature were used to build the data-gathering hardware. Instruments that measure air pollution and fresh air might be installed in the purification system. The Arduino IDE receives data from the gas sensors, which collect data from the surrounding environment. The Wi-Fi module of the Arduino IDE delivers the data to the cloud. Users can get important air quality data from the cloud via the web page \"Wayu.live,\" built by our team. Air quality indicator levels can also be used by the government for negotiations and forecasting.",

        "Abstract": "This paper proposes a cloud application framework, which integrates both the development and production environment seamlessly. The framework consists of the client-side integrated development environment (IDE), and the server-side service portfolio and cloud controller. The IDE has requirement definition, architecture design and application prototyping tools, and it can simulate execution of large-scale applications in developers' PCs. The service portfolio incorporates data from these tools and enables automatic data sharing between them, thereby avoiding setback and redundancy. To accommodate the applications on the cloud, the cloud controller utilizes the resource structures designed in the IDE and generates virtual machines (VMs) from templates, in which a verified OS and middleware for large-scale data processing are packaged. The behavior of VMs and applications will be automatically monitored and catalogued as a guideline for the next project. With these comprehensive approaches, the system integration methods can be streamlined and the acceleration of development can be easily demonstrated.",

        "Abstract": "Nowadays, many novel blockchain-based architecture and frameworks are proposed to solve issues in computer science and financial service. Smart contracts with blockchain systems, especially consortium blockchain systems, can help to provide many reliable and efficient functions for existing systems like smart grid payments. The novel concept of smart contract as a service is proposed but the difficulty of developing smart contracts on various kinds of blockchain systems are also significantly increasing which brings the additional cost for both developers and infrastructure builders. In this paper, we present an updated cloud-based smart integrated smart contract development system, ChainIDE 2.0, for the ultra-efficient development of blockchain-based smart contracts on multiple kinds of blockchain systems. Not only we stay as the most popular cloud-based developing Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the Libra blockchain, but also we introduce the consortium blockchain systems such as Ant Financial Open-Chain (Ant OC) and served as the first cloud-based IDE supporting the Ant Financial OpenChain test net. Today, we have served almost 1 million compiled smart contracts which makes us the most popular cloud-based blockchain development IDE in the world.",

Adopted traditional architectural styles do not cover the whole requirements of the development process, with extensibility being the major drawback. Service-oriented computing is exploited in this paper, to define an architectural framework for a demand-led ESs development process. Features required in the development process are defined as Web-services, published in the public domain, and used on demand through semantic Web by developers to construct their projects' specific integrated development environment (IDE). The way that these services affect the development process is discussed with main focus on an ontology-based device modeling.",

The intelligent home system creates the more comfortable, safer, humane and intelligent living environment. It can resolve the problems facing by the people who have busy schedules and get a very less amount of time to spend at home which is increasing rapidly around the world. For the solution of this problem, user can depend on the automated machines and gadgets like smart phones. These smart gadgets are using cloud computing which sends and receives signal o the cloud. The data that is of our use can be fetched by matching some key values using the concept of information retrieval. The key objective of this paper is to create a full-fledged application which could let user to operate the lights of their house from any remote location. The user have a list of options to select which light is to be on and when. The only requirement is to have working wifi at home to which the lights are connected.

        "Abstract": "Solana is a blockchain platform with its own token, called SOL or Solana. As a blockchain network, Solana is a de-centralized public ledger for verifying and recording transactions. The Solana blockchain has smart contract capabilities. Unlike other blockchains, such as Ethereum, there is no repository or tool where to check for the source code of the smart contracts stored in the blockchain. These tools are crucial to increase the users' trust in this type of technology. Indeed, one of the most important features of the blockchain is transparency, i.e. the possibility to see the source code of the program to use, or in which the users wish to invest. However, in the blockchains that support smart contracts, what is stored is not the source code of the smart contract written in a high-level program understandable to humans, but the bytecode, i.e. a low-level code made for the hardware to be executed. For some blockchains, such as Ethereum, there are different tools, such as integrated development environment (IDE), that allow to verify that the smart contracts' source code corresponds to the bytecode installed on the nodes of the blockchain. Moreover, there are different repositories that collect smart contracts written in a high-level programming language and their corresponding bytecode. However, for the Solana blockchain, all these tools do not exist yet. The study proposes a web tool that allows verifying the ownership of a smart contract, i. e. the smart contracts' source code written in a high-level programming language corresponds to the bytecode deployed in the Solana blockchain. Moreover, we have published smart contracts' source code written in high-level programming via a public service that can be used by researchers, smart contract developers, and blockchain not-expert users.",

        "Abstract": "Due to current developments it is important that education go hand in hand with technology. Currently, there are several technological devices that allow a more didactic management of learning and beacons are some interesting devices to apply them in education. This paper presents a new methodology for virtual learning environments based on Beacons devices. Specifically, we developed a prototype that allows information to be displayed on a smartphone application. For this, the mobile device communicates with the beacon, which indicates the information that must be displayed in the application. Although any content can be used in this proposal, we show as example the curricular content of an educational center. The proposed prototype takes advantage of the operating principle of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The use of Beacons allows Smartphone-Beacon automated communication. More specifically, a mobile application has been developed in the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of Android Studio, which is responsible for scanning the iBeacon protocol and the automatic generation of the notification that links the end user to a web repository. Prototype tests were carried out on students and encouraging results were obtained. These results demonstrate that the learning process can be improved using our proposal, that is, education-oriented Beacons is an interesting option for internet-of-things (IoT) based education. A systematic review of the literature has not found a solution similar to the one presented.",

        "Abstract": "The proliferation of mobile health technology, or mHealth apps, has necessitated the paramount importance of safeguarding personal health records. These digital platforms afford individuals the ability to effortlessly monitor and manage their health-related issues, as well as store, share, and access their medical records and treatment information. As the utilization of mHealth apps becomes increasingly widespread, it is imperative to ensure that protected health information (PHI) is effectively and securely transmitted, received, created, and maintained in accordance with the regulations set forth by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). However, it is unfortunate to note that many mobile app developers, including those of mHealth apps, are not fully cognizant of the HIPAA security and privacy guidelines. This presents a unique opportunity for research to develop an analytical framework that can aid developers in maintaining a secure and HIPAA-compliant source code, while also raising awareness among consumers about the privacy and security of sensitive health information. The plan is to develop a framework which will serve as the foundation for developing an integrated development environment (IDE) plugin for mHealth app developers and a web-based interface for mHealth app consumers. This will help developers identify and address HIPAA compliance issues during the development process and provide consumers with a tool to evaluate the privacy and security of mHealth apps before downloading and using them. The goal is to encourage the development of secure and compliant mHealth apps that safeguard personal health information.",

        "Abstract": "This case study is about Pocket Code's build variants. Pocket Code is a free and open source integrated development environment (IDE) for the brick based visual programming language Catrobat. It is released in various flavors for different partners and projects (e.g., Create@School, Phiro and Standalone). All flavors use the same code base but slightly differ in design and functionality. If different flavors are maintained as separate projects, all projects require proper maintenance. Any feature introduced or updated in one project must be ported to all others, for that they dont diverge. With an increase in the number of flavors, efforts to maintain will also increase which renders the project unmaintainable. If all flavors are maintained in one project, it is challenging to release more than one version of an application with a different set of functionalities and different user interface (UI) enhancements. In this paper, Pocket Code's different build variants are discussed particularly the standalone build variant. To build a standalone version of any app hosted on the Pocket Code sharing platform, the user has to trigger the build via the web interface on the remote Pocket Code server. Resource files and app configuration are generated based on user input. This paper can be of interest to organizations dealing with dynamic build variants triggered by external actors.",

It runs separately, e.g., on a tablet, beside an integrated development environment. Within the visualization, developers are able to arbitrarily change the object state, then invoke any method with custom parameters and observe how the object state changes. When changing the source code of the related class, the visualization holds the previous object state and adapts the new behavior defined by the underlying source code. This instantly enables developers to observe functionalities objects of a certain class have and how they manipulate their state, and especially, how source code changes influence their behavior. We implemented a first prototype as a touch-enabled web application that is connected to a conventional integrated development environment. In order to gain first practical insights, we evaluated our approach in a pilot user study.",

The designed system contains a central receiver unit with LoRa and ZigBee transceiver modules, a microcontroller, a wireless sensor card with temperature and humidity sensors, LoRa and ZigBee transceiver modules, and a relay unit. The relay in the sensor card can be remotely or cloud-based controlled, and the temperature and humidity data from the sensor can be sent to the central receiver unit by using the ZigBee or LoRa transceiver modules. The microcontroller was configured and programmed by using the evaluation version of STM32CubeMX and Kiel μVision Integrated Development Environment (IDE). PCB designs of the central receiver unit and the wireless sensor card were done by using DipTrace CAD software. Sub-components of the system were manufactured, assembled and tested for its functionality, communication efficiency and range. The practical design and reported results given here are beneficial to communication engineers for low-power, long-range smart Internet of Things (IoT) system applications. Taking advantage of the complementing performances of ZigBee and LoRa wireless technologies, a diversified communication system with smart features is proposed, designed, and tested in a single loT system.",

        "Abstract": "Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. HGrid is a Hadoop data engineering tool made by solusi247 for Map Reduce, Spark and Storm frameworks which has been built since 2011 to help programmers building server-side data processing applications by automatically generate codes based on visually designed workflow. The biggest challenge to build this tool was to make most of the functions, modules, libraries and even workflow schemes (nearly) compatible between frameworks and to make a multipurpose single Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Big Data availlable in the desktop and on the cloud. The development of the HGrid library starts with the collection of functions needed, how they can be implemented in each framework and how the codes can be generated. HGrid generated codes were also benchmarked against some commercially availlable tools to ensure good performance. HGrid is also designed to be visual, robust and user friendly although it still need to be improved in user experience part. It is also designed for average programmers and analysts. Data engineering libraries has been continuosly developed to ease application development with target near zero programming at the programmers side. HGrid has been used largely at the telco operators in Indonesia, in the largest banks, government institutions, hospitals and military to build complex applications such as Data Lake, Mediation Device, Media Analytics and many others.",

        "Abstract": "Study shows that software developers spend about 19% of their time looking for information in the web during software development and maintenance. Traditional web search forces them to leave the working environment (e.g., IDE) and look for information in the web browser. It also does not consider the context of the problems that the developers search solutions for. The frequent switching between web browser and the IDE is both time-consuming and distracting, and the keyword-based traditional web search often does not help much in problem solving. In this paper, we propose an Eclipse IDE-based web search solution that exploits the APIs provided by three popular web search engines-Google, Yahoo, Bing and a popular programming Q & A site, StackOverflow, and captures the content-relevance, context-relevance, popularity and search engine confidence of each candidate result against the encountered programming problems. Experiments with 75 programming errors and exceptions using the proposed approach show that inclusion of different types of contextual information associated with a given exception can enhance the recommendation accuracy of a given exception. Experiments both with two existing approaches and existing web search engines confirm that our approach can perform better than them in terms of recall, mean precision and other performance measures with little computational cost.",

In 2015 the LEGO MindStorms EV3 robots were integrated into these lessons. Looking at this teaching and learning arrangement, the evaluations showed a higher level of undergraduates' motivation, more fun, and more practical relevance, but also some challenges; for instance the problem that the robots are only available in the lab during opening hours. Therefore, a transformer was developed to run an existing EV3 simulation. The plan is now to use a plug-in for integrating this option into the Integrated Development Environment Eclipse as an intermediate stage. In the long term, several developments shall be combined to build a browser-based development environment for programming EV3 robots as well as the self developed EV3 simulation.",

        "Abstract": "With the development and evolution of information technology, cloud-based online programming environments are increasingly preferred by developers, but the current cloud editor platform services generally suffer from deficiencies such as the poor adaptive capacity of resource utilization and imperfect development ecosphere. To address these issues, a new service architecture based on the containerized PAAS(Platform as a service) model was proposed, which has two cores, namely ERAAS(Every-Resources As A Service) ecology management module and ROOP(Resource-Oriented Online Programming) service support module. ERAAS is a new concept defined in this paper and is a type of XAAS(Anything as a Service) in the context of online programming, whose ecosphere includes full-chain resources, and ROOP is an online programming mode that adds support for the ERAAS ecosystem, which can use or create resources. The current vision of architecture has three key designs, supporting developers to customize the resource runtime environment, setting up the ”release” function to build the application ecology, and putting the resource configuration information of released application into the profile pool to provide decision support for the adaptive configuration recommendation, thus transforming the role of developer from the user of the online programming environment to the creator of the online programming ecology and promoting the self-growth and evolution of the online programming ecology to achieve efficient use of resources and improve execution efficiency. However, the architecture proposed in this paper is still not perfect and lacks incentives for ecological activity, and further optimization of the adaptive algorithm is expected.",

        "Abstract": "The software industry has been embracing the multi-cloud infrastructure for the design and adaptation of complex and distributed software systems. This new hybrid cloud infrastructure makes it possible to mix and match platforms and cloud providers for various software development activities. There are several benefits of the multi-cloud infrastructure such as lower level of vendor lock-in and minimize the risk of widespread data loss or downtime. However, it has many challenges such as non-standard and inherent complexity due to different technologies, interfaces, and services. Docker has introduced container-based software development approach in the past few years and gaining popularity in the software industry. It has recently introduced its distributed system development tool called Swarm, which extends the Docker container-based software development process on multiple hosts in multiple clouds without any interoperability issue. Docker Swarm-based distributed software development is a newborn approach for the cloud industry; nonetheless, it has a huge potential to provide multi-cloud development environment without worrying the complexity of it. This paper presents the simulation of building a virtual system of systems (SoS) for the distributed software development process on multiple clouds. This simulation of virtual SoS is based on Docker Swarm, VirtualBox, Mac OS X, nginx and redis. However, the same SoS can be created on any of the Docker supported cloud by just changing the driver name to the desired cloud name such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Digital Ocean, Google Compute Engine, Exoscale, Generic, OpenStack, Rackspace, IBM Softlayer, VMware vCloud Air.",

        "Abstract": "Recent advance in online geospatial analysis shows the promise to adopt an online interactive development environment (IDE). Scripts in IDE can be improved to follow geospatial “recipes” such as geospatial concepts and operators to facilitate online geoprocessing. This could be done by incorporating OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) style APIs into scripts, thus improving the interoperability of scripts across online coding environments in different geospatial cloud platforms. The paper proposes an OGC-oriented interoperable script API called OGEScript. By leveraging the object-oriented design pattern, geospatial resources defined in OGC specifications are mapped to classes within the OGEScript. This mapping allows for a uniform script-based object access to data and processing functions (traditionally in OGC APIs) available in background cloud platforms. Existing scripting languages like Python can be extended to develop such functionality. The approach is implemented in a cloud platform named Open Geospatial Engine (OGE) to demonstrate the applicability of the approach.",

        "Abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) is a worldwide system of “smart devices” that can sense and connect with their surroundings and interact with users and other systems. Global air pollution is one of the major concerns of our era. Existing monitoring systems have inferior precision, low sensitivity, and require laboratory analysis. Therefore, improved monitoring systems are needed. To overcome the problems of existing systems, we propose a three-phase air pollution monitoring system. An IoT kit was prepared using gas sensors, Arduino integrated development environment (IDE), and a Wi-Fi module. This kit can be physically placed in various cities to monitoring air pollution. The gas sensors gather data from air and forward the data to the Arduino IDE. The Arduino IDE transmits the data to the cloud via the Wi-Fi module. We also developed an Android application termed IoT-Mobair, so that users can access relevant air quality data from the cloud. If a user is traveling to a destination, the pollution level of the entire route is predicted, and a warning is displayed if the pollution level is too high.

        "Abstract": "Despite various debugging supports of the existing IDEs for programming errors and exceptions, software developers often look at web for working solutions or any up-to-date information. Traditional web search does not consider the context of the problems that they search solutions for, and thus it often does not help much in problem solving. In this paper, we propose a context-aware meta search tool, Surf Clipse, that analyzes an encountered exception and its context in the IDE, and recommends not only suitable search queries but also relevant web pages for the exception (and its context). The tool collects results from three popular search engines and a programming Q & A site against the exception in the IDE, refines the results for relevance against the context of the exception, and then ranks them before recommendation. It provides two working modes-interactive and proactive to meet the versatile needs of the developers, and one can browse the result pages using a customized embedded browser provided by the tool.",

The vehicle's current location can be traced thereby enabling vehicle recovery. The proposed scheme is designed using arduino uno, SIM808 module with GPS antenna, Relay module, power supply for the system. The IoT infrastructure used was Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Adafruit IO as the cloud provided by Adafruit industries. The Global Positioning System (GPS) antenna measures the current coordinates (longitudes and latitudes) of the vehicle after it has been activated through the IoT cloud. The coordinates can then be viewed using Google Earth. The software design was done using C/C++ programming language and Arduino Integrated Development Environment. A novel feature is the ability to use a Adafruit IO cloud platform via a communication network to monitor position of a stolen vehicle and remotely stop such a vehicle from moving further with unlimited range of network coverage. This makes the device better than IoT implemented with WiFi which only covered 100m.",

Indeed, to reduce development time and integration efforts, this process of service composition requires an effective development environment to facilitate quick and simple composition of Web services, and remains a key challenge to realize the true potential of Web services. While numerous composition approaches have been developed, very little has been done towards providing an Integrated Development Environment to ease the process of composition. In this context, this paper introduces a new incremental approach to service composition engineering and considers the composition global life-cycle, i.e. specifying, composing, verifying, deploying, monitoring, and analyzing to achieve a full governance of the composition.",

        "Abstract": "The incident management process consists of four sequential steps-incident detection, response, clearance and recovery. Each of these components comprises of a number of operations and coordinated decision-making between the agencies involved. The provision of computer based support tools for the personnel involved will help develop appropriate strategies and increase efficiency and expediency. Existing systems are developed on various traditional computing platforms. However, with the advent of World Wide Web and Internet based programming tools such as Java, it is now possible to develop platform independent decision support tools for the incident management agencies. Any agency will be able to use these Web based tools on a computer with a Java enabled browser. Thus, Web based tools offer an invaluable opportunity to develop next generation online decision support tools for real-time traffic management. The major objectives of this paper are: 1. to explore and demonstrate the applicability of Web-based tools for the development of online decision support systems for incident management and, 2. to develop and test a prototype incident management decision support system (DSS) which has most of the capabilities of similar UNIX based DSS. The paper briefly describes the implementation and development of a prototype wide-area incident management support system using Web-based tools. It also describes the implementation architecture and the individual functions of this prototype.",

        "Abstract": "Traditional web search forces the developers to leave their working environments and look for solutions in the web browsers. It often does not consider the context of their programming problems. The context-switching between the web browser and the working environment is time-consuming and distracting, and the keyword-based traditional search often does not help much in problem solving. In this paper, we propose an Eclipse IDE-based web search solution that collects the data from three web search APIs-Google, Yahoo, Bing and a programming Q & A site-StackOverflow. It then provides search results within IDE taking not only the content of the selected error into account but also the problem context, popularity and search engine recommendation of the result links. Experiments with 25 runtime errors and exceptions show that the proposed approach outperforms the keyword-based search approaches with a recommendation accuracy of 96%. We also validate the results with a user study involving five prospective participants where we get a result agreement of 64.28%. While the preliminary results are promising, the approach needs to be further validated with more errors and exceptions followed by a user study with more participants to establish itself as a complete IDE-based web search solution.",

        "Abstract": "Standard desktop computer applications are becoming increasingly sophisticated, allowing competent users to gain greater levels of efficiency through powerful capabilities. Examples are wide ranging - from simple tailoring of Web-browsers so that frequently used links appear on the toolbar, to writing code to customize the behaviour of a word processor. These interface features promise benefits of end-user programming to those who can access them. To help people access these features, many programming environments have been developed to make programming more accessible. Despite this plethora of developmental research, there has been surprisingly little analytical work in characterising and comparing the capabilities of the environments. This paper presents a methodological analysis of programming environments - particularly educational ones - to shine light on how different languages are used to support three fundamental programming activities. The analysis reveals how programming environments use different languages for the three tasks. We discover that programming environments can be more usable by displaying multiple languages for program representation, but only displaying multiple representations risks creating three cognitive gulfs. To avoid these gulfs, our taxonomy describes why every representation must be editable. Our taxonomy also describes why all languages should be animated when a program is executed. We intend this taxonomy and analysis to be useful for anyone who is building or evaluating a programming environment.",

        "Abstract": "Question and Answer (Q&A) services, such as Stack Overflow, rely on a community of programmers who post questions, provide and rate answers, to create what is termed \"crowd knowledge\". As a consequence, these services archive voluminous and potentially useful information to help developers to solve programming-specific issues. Programmers tap into this crowd knowledge through web browsers. This requires them to step out of their integrated development environments (IDE), formulate a query, inspect the returned results and manually port the solution back to the IDE. We present an integrated and largely automated approach to assist programmers who want to leverage the crowd knowledge of Q&A services. We give a form to our approach by implementing Seahawk, an Eclipse plugin. Seahawk automatically formulates queries from the current context in the IDE, and presents a ranked and interactive list of results. Seahawk lets users identify individual discussion pieces and import code samples through simple drag & drop. Users can also link Stack Overflow discussions and source code persistently. We performed an evaluation of Seahawk, with promising results.",

        "Abstract": "Novice programming is a challenging subject to both the students and the educators. A novice programmer is required to acquire new knowledge to solve a problem and propose a solution systematically. This is followed by constructing the solution in a development environment that they are unfamiliar with. This research looks at the challenges faced by a novice programmer and the online methods that are popular to assist the students. Online block programming is a popular option. One of the software that had been implemented in the various research project is Scratch. From the reviewed research, it shows that the trend is moving towards an intelligent tutoring system, where students can have personalized engagement for their learning experience. This paper presents a systematic review conducted using the keywords “novice programming”, “introductory”, “CS1”, “difficulties”, “challenges”, and “threshold concepts”. From the review conducted, it is observed that most of the work is carried out to ease the implementation of the solution through an integrated development environment, and block programming. On the support for instructors, the discussion on curriculum and challenges in CS1 tops the chart. This is followed by active learning through online tools.",

        "Abstract": "The Internet is becoming a de facto standard environment for the operation of most application software. A user (client) of the software uses a browser to operate it while the actual software may be located locally or remotely. Different techniques have evolved with time for implementation of such software within the basic client/server architecture. The initial development environment used a browser (as a client) and a Web server/HTML/CGI (as a server). Of late, technologies like CORBA, DCOM, etc., are becoming popular. Whatever the development environment or implementation technique, such software development is still a tedious job and requires the software developer to be an expert of various technologies. Such scenarios naturally demand a good development tool such that the whole development cycle is small and efficient and the pressure of learning different technologies for a software developer is reduced. We present our effort of designing and implementing such a tool, named IMIS. There are two major components in IMIS: the specification component and the implementation component. In the former, we specify the business process and the latter implements the specification. The core of the specification is the language in which the business process is specified and stored. The implementation component of IMIS will consist of the tools which produce the final customized MIS based on the specification which executes in an Internet/intranet environment.",

        "Abstract": "The prerequisite knowledge regarding Computer Science (CS) varies strongly among freshmen at university and it seems advisable to compensate for these differences before the first lecture starts. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) might represent a possible solution. We therefore designed and developed a MOOC (called “LOOP: Learning Object-Oriented Programming”) which provides a gentle introduction to computational thinking and object-oriented concepts before the programming part. In addition to the common quizzes, we developed various we-based interactive exercises to enable the learners to experiment and interact directly with the presented concepts. Furthermore, we implemented programming exercises with constructive feedback for the learners using a web-based integrated development environment and additionally an automatic grading system. The target group of the course are prospective students of science or engineering that are due to attend CS lessons in their first terms. The course was conducted as a prototype with a limited number of participants. In a concluding survey, the participants submitted textual feedback on the course; some of them proposed specific improvements for the employed interactive exercises. Yet, the overall feedback was encouragingly positive. In this paper, we describe the design and the development of the course, as well as our initial results.",

        "Abstract": "Chatbots are agents that enable the interaction of users and software by means of written or spoken natural language conversation. Their use is growing, and many companies are starting to offer their services via chatbots, e.g., for booking, shopping or customer support. For this reason, many chatbot development tools have emerged, which makes choosing the most appropriate tool difficult. Moreover, there is hardly any support for migrating chatbots between tools. To alleviate these issues, we propose a model-driven engineering solution that includes: (i) a domain-specific language to model chatbots independently of the development tool; (ii) a recommender that suggests the most suitable development tool for the given chatbot requirements and model; (iii) code generators that synthesize the chatbot code for the selected tool; and (iv) parsers to extract chatbot models out of existing chatbot implementations. Our solution is supported by a web IDE called Conga that can be used for both chatbot creation and migration. A demo video is available at https://youtu.be/3sw1FDdZ7XY.",

        "Abstract": "Ever in search of a silver bullet for automated functional testing for Web applications, many folks have turned to Selenium. Selenium is an open-source project for in-browser testing, originally developed by ThoughtWorks and now boasting an active community of developers and users. One of Selenium's stated goals is to become the de facto open-source replacement for proprietary tools such as WinRunner. Of particular interest to the agile community is that it offers the possibility of test-first design of Web applications, red-green signals for customer acceptance tests, and an automated regression test bed for the Web tier. This experience report describes the standard environment for testing with Selenium, as well as modifications we performed to incorporate our script pages into a wiki. It includes lessons we learned about continuous integration, script writing, and using the Selenium Recorder (renamed IDE). We also discuss how long it took to write and maintain the scripts in the iterative development environment, how close we came to covering all of the functional requirements with tests, how often the tests should be (and were) run, and whether additional automated functional testing below the GUI layer was still necessary and/or appropriate. While no silver bullet, Selenium has become a valuable addition to our agile testing toolkit, and is used on the majority of our Web application projects. It promises to become even more valuable as it gains widespread adoption and continues to be actively developed.",

        "Abstract": "Teaching programming using Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is gaining popularity due to their scalability and efficiency of knowledge distribution. However, participating in these courses usually means fully committing to the supplied programming environment in the browser. While this allows a consistent and controllable setup, learners do not gain experience with actual development tools, such as local code editors, testing frameworks, issue trackers or continuous integration (CI) services, which is critical for subsequent real-world projects. Furthermore, the tests for the functionality that is to be developed are oftentimes already available in MOOCs and simply need to be executed, leading to less involvement with developing appropriate tests. In order to tackle these issues while maintaining a high degree of automation and scalability, we developed Prof. CI, a novel approach to conducting online exercises. Prof. CI leverages the existing automation infrastructure that developers use daily, i.e. CI services and Github workflows, to teach test-driven development (TDD) practices. Participants work on their own repositories in Github and receive feedback and new challenges from the CI server when they push their code. We have successfully applied this approach in a pilot project with 30 undergraduate students learning the Ruby on Rails web development framework. Our evaluation shows that the exercise effectively increased students' motivation to write tests for their code. We also present the results of participant surveys, students' experiences and teachers' observations.",

I have summarized some of my initial steps towards understanding and supporting Web EUP, specifically support for end-user mashups. One possibility for making Web information tasks more flexible and efficient for end users may be Web mashups hybrid Web applications that integrate multiple information sources into a single interface. Mashups can provide users with a new view of information that is readily available online. While the mashup integration technique allows programmers to generate novel or unanticipated ways to collect and work with online information, average Web users do not have the skills necessary to find and incorporate the many available online data sources. Most Web development tools assume at least some programming background, although tools aimed at end users are beginning to emerge.",

        "Abstract": "Cloud computing solutions have quickly become a hot topic in information technology circles. The proliferation of high performance, reliable and secure internet infrastructure, along with new, rich web development tools and technologies has meant that for the first time software can be hosted in a purely web based context. Many of the traditional software packages (especially business packages) that have historically been installed and used on local computers for decades are slowly but surely appearing online. The trend is undeniable and it is now not unreasonable to speculate that most business software packages will be purely web based in the not too distant future. With this centralisation of software, comes considerable management problems. These problems stem from the astronomical scale of the data centres that operate Cloud Computing solutions. This paper suggests a new declarative language framework that might address these management problems by automating the deployment and day to day operation of cloud computing solutions.",

        "Abstract": "During software development and maintenance, developers spend a considerable amount of time on program comprehension activities. Previous studies show that program comprehension takes up as much as half of a developer's time. However, most of these studies are performed in a controlled setting, or with a small number of participants, and investigate the program comprehension activities only within the IDEs. However, developers' program comprehension activities go well beyond their IDE interactions. In this paper, we extend our ActivitySpace framework to collect and analyze Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) data across many applications (not just the IDEs). We follow Minelli et al.'s approach to assign developers' activities into four categories: navigation, editing, comprehension, and other. We then measure the comprehension time by calculating the time that developers spend on program comprehension, e.g., inspecting console and breakpoints in IDE, or reading and understanding tutorials in web browsers. Using this approach, we can perform a more realistic investigation of program comprehension activities, through a field study of program comprehension in practice across a total of seven real projects, on 78 professional developers, and amounting to 3,148 working hours. Our study leverages interaction data that is collected across many applications by the developers. Our study finds that on average developers spend ~58 percent of their time on program comprehension activities, and that they frequently use web browsers and document editors to perform program comprehension activities. We also investigate the impact of programming language, developers' experience, and project phase on the time that is spent on program comprehension, and we find senior developers spend significantly less percentages of time on program comprehension than junior developers. Our study also highlights the importance of several research directions needed to reduce program comprehension time, e.g., building automatic detection and improvement of low quality code and documentation, construction of software-engineering-specific search engines, designing better IDEs that help developers navigate code and browse information more efficiently, etc.",

It is mainly applied on the World Wide Web, and can be easily installed in any Java integrated development environment and extended to more utilized fields, furthermore, virtual reality simulation on WWW, as the further development of this system, is discussed and an M/M/2 queuing system is also given to show the prospects.",

        "Abstract": "The evolution of Web technologies leads to software premature obsolescence requiring technology-independent representations to increase the reuse rates during the development process. They also require integration into service-oriented architectures to exchange information with different Web systems supporting runtime interoperability. Web Applications (WebApps) run on devices with different capabilities and limitations increasing the complexity of the development process. To address these challenges, different proposals have emerged to facilitate the development of WebApps, which is still an open research field with many challenges to address. This paper presents a model transformation architecture based on software standards to automatically generate full stack multi-layered WebApps covering Persistence, Service, and Presentation layers. This transformation architecture also generates the set of test cases to test WebApp business logic. The proposed transformation architecture only requires a UML platform-independent class model as an input to generate fully functional Web applications in a three-tier architecture including the three layers, while most proposals focus on the generation of the Presentation layer. In addition, this architecture employs software industry standards to enable an easy integration into third-party tools and development environments. The transformation Architecture proposed has been empirically validated on the case study of a fully functional travel management WebApp that is generated using a UML class diagram employing a third-party tool integrated into the same integrated development environment.",

To save developers the time required to switch from their development environments to a web browser in the quest for a suitable code snippet, we introduce NLP2Code, a content assist for code snippets. Unlike related tools, NLP2Code integrates directly into the source code editor and provides developers with a content assist feature to close the vocabulary gap between developers' needs and code snippet meta data. Our preliminary evaluation of NLP2Code shows that the majority of invocations lead to code snippets rated as helpful by users and that the tool is able to support a wide range of tasks.",

        "Abstract": "During the software development process, developers are often faced with problem solving situations. For instance, it is common the occurrence of exceptions, that originate stack traces in the Console View of the IDE. These situations motivate the developer to use the Web to search for information. However, there is a gap between the IDE and the Web, requiring developers to spend significant time searching for relevant information and navigating through web pages in a Web browser. We propose to process the information of exception stack traces and retrieve question-answering web resources to help developers. We developed a tool that integrates recommendation of question/answer web resources in Eclipse, according to the context of these exception stack traces. The results of a preliminary experimentation are promising, showing that our approach performs better than a simple keyword-based approach.",

Each distributed environment combines different technologies and standards for publishing, searching and communicating with its information services. For cross-environment application development and deployment, the differing technologies and standards present a serious hurdle. This work describes the initial stage of a project called the Universal Information Service Browser (UISB). The UISB defines a framework for browsing and interacting with a number of information services, such as UDDI and the Jini Lookup Service. This framework is implemented within an integrated development environment called Eclipse. We have organised the paper as follows: part one examines the problem area, our motivation, and potential solutions. The second part of the paper briefly details and outlines the UISB architecture and technical infrastructure. The third and fourth sections discuss the architecture and implementation work that we have accomplished so far. Finally we summarise our early experiences and outline future work.",

As such, the software component — of ICT — is lacking a good and attentive construction to these functioning details which, often, are of difficult assessment. Adding to these constrains, the existing information is, not exclusively but especially, focused on Web contents. Attending to these matters, a checklist of proposals has been elaborated, and presented in this paper, that tries to cover these flaws, allowing for an evaluation of the accessibility of Integrated Development Environments (IDE), their capacity of generating accessible software — native software and not Web contents — and even the accessibility of the final product — the native software. Conceived through the reutilization and inspired on the general knowledge created by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), the drafts of this checklist are easily understandable and applicable. With the objective of facilitating the work of information systems technician who may already have concerns regarding these topics, it further has the important potential of encouraging agents to initiate themselves into the cares that this are requires.",

        "Abstract": "Systems understanding is a skill required to solve many of the world’s most important problems, from climate change to immunotherapy to social decision-making. However, these problems also require communication among experts with diverse skill sets and academic backgrounds. Our long-term goal is to facilitate systems understanding across a range of disciplines through end-user computational modeling tools. This paper presents the Ceptre Editor, a structure editor for the rule-based programming language Ceptre. The Ceptre Editor runs in the browser and offers a visual interface and integrated development environment for Ceptre, following design recommendations from end-user programming, with the goal of providing discoverable affordances for program construction and maintaining syntactic well-formedness at each edit state. We performed a preliminary evaluation of the tool through a qualitative study, assessing the editors effectiveness at helping users understand and extended a system model, and found promising results regarding learnability and mental model accuracy.",

        "Abstract": "A digital X-ray library system is vital for an academic radiology department. Existing commercial solutions for creating image collections are often not suitable for radiologic applications. For these reasons, we developed our own digital archive system and image collection database system. We chose a database development tool that allows rapid design and development of multimedia, user-friendly programs supporting Web-based applications. With this software, we developed the three main functions of our system: a. Data import function fully integrated with our different modalities. b. Data editing by means of simple and powerful management software, which is connected to the database server remotely. c. Data sharing and distribution on the viewing stations with the ability to create stand-alone CD-ROMs and with a Web server for online access by using any Web browser. The system implemented was adopted by all of our department members, and the growth of database content was clear evidence of the success and acceptance of the system by the users. Storage of selected interesting cases in the image databases will become a natural and common trend among our radiologists during their daily clinical routine.",

        "Abstract": "Machine Learning, a subset of Artificial Intelligence, is now being integrated into image and speech classification, object and action recognition, medical image analysis, security and surveillance, and autonomous driving. It is usually executed by creating a neural network which is defined as the process of modeling a computer system to mimic the function of the human brain. However, learning to develop a neural network is a challenge for students, especially those who have little background in programming. This study focuses on developing a node-based programming tool called NodalNet, a beginner-friendly and interactive educational tool for creating a neural network designed for image classification applications. Java programming language, Java swing library, and Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE) are used to build the NodalNet. It can be used for offline deployment using laptops, and computers, and for online deployment using a technique called the application programming interface (API) method. NodalNet has built-in components that can be connected through nodes, and it has a data labeling feature that helps the users in classifying the raw data inputs used before the training process. The NodalNet can develop and train simple neural networks, some image recognition samples are FlowerNET, DogCatNET, and NumberNET which have significant results in their accuracy. A survey conducted shows that 77.78% of the respondents answered that it is easy to train using the NodalNet. This tool offers a positive impact as an interactive educational tool for developing a neural network.",

        "Abstract": "Setting up an infrastructure for application deployment is a non-trivial task. We usually simplify the task by using the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach. Through IaC we set-up software defined infrastructure, able to run applications. Several tools and platforms have been developed to describe the system and to implement the actual deployment of the application (e.g., Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Terraform, etc.). When the infrastructure is heterogeneous (e.g., combination of Cloud and HPC) the challenges to set up a collaborative infrastructure is even harder, as the paradigms and environments differ significantly. Cloud infrastructure is focusing on servers, events, functions, while the HPC infrastructure is procedural and takes the application and merely executes it, usually on bare metal. As expected, the applications deployed on the respective systems differ in their dynamics and longevity. Whilst deployment of applications on the Cloud can be solved with the aforementioned tools, the HPC systems are in this respect in their infancy � the application is usually scheduled to be executed on a pre-defined set of processors and from that point on, the scripts merely gather input data, execute the application and then organize the output data. Merging the two approaches is thus currently rather hard and requires an explicit boundary between the Cloud and HPC parts of the application, posing a significant issue for the overall modelling and thus set-up of the system with the IaC approach. SODALITE, an H2020 project, is targeting simplification of the application deployment complexity while retaining or improving application performance on targeted HPC heterogeneous and cloud systems. The application deployment is abstracted through modelling of application's component relationships, policies and performance. The application is deployed using appropriate container technologies, matching the targeted heterogeneous HPC and cloud-based platforms. The starting point is the definition of the system and the application within an AI-supported IDE, using a straightforward, TOSCA-similar language. The smart IDE backed with the Graph DB knowledge base supports the user with the suggestions on how the system and application could (or should) be modelled. In the next general step, this definition is executed through an orchestrator, resulting in an execution of the application within the software-defined environment. In cases where the source code is available, it is optimised for the targeted infrastructure before execution. This step ensures that the application performance is not lost due to abstraction. However, in all cases, the execution of the application is monitored, as SODALITE is using machine learning and controltheory approaches to improve runtime performance. SODALITE is currently in the middle of its development thus not all of its functionalities are available. Whilst we first addressed the typical private Cloud infrastructures (e.g. OpenStack) and HPC (e.g. Torque job scheduler) using containers to encapsulate the applications, there is still work to be done to address public Clouds (e.g. AWS) and other HPC schedulers (e.g. Slurm). The IDE is functional, however it still requires further improvements and enhancements. Finally, not all optimisation approaches are developed at the moment. The aim of the proposed approach is to flatten the learning curve for Ops enabling them to concentrate on domain problems, resulting in lower overall costs of development and application lifecycle management.",

        "Abstract": "Summary form only given. The World Wide Web serves as an efficient medium for administering software and hardware courses. In particular, the Web may be utilized to create a constructive dialogue between course instructor and students, that not only serves to reinforce and complement class material, but that also leads to a paperless exchange of information. From the instructor's course management standpoint, lecture notes, handouts, transparencies, project specifications, class grades, course-related links and direct access to e-mail and news group facilities for conducting online course-related discussions, can all be made available to the student via the instructor's homepage. The students, on the other hand, can make their hardware or software design reports (including project-related links) available to the instructor and other students in the class via their own homepages. This paper describes several experiences in conducting web-based paperless instructor-student dialogue in software and hardware design courses. Particular emphasis is placed on discussing: (1) the circular flow of information between instructor and student; (2) the main components of the instructor's homepage; (3) the main components of the student's homepages; (4) the effective use of course-specific newsgroups; (5) the paperless grading of course assignments; (6) privacy issues; and (7) some WWW development tools and browser plug-ins that helped in the construction of the instructor-student information exchange structure.",

        "Abstract": "OutSystems provides a model-driven low-code development environment and delivery platform that allows developers to create enterprise-grade web and mobile applications. OutSystems developers interact with Service Studio, the platform’s IDE, using domain-specific visual languages to shape the fine-grained application model.In recent years, OutSystems introduced the “Application Builders”, a set of tools that lower the learning curve even more and provide an inclusive entrance to non-IT developers. The builders focus on specific application development scopes such as User Experience or the definition of Business Processes. Each application domain requires a specific and appropriate meta-model abstracting selected parts of the underlying OutSystems model. Ultimately, they represent OutSystems concepts in a higher degree of abstraction, just like views of the base model.OutSystems builders define a unidirectional model transformation strategy. This limitation hinders the interoperability between the different development tools in the OutSystems ecosystem. An application developed with one particular builder is unreadable in other builders and can only be further customized in Service Studio. However, changes made in the IDE are irreversible and unreadable by the original builder. This comes off as a direct consequence of the current problem of OutSystems builders defining unidirectional model transformations.In this paper, we explicitly address this limitation by defining fully bidirectional builder model transformations in OutSystems: builder to IDE and IDE to builder. The implemented strategy consists of a synchronization algorithm that maintains consistency between models on all allowed evolutions, thus leading to the point where builders become model editors.The instantiated and evaluated implementation focuses on one particular builder of OutSystems, the “Experience Builder”. We successfully represented all Service Studio operations that become either invisible or correctly mapped onto the builder’s model. In addition, it was possible to portray evolution steps taken in the builder tool without reverting the customization made in Service Studio.",

        "Abstract": "In the agricultural domain, the main challenge is to present the new information and research to the farmers so that they can leverage the power of ICT to improve their agricultural practices and thereby the production. Huge amount of agriculture related data like weather data, soil health records, cropping pattern, location specific crop disease and pest are collected from different sources like services, remote satellites, and network of sensors. An agro advisory system presented in this paper helps to bridge the gap between farmers and the agriculture domain experts and developed for the cotton farmers in Gujarat region of India. The system consists of three basic components; Cotton Ontology, Web Services, and Mobile Application Development. The cotton ontology maintains domain knowledge required for answering farmer queries. The ontology contains information regarding crop, soil, cultivation process, disease, pest, and other relevant information. Protégé ontology development tool is used to develop this ontology. Appropriate Web services were built which help interactions with different data sources. The RESTful Web services are programmed in Java using the JAX-RS/Jersey API and the Eclipse EE IDE. The services are developed and deployed on a cloud based application server provided by Heroku. The Web services are invoked from the mobile device and in turn they connect to various data sources like Open Weather API, SQL database and the Ontologies. The farmers can use this application based on very simple android mobile interfaces. The prototype is developed using Java, Android SDK - v14 and Eclipse IDE.",

        "Abstract": "Automatic detection of programmer difficulty can help programmers receive timely assistance. Aggregate statistics are often used to evaluate difficulty detection algorithms, but this paper demonstrates that a more human-centered analysis can lead to additional insights. We have developed a novel visualization tool designed to assist researchers in improving difficulty detection algorithms. Assuming that data exists from a study in which both predicted programmer difficulties and ground truth were recorded while running an online algorithm for detecting difficulties, the tool allows researchers to interactively travel through a timeline showing the correlation between values of the features used to make predictions, difficulty predictions made by the online algorithm, and ground truth. We used the tool to improve an existing online algorithm based on a study involving the development of a GUI in Java. Episodes of difficulty predicted by the previously developed algorithm were correlated with features extracted from participant logs of interaction with the programming environment and web browser. The visualizations produced from the tool contribute to a better understanding of programmer actions during periods of difficulty, help to identify specific issues with the previous prediction algorithm, and suggest potential solutions to these issues. Thus, the information gained using this novel tool can be used to improve algorithms that help developers receive assistance at appropriate times.",

        "Abstract": "Farmers are becoming increasingly worried about protecting their cattle because animal health and well-being are essential. Furthermore, monitoring the state of animals on a daily basis is complicated because workers lack the time to examine animals and detect early signs of sickness, and environmental conditions have such an effect on cattle health. The proposed system consists of sensors and microcontroller, cloud, and an android application for maintaining the cattle shed environment, regulating livestock health, and environmental conditions. The sensors monitor and collect environmental parameters such as temperature, soil moisture, fire detection, rain level, and gas values. The ESP32 microcontroller is utilized, and the Esp32Sensor component provides access to the Esp32 board’s in- targeted sensors. To configure the ESP32, the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is utilized. The data is processed entirely in the ESP32 microcontroller using embedded C. The DHT11 sensor detects temperature using Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) and sends serial data to the ESP32 through the Data port. The ESP32 monitors the temperature, and, if the threshold is exceeded, the cooling fan connected via the relay is activated. The soil moisture sensor provides an analog output pin that emits voltage that is proportional to its moisture level. ESP32 activates a pump to irrigate the plants when the level is low. Raindrop Sensors are made up of two parts: a raindrop module that detects whether or not it is raining and a control board that processes data from the raindrop module by translating resistance into a voltage drop between the analog pin and ground. The MQ2 gas sensor detects methane. The MQ2 gas sensor generates output determined by a specified threshold through the potentiometer and the operating voltage of the microcontroller via LM393 dual comparator. Google Firebase, which aids in real- time tracking, is linked to the ESP32. The Firebase ESP Client library is used in the Arduino IDE. Google FireBase is coupled with the Android app. Using the mobile application, the farmer can access this data from anywhere and at any time. In the event of an anomaly, the farmer is notified via the end-user application",

        "Abstract": "A range of new kind of applications are growing for the integration of different technologies and needs such as IoT/IoE (Internet of Things/Everything), WoT (web of things), Digital twins and smart data models, data spaces. These applications demand less attention to the storage modeling since the adopted big data stores are less structured. Therefore, the connection from data storage to visual representation can be more automated. All these aspects open the path for rapid prototyping. In this paper a fast-prototyping development lifecycle for that category of smart applications is proposed. The proposed solution works on heterogeneous data types, push and pull, wide interoperability, covering all aspects from data ingestion to front-end. It can be regarded as a specific declination of AGILE development paradigm in which several activities have been strongly shortened by exploiting a number of modelling facilities of the development environment and technologies. The proposed development lifecycle was defined and tuned for the Snap4City platform, which provides an integrated development environment for rapid prototyping of smart application based on low coding, including visual programming, and a number of visual tools for creating the applications. The solution has been validated in the context of multiple interconnected scenarios of several large-scale projects and pilots such as Herit-Data, Panacea, Resolute, Replicate, TRAFAIR, etc.",

Our model, which we dubbed CostHat, supports both, Microservices deployed on traditional IaaS or PaaS clouds, and services that make use of novel cloud programming paradigms, such as AWS Lambda. CostHat is based on a network model, and allows for what-if and cost sensitivity analysis. Further, we have used this model to implement tooling that warns cloud developers directly in the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) about certain classes of potentially costly code changes. We illustrate our work based on a case study, and evaluate the CostHat model using a standalone Python implementation. We show that, once instantiated, cost calculation in CostHat is computationally inexpensive on standard hardware (below 1 ms even for applications consisting of thousand services and endpoints). This enables its use in real-time for developer tooling which continually re-evaluates the costs of an application in the background, while the developer is working on the code.",

Also Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) can increase their competitiveness by taking advantage of CC. This new computing approach promises to provide many advantages, and many SMEs are encouraged to use it. However, CC is still in its early stage - for this reason we think that it is very important to study and assess its impact on SMEs' management processes. In this paper we propose a model for studying how Global Software Development can be facilitated using Cloud development environments, compared to a more traditional development environment. We use system dynamics to model and simulate how effective Cloud-based software development environments are for Global Software Development performed by a SMEs. Both studied environments assume a development process based on Scrum agile methodology. The proposed model could be used as a tool by the project managers to understand how Cloud Development Environments might facilitate Global Software Development.",

        "Abstract": "Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Developer interaction data is a rich trove of information that can be analysed and mined to better comprehend developer activities and which in turn shed light into their pain points and needs and empower developers to perform their tasks more effectively and/or efficiently. Interaction data can be obtained by tracking developer activities in IDE and also related tools that developers regularly use to accomplish their day-to-day tasks (e.g., web browser). Mining and analysis of developer interaction data is a relatively young topic in the area of mining software repositories (MSR). And as such, it is now an exciting time where there are much challenges to address and opportunities to tap on.This talk highlights several of our recent work which is part of the exciting community-wide effort to tackle challenges and take advantage of the potentials of mining developer interaction data. In particular, this talk, which is divided into 3 parts, highlights how developer interaction data can be mined to (1) comprehend how developers understand programs, (2) comprehend how developers search the web, and (3) empower developers to create interactive video tutorials. In the first part, I’ll describe our field study of program comprehension in practice by analysing developer interaction data within and outside IDE across a total of seven real projects, on 78 professional developers, and amounting to 3,148 working hours. In the second part, I describe our mixed-method study based on collecting search queries from 60 developers’ interaction data and surveying 235 software engineers from more than 21 countries across five continues to understand what developers frequently search for and of the search tasks that they often find challenging. In the final part, I describe our work that design and build a programming video tutorial authoring system that that leverages operating system level instrumentation to log workflow history while tutorial authors are creating programming videos, and the corresponding tutorial watching system that enhances the learning experience of video tutorials by providing programming-specific workflow history and timeline-based browsing interactions.Aside from methodologies and findings, opportunities in terms of open technical problems and potential benefits of mining developer interaction data will also be discussed. Hopefully, the talk would inspire attendees to continue innovating in this exciting research topic.",

        "Abstract": "An emerging concept of today's cloud is aPaaS (application PaaS), which combines the ready-to-use software services of SaaS, application serving and development functionality of PaaS, and a convenient marketplace for the developed applications. The integrated development environment of an aPaaS usually provides drag-and-drop application creation and script embedding user interfaces to develop software that will be marketed and served within the same cloud. Yet, enabling application developers embed scripts or instantiate objects brings up security issues as deliberate or accidental actions may threat any cloud stakeholder during development or execution. The paper presents practical solutions to inspect tenants' software in the runtime in terms of object instantiation, method calls and CPU load generation. In the prototype implementation, object instantiation and method calls are managed to regulate access to critical file system or socket resources. Also, CPU load generated by each tenant is monitored to detect possible malicious or erroneous activity, which allows to free the CPU resources when necessary. According to the simulation results based on the prototype implementation, running the mentioned security mechanisms adds an overhead up to 20%, which is an acceptable absolute value around 2 ms, to the web applications served in the cloud in idle and normal load conditions. The mechanisms are scalable as the overhead relatively decreases with the increasing number of concurrent users.",

        "Abstract": "Monitoring software developer's interactions in an integrated development environment is sought for revealing new information about developers and developed software. In this paper we present an approach for identifying potential source code dependencies solely from interaction data. We identify three kinds of potential dependencies and additionally assign them to developer's activity as well, to reveal detailed task-related connections in the source code. Interaction data as a source allow us to identify these candidates for dependencies even for dynamically typed programming languages, or across multiple languages in the source code. After first evaluations and positive results we continue with collecting data in professional environment of Web developers, and evaluating our approach.",

        "Abstract": "One of software developers' most important activities is exploring the broader context of a certain programming task, which strongly requires navigating source code and working out a mental model of the collected information. Without tool support, creating and maintaining this mental model leads to significant cognitive load because developers have to handle both relating relevant source code entities to their mental model as well as remembering already explored search paths. Furthermore, the opposite direction, that is, recalling relevant facts out of the mental model, and subsequently, seeking corresponding entities within the source code, demands similar cognitive efforts. In this paper, we introduce Code Basket, an approach for making developers' mental model visible and explorable. As for that, Code Basket helps developers keeping their mental model persistent by providing a two-dimensional canvas on which they can freely arrange visual representations of source code entities, named eggs. Since those eggs are linked to the underlying source code, eventually, they can be used for navigating directly to related source code entities. We implemented a first prototype as a touch-enabled web application that is connected to a conventional integrated development environment. In order to get early feedback on our approach, we used Code Basket within a formative study.",

        "Abstract": "The paper describes JessGUI, a graphical user interface developed on top of the Jess expert system shell. Jess, although powerful as rule engine, lacks graphical environment that would facilitate its usage and made it more accepted between knowledge-based systems' developers. The central idea behind JessGUI project was to make building, revising, updating, and testing Jess-based expert systems easier, more flexible, and more user-friendly. There are many other expert system building tools providing a rich and comfortable integrated development environment to expert system builders. However, they are all either commercial or proprietary products. Jess and JessGUI are open-source freeware, and yet they are well-suited for building even complex expert system applications, both stand-alone and Web-based ones. Another important feature of JessGUI is its capability of saving knowledge bases in XML format (in addition to the original Jess format), thus making them potentially easy to interoperate with other knowledge bases on the Internet.",

This proved to be particularly difficult for those who were scheduled to learn basic C++ programming, not only the inperson support by their teachers is invaluable in these early stages of learning, but many of them did not have access to adequate hardware or software. A web-based integrated development environment (WebIDE) was deployed, and a number of sample assignments were created. Altogether, over 130 students from 5 schools participated actively, solving a total of 65 assignments (as of June 1st). Based on questionnaire results, overall the experiment was deemed successful, and the continued use of WebIDE after life returns to normal was justified.",

This in turn leads to tracking (navigating) for the URL and its content. The term “Locators” can be described as an address that identifies a web element uniquely that is no repeatable within the webpage, It's a command that informs Selenium Integrated Development Environment which Graphical User Interface elements like - Text Box, Buttons, Check Boxes etc, it needs to operate on. Detecting correct GUI elements is a prior work for generating an automation script but, precise identification of GUI elements is much more difficult. Sometimes, you might even end up working with incorrect GUI elements or no elements at all, therefore, using the right locator ensures that the tests are faster, more reliable, or has lower maintenance over releases.",

When we ask the server for information using Node.js about a component written in a web-based client, the server passes the data to the client in the form of a text file and builds a simulator based on the received data. The components provided by the server are classified into two types according to the characteristics of the IoT and neuromorphic system. The first I-component is an IoT-enabled component and receives the output value of the sensor in real time. The second X-component and the NA component are intelligent components that support the neuromorphic system. It loads the data set, trains the component for object recognition and classification, and evaluate it and displays the results. Probe components can be connected to any point except the final output to determine the value at that point. It can be set the type, time, simulation widget and more in the properties of each component to effectively visualize the changing values by graphs, images, and audio through simulators.",

        "Abstract": "The architecture of classic productivity software are moving from a traditional desktop-based software to a client server architecture hosted in the Cloud. In this context, web browsers behave as application containers that allow users to access a variety of Cloud-based applications and services, such as IDEs, Word processors, Music Collection Managers, etc. As a result, a significant part of these software run in the browser and accesses remote services. A lesson learned from development framework used in distributed applications is the success of pluggable architecture pattern as a core architecture concept, i.e., a Software Architecture that promotes the use of Pluggable Module to dynamically plug. Following this trend, this paper discusses the main challenges to create a component-based platform supporting the development of dynamically adaptable single web page applications. This paper also presents an approach called KevoreeJS based on models@runtime to control browser as component platform which address some of these challenges. We validate this work by presenting the design of a dashboard for sensor based system and highlighting the capacity of KevoreeJS to dynamically choose the placement of code on the server or client side and how KevoreeJS can be used to dynamically install or remove running components.",

        "Abstract": "In the modern world, airlines play a vital role for transporting people and goods on time. Any delay in the timings of these flights can adversely affect the work and business of thousands of people at any given moment. Forecasting these delays is very important during the planning process in commercial airlines. Several techniques have already been proposed for designing models to forecast the delay in departure time of aircraft. But because of the continuously increasing complexity of the airplane transportation and the amount of data related to it, designing accurate prediction methods has become very difficult. In this paper we utilise the method of logistic regression which is a supervised learning method to predict delay in departure times of aircraft. We utilise the Microsoft Azure Learning Studio platform which is an Integrated Development Environment for utilizing machine learning for training and testing the model on the cloud. We also join weather data such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, dew point along with the airport data to derive more accurate predictions as well as find out the effect of weather changes in flight delays. Our method was able to achieve about 80 percent accuracy in predicting whether a given aircraft would be delayed or not based on the training using past data.",

We use Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language) to construct the Soft IP of the NTOU_LF1826 RISC MCU with ICD architecture and go through emulation verification under ModelSim environment. Altera DE10 board and ICD software platform are used to verify the FPGA results. Furthermore, by using the Cell-Based design flow and Taiwan Semiconductor Research Institute (TSRI) EDA cloud platform, VLSI implementation of the RISC MCU under the TSMC 0.18 µm CMOS technology reveal that the size is 1190 × 1190 μm and clock rate is 100 MHz. The two main parts of the NTOU_LF1826 MCU with ICD, the hardware and software are presented in this study. For software, we develop an ICD in-circuit debugger that allows users to observe internal registers immediately. In terms of hardware, we provide two modes, Debug and Run. Under Run mode, the MCU processes as usual, while under Debug mode, the in-circuit debugger has functions such as Reset, Step Into, Step Over, Read Register, and Write Register, five main functions. Communication of software and hardware is conducted by using the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) protocol. NTOU_LF1826 MCU has Run mode as default to properly execute programs. Therefore, the proposed NTOU_LF1826 RISC MCU VLSI architecture and integrated development environment enable users to easily use the RISC MCU.",

        "Abstract": "This paper proposes a new proof-of-storage algorithm for decentralized cloud systems. The algorithm allows an untrusted host to prove data storage and integrity, while the auditing host receives reliable proof of data storage and integrity. The algorithm is based on time-distributed random sampling of data segments from the checked file, their conversion and comparison with the original. The algorithm is implemented in an integrated development environment, analyzed the accuracy of the algorithm, performance and tamper resistance. The efficiency of the algorithm is compared with the Merkle cryptographic protocol and the \"seed planting\" method currently used in decentralized storage systems. The proposed algorithm, in contrast to the considered algorithms, provides evidence of data storage without resource-intensive operations, such as dividing files into parts, calculating checksums of these parts, and transferring parts to the checking host. Hacking resistance is evaluated by calculating the probability of a successful \"brute-force\" attack. The algorithm showed high-performance and high hacking resistance.",

This paper focus on the development of a web-based home automation communication interface employing the ThingSpeak platform as the cloud interfacing service, an Arduino board as the microcontroller, and the ESP8266 as the internet module. The subsystem components were tested using hardware testing circuits and a software code written using Arduino IDE to determine the standard operating procedure and results show that they all conform to the operating standards. When the PIR sensor was tested a voltage of 0 V was measured on the digital pin 2 of the Arduino when no motion is detected and a voltage of 3.25 V when motion is detected. The MQ7 sensor gave a reading of 1.73 V on the analog data pin when not exposed to CO (carbon monoxide) and a reading of 3.25 V when exposed to CO.",

        "Abstract": "Vertical farming is the practice of planting the plants in vertically stacked layers which optimize the land usage as it can be implemented in an indoor environment. The main idea of vertical farming is to use a controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) technology, where all environmental factors can be controlled. Therefore, in this project, an automatic system, which consists of the Internet of Thing [IoT] is implemented in providing the controlled environment for the vertical farming. The main purpose of this project is to build a system to monitor the soil moisture and to control water content through the web browser on the laptop, mobile phone and other handheld and compact devices. In this project, a soil moisture sensor is used to detect the moisture or water content of the soil in the vertical farm so that the plant can be consecutively monitored and controlled to have enough water. When low moisture level is detected, the signals are sent to the Arduino platform. Then, the data is stored eventually in the Arduino IDE software and simultaneously sent to the web browser through the Ethernet that is connected to the internet router. The user can monitor their plant through the web browser that allows them to read the status of the soil moisture and can control the water valve to release the water to the plant whenever the reading is low or necessary. With this development, the monitoring of the vertical farming has been so helpful and the growth of the plant can be supervised from time to time without having the operator at the event.",

The introduction of the Web 2.0 resulted in further changes creating an interactive, community driven platform. However, these ongoing changes have yet to be reflected in the way we document software systems. Documentation generators, like Doxygen and its derivatives (Javadoc, Natural Docs, etc.) have become the de-facto industry standards for creating external technical software documentation from source code. However, the inter-woven representation of source code and documentation within a source code editor limits the ability of these approaches to provide rich media, internationalization, and interactive content. In this paper, we combine the functionality of a Web browser with a source code editor to provide source code documentation with rich media content. The paper presents our fully functional implementation of the editor within the Eclipse framework.",

        "Abstract": "In this research paper a prototype using IOT-based Low-power wide-area network (LoRaWAN) and Sigfox technology was developed for the energy efficient management in smart homes and a study was made on possible consumer interaction solutions, using Python 3.7 and various Internet of Things web platforms. Another objective, to compare the Sigfox prototype with LoRa technology, is also achieved. It is concluded that Sigfox, because of its limitations, cannot be the only technology used in a smart home. LoRa technology, while o□ering more freedom of use, has a more di□cult and complex implementation and is still behind on the simplicity o□ered by the Sigfox infrastructure. The main objective of this work is to develop a smart home system using LPWAN IoT technologies. As increasingly more things become connected to the internet, the Internet of Things is becoming a reality faster than expected. Smart homes, a setting in which the IoT is predicted to have a high impact on the betterment of everyday lives, is a topic of high interest. Allied to other technological advances like cloud computing, machine learning, and miniaturization, the Internet of Things is turning devices away from performing taxing computing skills. Here, low power wide area networks are vital, providing energy e□cient devices at low costs. Sigfox and LoRa are two significant players in this field. This work provides an overview on several of these topics and a basic understanding regarding an IoT project, and brings innovation by building a IoT smart home project from its most basic stage, the devices from which information is captured, to the very last, where through the use of Python integrated development environment (IDE) and IoT platforms a customer may use the information for their gain.",

        "Abstract": "To reach the idea of data science for the Internet of Things (IoT) innovation, we believe that if we can collect data from our daily life activities such as our commuting data from a bus system based on IoT. We can add values to this collected data using, for example, machine learning or data analysis and statistics. However, we need to enable the system to be able to measure our daily life's activities. As an example of such a system, this research demonstrates how to apply the IoT technology to track an electrical bus status of a mass transit system in a university. We develop a mobile application to show the information of the bus on a smartphone. The information can be alerted to a user or passenger in real-time. This information includes an estimated waiting time until the bus reaches a user, the number of passengers on board, and the current bus's position on the route in Google Maps. The mobile application can help a passenger to decide and manage the right journeys to travel in the university. The application was developed on the Android platform with many technologies including an Arduino integrated development environment or IDE, Google Maps application programming interface or API, a global positioning system or GPS module, ThingSpeak cloud, and infrared distance sensors. The 30 passengers evaluated the satisfaction survey. The survey mainly includes the accuracy of the tracking and alerting processes. The results are that the passengers were delighted with the processes. The evaluation related values are following. The mean is 4.91, and the standard deviation or SD is 0.29 or representing as 98.20%. To sum up, the application in this research can provide an example of mobile application development with current and available technologies such as IoT and cloud in the disruptive era to enhance applications in a transportation or others domain.",

Huge indoor auditorium does not have proper ventilation for air flow so when the auditorium is crowded the carbon di-oxide is emitted and it stays there for many days this may be a chance to spreading of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Without proper ventilation virus may present in the indoor auditorium. In the proposed system, emissions are detected by air, noise, and dust sensors. If the signal limit is exceeded, a warning is given to the authorities via an Android application and WiFi, and data is stored in cloud networks. In this active system, CO2 sensor, noise sensor, dust sensor, Microcontroller and an exhaust fan are used. This ESP-32 based system is developed in Arduino Integrated Development Environment (Aurdino IDE) to monitor air, dust and noise pollution in an indoor auditorium to prevent unwanted health problems related to noise and dust. More importantly, using IoT Android Application is developed in Embedded C, which continuously records the variation in levels of 3 parameters mentioned above in cloud and display in Android screen. Also, it sends an alert message to the users if the level of parameters exceeds the minimum and maximum threshold values with more accuracy and sensitivity. Accuracy and sensitivity of this products are noted which is very high for various input values.",

C-DASH generates HW (Hardware) and SWDE (Software Development Environment) from a processor definition file. To use C-DASH, each user must install C-DASH into local PC. When developing a processor as a team there is often a problem of file consistency, such as when another developer changes the same files you have. To solve this problem a collaborative development environment is required. This paper describes the implementation of a server side ubiquitous codesign environment for an ISA simulator. A server side codesign environment makes it unnecessary to install C-DASH onto local hosts, and makes codesign environment into device independent, and collaborative development becomes easier. A developer can upload a processor definition file via a web browser and develop an ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) simulator.",

        "Abstract": "The semantic Web refers to a range of standards, modeling languages and tool development initiatives aimed at annotating Web pages with well-defined metadata, so that the semantics associated with Web contexts can be effectively interpreted. The applications that deliver these new online solutions are all based on ontologies. An ontology can be described as a consensual, shared and formal description of key concepts in a given domain (D. Fensel et al., 2000). The ultimate aim is to be able to handle user requests at semantic levels. We propose a new approach to support concept based online search applications. An easy to use Web page development tool is deployed, providing a convenient mechanism to create semantically marked up Web pages. Search and coordination activities are carried out by intelligent agents designed for such environments. An application example using accommodation services in the Australian tourism industry has been provided to give our research an applied and pragmatic perspective.",

        "Abstract": "Since Arduino is the main entry-level platform to the world of electronic circuits and systems, there are many programming environments that try to ease the burden of Arduino textual programming on young primary students. Although block-based, most of these environments retain the imperative structures of textual programming languages, which are not easily comprehensible by such students. The proposed, in this paper, Learning-Arduino-With-Rules Introductory System (LAWRIS) tries to tackle this problem by adopting a rule-based approach: an Arduino-based pre-specified system can be programmed by constructing rules with very simple and intuitive jigsaw pieces, in a visual, web-based environment. Contrary to other programming environments for Arduino, the main logic of LAWRIS is implemented on the board side and only a configuration string is downloaded to it. Thus, LAWRIS features fast responses to both circuit input changes and program modifications, a very important characteristic for young students. It also imposes minimal overhead on the host system, allows web access of the programming environment, and has very low hardware cost.",

        "Abstract": "The advent of native mobile technologies particularly advances in the Mobile Operating Systems (OS), popularly among Android, Windows Mobile OS, iOS and their acceptance as an alternative to existing browser based access; has enabled the remote access of equipment and instruments over the World Wide Web (WWW). While more and more remote control solutions have been implemented in the industry via Local Area Networks (LANs), Wide Area Networks (WANs), and the Web, Online Remote Accessible Laboratory (ORAL) has surpassed the simulation as a tool for learning scientific methods with the results and observations being real time rather than ideal and facilitate the conduct of experiments on specific instrumentation from any location. The aim of this paper is to introduce an easy accessible Remote Laboratory Measuring System (RLMS) to provide the students to perform laboratory experiments on actual measurement instrumentation over any smart mobile device, tablets or desktops and PCs. The proposed architecture on real laboratory setup provides solutions for remote access and opens ways for future developments. The system is realized using LabVIEW graphical programming environment which confers its advantages.",

        "Abstract": "Java Digital Signal Processing (J-DSP) is a Java-based object-oriented programming environment that was developed at Arizona State University (ASU) for use in undergraduate- and graduate-level engineering classes. J-DSP is written as a platform-independent Java applet that resides on the Web and is thereby accessible by all students using a Web browser. We describe an innovative software extension to J-DSP, called 2D J-DSP, to accommodate on-line laboratories for two-dimensional digital signal processing. Two-dimensional DSP capabilities in J-DSP include: 2D signal generation; 2D FIR filter design and implementation; 2D transforms. Image processing capabilities include image restoration and enhancement. In order to illustrate 2D concepts graphically, contour (2D) and perspective (3D) plots have been incorporated in 2D J-DSP. Online laboratory exercises have been developed in the aforementioned areas for use in the graduate-level multidimensional signal processing and image processing courses at ASU, and are posted on the Website (http://jdsp.asu.edu). Statistical and qualitative evaluations that assess the learning experiences of the students that use 2D J-DSP are also presented.",

Recently, the prevalence of asynchronous feedback in programming languages such as Javascript and advances in visualizations and user interfaces have lead to a resurgence of live programming in online education communities (such as Khan Academy) and in experimental IDEs (such as LightTable). The LIVE 2013 workshop includes 11 papers describing visions, implementations, mashups, and new directions of live programming environments. The participants include both practitioners of live coding and researchers in programming languages and software engineering. Finally, several demos curated on the live workshop page are presented.",

Better and simpler software development tools along with cheaper electronics make it possible to embed web interfaces into small and inexpensive microprocessor based field devices. Embedding a web server in a field instrument or sensor, allows users to access these devices from anywhere in the world utilizing a standard Internet Browser. This eliminates the need for proprietary or dedicated control software. In addition, such interfaces allow manufacturers access to their products after they are shipped; simplifying maintenance, diagnostics, and in-place firmware upgrades. This paper describes some of the issues related to web embedded field devices and the development of such devices.",

This tool aims to support learners through the entire process of coding and using Arduinos in group projects at scale in formal classrooms. The novelty of this tool and its discussion for the VL/HCC community lies in the design and customization of this tool to meet real world constraints of formal classrooms. In addition, it encourages expansion of who we consider users and requires inclusion of where and how learning takes place to truly support human-centered development of programming tools. In this paper, we shift the focus from individual users to multiple groups of student users and 1–3 teachers/mentors in a classroom environment. In particular, this paper aims to make explicit the unique needs of teachers and students who may have limited technology expertise both in coding and using Arduinos in formal classroom environments, the human and technological constraints of a formal classroom and features we've designed into CASMM to address these needs. Through this paper, we aim to spark discussion about the human-centered requirements of these users and how tools that support learners end-to-end in the development process may be necessary to truly provide accessible programming languages and environments for a wide range of novices (i.e., students, classroom teachers, and college mentors/volunteers).",

Here we present an ML development environment for single-cell sequencing data analyses, together with a diverse set of realistic and accessible ML-Ready benchmark datasets. A cloud-based platform is built to dynamically scale workflows for collecting, processing, and managing various single-cell sequencing data to make them ML-ready. In addition, benchmarks for each problem formulation and a code-level and web-interface IDE for single-cell analysis method development are provided. These efforts provide an automated end-to-end single-cell analysis ML pipeline that simplifies and standardizes the process of single-cell data formatting, loading, model development, and model evaluation.",

        "Abstract": "Modern financial programming and modelling is highly information rich, but our programming tools are often information sparse, especially our strongly typed ones. This leads to an impasse where improvements in programming to aid accuracy and clarity of financial software implementation such as units-of-measure analysis or typed functional programming can't be rolled out to industry. The F# programming language is increasingly used in implementing financial software and models [1]. It includes a feature called “Type Providers” to support the integration of large-scale information sources into a strongly typed functional-first programming environment. In this tutorial, we show that through the use of this simple, intuitive, scalable and on-demand mechanism called \"type providers\", we can bridge modern strongly-typed languages to the myriad of heterogeneous data services found in the modern financial programming context — for example entity graphs, databases, web services, spreadsheets and even other programming languages. We demonstrate applications using the F# language and the Xenomorph TimeScape time-series database system. • The specific F# 3.0 implementation of the type provider design has the following characteristics: • The mechanism scales to information sources containing extremely large quantities of metadata. • The mechanism can be applied to a myriad of heterogeneous data sources, including databases (SQL, vectored, time-series), web data protocols (WSDL, OData), entity graphs (Freebase), networked data markets and networked information services (World Bank). • The mechanism enables the use of code completion and interactive type checking to increase analyst efficiency when working with rich information sources. • The mechanism interacts with strongly typed tooling such as documentation assistance and completion lists and uses these as the primary way of exploring and understanding the information sources being used. • The programming experience is code focused and integrates well with strongly typed data scripting REPL environments (e.g. F# Interactive). • The programming infrastructure is neutral with regard to the protocol and data formats used. F# itself, as a language, has no specific dependency on external data sources or formats. • The mechanism uses an open architecture, so one can easily add new type providers that consume a different kind of schematized data. • The mechanism integrates technically with advanced features of type systems such as units of measure. Further, it multiplies the value of these features because of the quantity and importance of unitized data available in external in-formation sources. The tutorial will give demonstrations using the F# language. F# is a highly-productive functional-first language for correct, succcinct, robust analytical code in production environments. F# is open source and cross-platform, available under the Apache 2.0 license at http://fsharp.org. The Visual F# Tools are a supported product from Microsoft.",

        "Abstract": "Within a short period, the Internet and World Wide Web have become ubiquitous, surpassing all other technological developments in our history. They've also grown rapidly in their scope and extent of use, significantly affecting all aspects of our lives. Industries such as manufacturing, travel and hospitality, banking, education, and government are Web-enabled to improve and enhance their operations. E-commerce has expanded quickly, cutting across national boundaries. Even traditional legacy information and database systems have migrated to the Web. Advances in wireless technologies and Web-enabled appliances are triggering a new wave of mobile Web applications. As a result, we increasingly depend on a range of Web applications. Now that many of us rely on Web based systems and applications, they need to be reliable and perform well. To build these systems and applications, Web developers need a sound methodology, a disciplined and repeatable process, better development tools, and a set of good guidelines. The emerging field of Web engineering fulfils these needs. It uses scientific, engineering, and management principles and systematic approaches to successfully develop, deploy, and maintain high-quality Web systems and applications. It aims to bring the current chaos in Web based system development under control, minimize risks, and enhance Web site maintainability and quality.",

        "Abstract": "Web application vulnerability scanners (WAVS) include crawler components to extract all accessible links of tested web pages in order to identify attack entry points and parameters. After extracting links, they perform different types of attacks over each extracted link and try to find out existing vulnerabilities in the tested web application for reporting. A WAVS tool that has a low-quality crawler component would generate false-negative results, since failing to discover existing links would inhibit detection of possible vulnerabilities exposed through these links. Therefore, the coverage quality of its crawler plays a very important role in the success of a WAVS tool. In this paper, we propose a novel method for analyzing and comparing coverage qualities of WAVS crawlers. We developed WIVET (Web Input Vector Extractor Teaser) as a benchmarking tool for analyzing crawler components of WAVS. WIVET evaluates WAVS crawlers based on their extraction capability of 56 target links that are generated statically or dynamically by WIVET's 21 test cases. We explain WIVET's architecture, all WIVET test cases and target links with code examples, integration of WIVET into WAVS development environments and WAVS benchmarking results in detail.",

        "Abstract": "In the realm of remote control, my preference is computer manipulation through hand gestures. Recent strides in technology showcase the feasibility of using manual gestures on Arduino platforms, facilitated by cloud computing. A Wi-Fi-based hand gesture computer control system was developed using an ESP-01 Wi-Fi module and an Arduino microcontroller, enabling remote control and monitoring without geographical constraints or time limitations. The ESP8266 Wi-Fi module played a crucial role in establishing wireless communication with an Android application (S Remote) for transmitting commands to regulate domestic appliances. The AT mega 328 AVR series Microcontroller R3, lacking built-in Wi-Fi, required the ESP-01 Wi-Fi module for wireless communication and programming. The Arduino IDE facilitated programming, incorporating ESP-01 and LCD components. Hand gesture-controlled robots and PC/laptop hand gesture control systems, both utilizing Arduino technology, exemplify similar applications. The Human Machine Interface (HMI) concept involves physical components and software enabling communication between users and machines. HMI devices, including LED indicators and touch screens, traditionally use keyboards and mice. This research implemented a hand gesture controller using Arduino technology, specifically for web browser features, video playback, and VLC media player audio adjustments. The ESP-01 Wi-Fi module, configured via AT instructions through a UART serial connection, played a key role in integrating a hand gesture system for effective computer control. Users can perform actions like playing or pausing videos and adjusting audio amplitude within the VLC media player solely through manual gestures.",

To that end, Milo uses graphical blocks as abstractions of language specific implementations of Data Science and Machine Learning(ML) concepts along with creation of interactive visualizations. Using block definitions created by a user, Milo generates equivalent source code in JavaScript to run entirely in the browser.

        "Abstract": "Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems employ a wide range of computer and communication technologies. Advances in these technologies have helped in improving the effectiveness of SCADA. One such development is the Internet and the World Wide Web. True to its name, it has been successful in casting a web over the wide variety of platforms and applications used in the entire information technology industry. The network thus achieved, paved a way for the common interfaces to access the data available on the net. The Internet has a strong influence on the applications and the application development environment. So, how exactly can SCADA and EMS benefit from this technological revolution ? To start with, it gives global access to the SCADA data. Today, the Internet is accessible from most corners of the world. Any off-the-shelf web browser could provide the connectivity and access to the data. This means freedom from vendor dependent hardware and software. Apart from this, it also means that different departments of a utility can also access the data without having to put in place a dedicated Intranet and other such infrastructure which calls for investments. Data security will be a matter of concern and has to be addressed. This paper talks about such issues as well as a pilot implementation.",

        "Abstract": "SSC-DASH (Server Side C-like Design Automation Shell) has been developed as a Web-based HW/SW codesign tool for designing processors. SSC-DASH obtains a processor definition file via Web browser and generates a HW (synthesizable Verilog-HDL description) and SWDE (Software Development Environment) for the generated processor. The SWDE includes ISS (Instruction Set Simulator), assembler, disassembler and compiler. For the verification of the defined processor, processor developers have to download the generated SWDE, every time, even where changes are small. To improve the usability of this system a Web-based interface for the generated SWDE is implemented using Ajax. Using Ajax, download of the SWDE becomes unnecessary and makes it possible to verify the processor on the server quickly and easily. This greatly improves the usability of the SWDE. In this paper, we describe implementation of Web-based ISS using Ajax.",

        "Abstract": "Nowadays, invoking third party code increasingly involves calling web services via their web APIs, as opposed to the more traditional scenario of downloading a library and invoking the library's API. However, there are also new challenges for developers calling these web APIs. In this paper, we highlight abroad set of these challenges and argue for resulting opportunities for software engineering research to support developers in consuming web APIs. We outline two specific research threads in this context: (1) web API specification curation, which enables us to know the signatures of web APIs, and (2) static analysis that is capable of extracting URLs, HTTP methods etc. of web API calls. Furthermore, we present new work on how we combine (1) and (2) to provide IDE support for application developers consuming web APIs. As web APIs are used broadly, research in supporting the consumption of web APIs offers exciting opportunities.",

        "Abstract": "Digital technologies empower the transformation into data-driven, intelligent, agile, and autonomous farm operations and are typically considered a key to addressing the grand challenges in agriculture. To avoid unscientific water supply for plantation as well as to save the water and also yield the better crop, therefore, to increase production efficiency out of smart irrigation and to send the status of irrigation at standard environmental conditions, The Internet of Things (IoT) based prototype is designed and implemented. The prototype automatically turns ON /OFF the motor pump based on the moisture level of the soil by taking the temperature and humidity of the environment near the plantation into consideration (In India, the standard parameters for watering the vegetable plantation are Humidity>60%, Temperature < 25°C and Humidity<40% ). The prototype is designed with an ESP32S microcontroller with DHT 11 and a moisture sensor. Arduino IDE development tool is used for programming ESP32S using embedded C programming language. The prototype is configured, programmed, and connected to the Arduino IoT cloud. The data of temperature, humidity, and moisture are received via message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol on IoT cloud through public IP therefore the data can be accessed worldwide. The authorized person can access the data and control the motor pump from anywhere across the world. The test data obtained out of the prototype over the cloud and at the system are presented in the result section.",

        "Abstract": "Programming education has become an essential part of the primary and secondary school curriculum. Two main programming environment modalities, web-based visual programming applications and electronic cards, have become popular in curricular activities. Limiting the programming activities around these programming environments restricts education accessibility in socio-economically disadvantaged regions due to the need for an individual computer per student, lack of decent infrastructure, and high electronics prices. Effective, shared use of smartphones and tablets in programming education can provide equal opportunities. In this scenario, students can code simple drawings and animations using their own materials as tangible programming blocks by employing a single shared phone in the classroom as an interpreter. This article explains our development process of a new tangible programming environment which increases the accessibility of education. We discuss effective inclassroom use of image/text processing practices and transfer learning methods on smartphones.",

        "Abstract": "This process of creating an IDE core for the event-driven temporal requirements specification language called EDTL is outlined in the paper. Developed at the Institute of Automation and Electrometry SB RAS, EDTL is used for specifying requirements for reactive software. Such programs control cyber-physical systems, embedded systems, and PLC systems built using IEC 61131-3 or poST languages. Most of these safety critical systems are subject to mandatory verification. At the same time, as practice shows, failures in the operation of such systems in most cases are caused by errors in the specification of requirements. Therefore, the issue of requirements specification and the issue of requirements specification language are extremely important for the safety of the reactive system being developed. The advantages of EDTL include the relative simplicity of the language, the ability to specify requirements in terms of events and time intervals, independence from verification systems, and the presence of strict formal semantics that can be expressed using linear temporal logic. These advantages make EDTL a very promising requirements specification tool. The EDTL IDE comprises a language-oriented editor equipped with syntax and semantic analysis capabilities, an abstract syntax tree generator, and a library facilitating interaction with the generated abstract syntax tree. The research, the results of which are presented in the paper, is aimed at creating and EDTL IDE. The paper provides the motivation for the research, development requirements, IDE architecture, and the process of creating an IDE using the Eclipse toolchain. Finally, the article discusses the possibility of creating a web version of the EDTL IDE based on the results obtained and using Theia IDE.",

        "Abstract": "It is a key issue to handle many tasks efficiently in cloud computing at low cost. For the cloud computing scheduling problem, in order to efficiently and reasonably assign a large number of tasks submitted by users to cloud computing resources, a task scheduling algorithm (IDE) based on improved differential evolution is proposed to consider both task completion time and cost dual objectives. The algorithm introduces an immune operator into the traditional differential evolution algorithm. According to the vaccination probability, the population is vaccinated during the iterative process to speed up the convergence of the algorithm. Introducing the judgment mechanism on the selection strategy can shorten the running time of the algorithm and effectively improve the shortcomings of the standard differential evolution algorithm with slow convergence speed. The original fixed scaling factor F becomes adaptive, which helps to increase the diversity of the population. The simulation experiment of the proposed algorithm is performed on the cloud computing platform CloudSim. Comparing the IDE algorithm with the traditional differential evolution algorithm, genetic algorithm and Min-Min algorithm, the results show that IDE algorithm task completion time is short, which improves the utilization of cloud computing resource pools, and the cost of computing resources in a similar period of time is low.",

        "Abstract": "Optional type annotations allow for enriching dynamic programming languages with static typing features like better Integrated Development Environment (IDE) support, more precise program analysis, and early detection and prevention of type-related runtime errors. Machine learning-based type inference promises interesting results for automating this task. However, the practical usage of such systems depends on their ability to generalize across different domains, as they are often applied outside their training domain.In this work, we investigate Type4Py as a representative of state-of-the-art deep learning-based type inference systems, by conducting extensive cross-domain experiments. Thereby, we address the following problems: class imbalances, out-of-vocabulary words, dataset shifts, and unknown classes.To perform such experiments, we use the datasets Many-Types4Py and CrossDomainTypes4Py. The latter we introduce in this paper. Our dataset enables the evaluation of type inference systems in different domains of software projects and has over 1,000,000 type annotations mined on the platforms GitHub and Libraries. It consists of data from the two domains web development and scientific calculation.Through our experiments, we detect that the shifts in the dataset and the long-tailed distribution with many rare and unknown data types decrease the performance of the deep learning-based type inference system drastically. In this context, we test unsupervised domain adaptation methods and fine-tuning to overcome these issues. Moreover, we investigate the impact of out-of-vocabulary words.",

        "Abstract": "Everyone is talking about Java. The driving force for this chatter is Java's simplicity and potential power. Java is programming language, and a language for the intranet and the World Wide Web (WWW). Java is a Write On one platform and Run on Many platforms (WORM) language. For network-friendly, platform-independent applications, Java (originally Oak) is an object oriented programming language. Java source code is compiled into a virtual machine code or bytecode. This makes the Java platform independent. It can be placed on a Web site, and executed on the client side on a PC-Intel, Mac, Motorola or UNIX-Solaris machine without recompiling. Sun Microsystems formally announced Java in May 1995. Java is the first language that has built-in capabilities for networking applications, in particular, creating dynamic Web pages. Java programs that run on the Internet Web pages are called applets. These applets are easily incorporated into Web pages. These applets are executed from homepages on remote Web sites. Java programs run interpretively on the client side. Java reduces development costs and speeds up the learning curve. Traditional client server development tools-such as Delphi, Power-Builder and Visual Basic-are losing ground to Java as a result. By the year-end of 1996, Java had moved ahead in use of both C and C++ and these application development tools.",

        "Abstract": "The need for powerful and flexible platforms for teaching and learning computer programming concepts is increasing due to the growing number of interested attendees. Although implementing a complete platform from scratch would achieve the best flexibility in terms of possible features, it also requires a huge time-consuming effort. This paper proposes Coderiu, a platform built on top of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) packages suitably integrated to implement the desired learning platform. Such features include platform independence of code editing, which is achieved by leveraging a web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The environment is extended with custom features to enable the automated testing of the solutions and the automatic remote backup of the working directories. Moreover, the architecture was made suitable to be used in classroom exams, which require a controlled environment. A critical aspect of the Coderiu platform, beside the integration of its components and modules, is represented by the scalability. The Coderiu platform is used by hundreds of students in case of courses in relatively small classes, while it is ready to serve a larger user base in the future. For this reason, requirements and performance are studied on a pilot installation to derive insights regarding the resources required for larger deployments.",

        "Abstract": "Detecting instances of plagiarism in student homework, especially programming homework, is an important issue for practitioners. In the past decades, several tools have emerged that are able to effectively compare large corpora of homeworks and sort pairs by degree of similarity. However, those tools are available to students as well, allowing them to experiment and develop elaborate methods for evading detection. Also, such tools are unable to detect instances of “external plagiarism” where students obtained unethical help from sources not among other students of the same course. One way to battle this problem is to monitor student activity while solving their homeworks using a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) and detect suspicious behaviours. Each editing event in program source can be stored as a new commit to create a form of ultra-fine-grained source code repository. In this paper, the authors propose several new features that can be extracted from such repositories with the purpose of building a comprehensive profile of each individual developer. Machine learning techniques were used to detect suspicious behaviours, which allowed the authors to significantly improve upon the performance of more traditional plagiarism detection tools.",

        "Abstract": "This research developed a low cost smart control system that enables virtual monitoring and control of a closed-loop system using a NodeMCU microcontroller linked to the cloud or internet network. The designed system allows adjustments for Proportional-Integral (PI) controller and setpoint settings of the real-time operating system to be performed anywhere and anytime via Blynk IoT platform. The analysis is demonstrated using experimental test to a light control system, where the PI controller controls light luminosity emitted by Light Emitting Diode (LED). The designed Graphical User Interface (GUI) is capable of notifying system failure by sending an alarm notification message to the electronic device connected to the physical system virtually, so the biased or unstable process parameters could be immediately mitigated when it occurs. Empirical model identification is conducted via MATLAB simulation, followed by the calculation of controller tunings. MATLAB analysis further analyses gain values, that can affect the adjustment of proportional and integral gains for the stability and good control. Data downloading can be performed either via the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) software or the Superchart in the Blynk. The experimental analysis showed that the light control system has perform well while the Blynk is connected virtually to the light control system.",

        "Abstract": "The undergoing fourth industrial revolution is constantly putting an accent on the integration of all entities within a single computational system, by moving from a centralized cloud architecture to edge computation. The decentralization of computational power needs a fog architecture, since it's becoming essential to reduce the latency required to take decisions in the industrial environment, in a way that does not violate timing constraints. This work describes the development and the deployment of an industrial fog architecture based on open source tools for Industry 4.0, called IFog4.0. The proposed architecture is able to exchange data using industrial networks and communication protocols, such as Profinet and Modbus TCP, and it is mainly intended to be deployed to Small and Medium Enterprise (SME). Automation is provided by the proposed programming Integrated Development Environment (IDE), while platform management is implemented by the Fog-Management tool. Furthermore, IFog4.0 embeds other open source tools such as Docker and Grafana, to perform data visualization and transmission. Verification is carried out by deploying the platform to an emulated industrial environment. A gas regulation station has been selected as the main usecase.",

But to truly implement cloud computing, we need to gradually improve it in academic, legal and institutional. Especially, the issue of trust is one of the biggest obstacles for the development of cloud computing. In the cloud computing, due to users directly use and operate the software and OS, and even basic programming environment and network infrastructure which provided by the cloud services providers, so the impact and destruction for the software and hardware cloud resources in cloud computing are worse than the current Internet users who use it to share resources. Therefore, that whether user behavior is trusted, how to evaluate user behavior trust is an important research content in cloud computing. mainly discusses evaluation importance of user behavior trust and evaluation strategy, in the cloud computing, including trust object analysis, principle on evaluating user behavior trust, basic idea of evaluating user behavior trust, evaluation strategy of behavior trust for each access, and long access, which laid the theoretical foundation about trust for the practical cloud computing application.",

        "Abstract": "Code comprehension is a mental process in any maintenance activity. It becomes decisive in large methods. Such methods are burdened with programming constructs as lines of code (LOC) correlate with McCabe's cyclomatic complexity (MCC). This makes it hard to capture their code, as they span many pages even in large screens, and as a result hinders grasping their structural properties that might be key for maintenance. Visualization can assist in comprehending complex systems. It has been shown that control structure diagrams (CSDs) could be useful to better understand and discover structural properties, such as code regularity, of such large methods. IDEs and development tools have been moving from desktops to the Web so as to benefit from this ubiquitous environment that provides instant collaboration and easier integration.This paper presents ICSD, an interactive Web-based tool that implements CSD for Java methods. In particular it visualizes their control structure and nesting. The interactivity of the tool enables the developer to examine the underlying code of specific parts in the diagram. Using ICSD the developer can compare between different regions in the diagram that seem to have any kind of commonality or other interesting relation. ICSD easily conveys structural characteristics of the code, especially very large code, to the programmer and helps him to better understand and refactor.To demonstrate the usage and usefulness of ICSD, very large functions from real softwares are presented and the different features of ICSD are shown.",

The solution to the problem is formulated as a combination of the opinions of different experts. The experts in this work are two existing techniques for feature location: a scenario-based probabilistic ranking of events and an information-retrieval-based technique that uses latent semantic indexing. The combination of these two experts is empirically evaluated through several case studies, which use the source code of the Mozilla Web browser and the Eclipse integrated development environment. The results show that the combination of experts significantly improves the effectiveness of feature location as compared to each of the experts used independently",

        "Abstract": "Over the last years, electronic exams have received increasing attention, as they offer far more potential than simply replacing paper-based questions by electronically supported multiple choice questions, or replacing blank paper by text fields in a web-browser or PDF form. Especially in the area of software development and software engineering, both students and teachers expect to benefit from an exam environment where students can utilize the same set of tools that they are used to from working on their homework exercises. Furthermore, teachers expect that electronic exams provide support with respect to automatic assessment. In this paper, we investigate applying electronic exams to introductory programming courses. In these exams, students have to solve programming problems using an integrated development environment, and hand in source code as their solution. This, however, requires a shift in formulating exam tasks, in order to align these tasks with learning objectives. It also requires careful investigation into the students' ability to cope with the environment and the rigorous supervision by a compiler and other checkers under time restrictions and, possibly, the nerves of an exam situation. To achieve this, we discuss how programming tasks can be designed in a manner that allows addressing all levels of Bloom's taxonomy of learning objectives, in order to implement constructive alignment. Furthermore we analyze our students' behavior during exams and their perception of this kind of exam. As well, we analyze the resulting solutions and identify typical error patterns that occur.",

        "Abstract": "An analytical review of the history of the leading vendors' providers in the field of programmable logic device manufacturing is presented. The analysis of development environment changes for FPGA-based projects, and a comparative analysis of FPGA chips and development kit boards for testing are performed. The practical experience of the transition process to new development environments for FPGA-based projects is considered. It is established that the dynamics of changes in development environments must be addressed at an early stage to reduce risks. It is shown that in-system programming significantly simplifies the development of FPGA-based projects. It is shown that scaling and parallelization at the top level of project hierarchy and pipelining and parameterization at the RTL level effectively allow such systems to be deployed in commercial cloud infrastructures and data centers.",

It is important to monitor the lightning detection in real-time to avoid the deaths caused by lightning. In this paper we present the design and development of an IoT based Storm (Lightning) detection system with a provision to display message on an Android mobile using Cloud computing technology. The entire system is built around Franklin lightning detector chip AS3935 on a thunder click board with an on-board integrated coil antenna MA5532. This board is connectedto the Texas Instruents' CC3200 LaunchPad and SIM900A GSM module to complete the design. The communication interface established between sensor and ThingSpeak cloud via CC3200 will help online data monitoring anywhere in the globe. Provision is made to store the history of lightning on a SIM card for further analysis such as estimation of rainfall. The experiment is performed at Sri Krishnadevaraya University, Anantapuramu. The identified location and the lightning values are displayed on Cloud (IoT-Cloud). The software is developed using Energia IDE.",

This paper describes the motivation for creating a new Web application test framework, and briefly describes the architecture and design of the framework. The framework is browser agnostic, easy to use, employs a high level programming language and development environment allowing integrated debugging and object oriented design, permits low level access to UI controls, and is resilient to UI changes in the application under test. The architecture of the framework features a two-layer design which isolates all browser specific functionality, allowing test scenario developers to focus on testing related issues rather than on implementation details. The architecture of the framework can be used with most modern operating system platforms. Early experience with the framework has been promising.",

        "Abstract": "Cloud platforms are increasingly being used for hosting a broad diversity of services from traditional e-commerce applications to interactive web-based Ides. How-ever, we observe that the proliferation of offers by cloud providers raises several challenges. Developers will not only have to deploy applications for a specific cloud, but will also have to consider migrating services from one cloud to another, and to manage distributed applications spanning multiple clouds. In this paper, we present our federated multi-cloud PaaS infrastructure for addressing these challenges. This infrastructure is based on three foundations: i) an open service model used to design and implement both our multi-cloud PaaSand the SaaS applications running on top of it, ii) a configurable architecture of the federated PaaS, and iii) some infrastructure services for managing both our multi-cloud PaaS and the SaaS applications. We then show how this multi-cloud PaaS can be deployed on top of thirteen existing IaaS/PaaS. We finally report on three distributed SaaS applications developed with and deployed on our federated multi-cloud PaaS infrastructure.",

The high-level functional Web components sum up various kinds of data in two dimensions as in Microsoft Excel. These components reduce the amount of code to be written by developers greatly. The paper also describes the system that implements these high-level functional components as visual Web components. This system assists in the development of Web applications based on a page-transition framework that regards a Web application as a sequence of Web page transitions.By using visual Web components, the system makes it easier to write actions executed when a Web page transfers to another.",

        "Abstract": "Web active end users often coalesce web information using web mashups. Web contents, however, tend to evolve frequently, and along with the black box nature of visual languages this complicates the process of debugging mashups. While debugging, end users need to locate faults within the code and then find a way to correct them; this process requires them to seek information related to web page content and behavior. In this paper, using an information foraging theory lens, we qualitatively study the debugging behaviors of 16 web-active end users. Our results show that the stronger scents available within mashup programming environments can improve users' foraging success. Our results lead to a new model for debugging activities framed in terms of information foraging theory, and to a better understanding of ways in which end-user programming environments can be enhanced to better support debugging.",

        "Abstract": "Augmented reality (AR) systems support complex tasks like assembly by overlaying task-related content onto the real world. In recent years, the effort of designing and developing assembly task support systems in AR decreased with the availability of high potential head-mounted displays and provision of integrated development environments. Nevertheless, problems still arise when companies craft an effective AR task support system, particularly in the difficulty of selecting appropriate techniques and information-presentation methods, and the requirements that vary with each use case. In this study, we formulated a corresponding guideline, developed a selection aid tool that incorporates filtering based on the categorization of subtasks and the degree of freedom of available tracking, and evaluated their effectiveness in two experiments. First, to confirm effects on system design, we asked 18 participants to perform the design action of the AR system with the guideline for two tasks (PC assembly and rope work). Consequently, to verify the quality of the designed AR systems from Experiment 1, we asked another set of 20 participants to perform the same tasks with those systems. The results confirm that using the guideline can considerably lower efforts creating media and alleviate the error for a specific process. We envision our guideline and tool to be accessible as an online web page, assisting AR assembly task support system designer/developers worldwide.",

We surveyed nonprogrammers' needs for web applications and studied how nonprogrammers would naturally approach web development. To express what a tool should provide we summarize high-level components and concepts employed by web applications. To express how a tool may provide its functionality, we propose \"Programming-at-Runtime\" - a programming paradigm that is in its core similar to the automatic recalculation in spreadsheets.

        "Abstract": "The widespread application of specialized embedded devices and their ever-growing sensing capabilities lead to an overload of raw data reaching the Cloud via the Internet of Things. Despite this massive amount of available data, data-driven applications still produce a limited impact on the real world. We argue that this limitation arises from the complexity the developers still face when engineering and deploying solutions on a plurality of embedded devices. Instead of focusing on constructing valuable information from raw data and designing algorithms to exploit it, the developers still have to figure out on their own: how to partition the computation between Edge, Fog, and Cloud; how to move partial results around in highly distributed solutions; how to create abstract interfaces to expose information-rich endpoints. This paper introduces the Virtual Sensor Domain-Specific Language (DSL), which builds the keystone for designing and developing powerful Computer-Aided Design tools and Integrated Development Environments to support the developers in focusing on information manipulation. The Virtual Sensor DSL is built on top of C++ to ease its adoption by the embedded development community. It introduces a reactive approach to data collection, technology mapping, and workload distribution. It allows the creation of adaptable Virtual Sensors, streaming processed information coming from the integration of multiple raw data streams, and it comes with integrated simulation capabilities, supporting prototyping. In this paper, we describe the entities the language offers, how the developers can exploit them, and analyze a real-world use case that benefitted from the Virtual Sensor DSL.",

Computer systems have also been designed to make verification and validation easier such as the work on Design for Verification. The concepts of separation of concerns and modular design are two examples of how design decisions can make verification and validation easier. The objective of this research is to verify cloud-based systems and use its design to make the verification easier. Since a cloud-based system consists of many interacting software and hardware components, we start with verifying OpenNebula, a cloud-based system middleware. The methodology is to analyze OpenNebula's code and identify the design patterns that will later be used in simplifying the verification. The analysis is performed by reverse engineering the code using class diagram generation tools and code analysis functions in an Intergrated Development Environment (IDE). This paper will present the design patterns in OpenNebula and how it can influence the verification.",

The ontology is the recommended mechanism by W3C for these formal semantics and it is considered as a backbone of every SW application. Its design is remained lack of attention during engineering process of SW applications. In this paper we propose a technique for ontology design during SW application engineering process. By incorporating this technique, existing web applications design methods may easily be upgraded for SW applications. We illustrate proposed technique using a case study, formalize resultant specification it in OWL standards through ontology development tool Protege, and then validate it using W3C online ontology validation service.",

Digital libraries of computer science research and education conference and journal articles can be a rich source for code examples that are used to motivate or explain particular concepts or issues. Because they are used as examples in an article, these code examples are accompanied by descriptions of their functionality, properties, or other associated information expressed in natural language text. Identifying code segments in these documents is relatively straightforward, thus this paper tackles the problem of extracting the natural language text that is associated with each code segment in an article. We present and evaluate a set of heuristics that address the challenges of the text often not being colocated with the code segment as in developer communications such as online forums.",

However, the state of the art development environments has a high learning barrier for users' lack of programming experience. In this paper, instead of traditional programming environments, we take consideration of ordinary users' requirements and propose a WYSIWYG cross-platform web-component-based mobile application creation environment for ordinary users. This environment has a visual editor with a drag-and-drop web component. A web component library model is proposed to standardize customized libraries. A cross-platform application model based on web components is implemented to build applications rapidly. It helps ordinary users generate installing packages within simple operations for multiple platforms. A native plugin model is proposed to assist web components to invoke native functionalities. The experiment result shows that ordinary users could quickly start to create mobile applications in our environment.",

Search based on keyword matching and content classified are two methods of the traditional search, however, their performance of processing exponential growth data is unsatisfactory. The concept of the Semantic Web, which was proposed to solve the shortage of network intelligence in 2001, provided the feasibility solutions of retrieving. The Semantic Web application could become a reality since XML (Extensible Markup Language), RDF (Resource Description Framework) and OWL (Web Ontology Language) are improved and the emergence of Jena which is the Semantic Web [1] development tools. So the concept of semantic retrieval with Semantic Web technology and search engine technology comes up, we aim to propose a system Architecture based on Semantic Web.",

        "Abstract": "Hybrid cloud is defined as a cloud infrastructure composed of two or more cloud infrastructures (private, public, and community clouds) that remain unique entities, but are bound together via technologies and approaches for the purposes of application and data portability. This paper will review a novel approach for implementing a secure hybrid cloud. Specifically, public and private cloud entities will be discussed for a hybrid cloud approach. The approach is based on extension of virtual Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Layer 2 switching functions from a private cloud and to public clouds, tunneled on an OSI Layer 3 connection. As a result of this hybrid cloud approach, virtual workloads can be migrated from the private cloud to the public cloud and continue to be part of the same Layer 2 domain as in the private cloud, thereby maintaining consistent operational paradigms in bot the public and private cloud. This paper will introduce and discuss the virtual switching technologies which are fundamental underpinnings of the secure hybrid approach. This paper will not only discuss the virtual Layer 2 technical architecture of this approach, but also related security components. Specifically, data in motion security between the public and private clouds and interworkload secure communication in the public cloud will be reviewed. As part of the hybrid cloud approach, security aspects like encrypted communication tunnels, key management, and security management will be discussed. Moreover, management consoles, control points, and integration with cloud orchestration systems will also be discussed. Additionally, hybrid cloud consideration for network services like network firewall, server load balancers, application accelerators, and network routing functions will be examined. Finally, several practical use cases which can be applicable in the aerospace industry, like workload bursting, application development environments, and Disaster Recovery as a Service will be explored.",

        "Abstract": "Services, such as Stack Overflow, offer a web platform to programmers for discussing technical issues, in form of Question and Answers (Q&A). Since Q&A services store the discussions, the generated “crowd knowledge” can be accessed and consumed by a large audience for a long time. Nevertheless, Q&A services are detached from the development environments used by programmers: Developers have to tap into this crowd knowledge through web browsers and cannot smoothly integrate it into their workflow. This situation hinders part of the benefits of Q&A services. To better leverage the crowd knowledge of Q&A services, we created Seahawk, an Eclipse plugin that supports an integrated and largely automated approach to assist programmers using Stack Overflow. Seahawk formulates queries automatically from the active context in the IDE, presents a ranked and interactive list of results, lets users import code samples in discussions through drag & drop and link Stack Overflow discussions and source code persistently as a support for team work.

        "Abstract": "This paper presents WappenLite, a Web-based application framework aimed primarily at lightweight educational programming environments, with a Flash-based editor component designed for novice learners. Most existing Web-based educational programming environments, often designed for a single programming language, offer little room for customization. Our research group has developed a Web-based application framework for educational programming environments called Wappen. Wappen-based applications can be adapted for a variety of programming languages and support extensive customization by teachers via the Eclipse RCP (Rich Client Platform). However, Wappen-based applications have some deficiencies. In particular, they can be slow to start up because of their large size, and it is difficult for teachers to tailor user interfaces written using the SWT (Standard Widget Toolkit). WappenLite is more lightweight and can offer a richer user interface because it allows teachers to use HTML and Flash as the platform for writing user interfaces. This paper describes a Flash-based user interface that is designed for novice learners and implemented as a WappenLite-based application.",

The purpose of the review is to provide a set of developments in the field of ML for students and developers of digital technologies in all fields of activities compactly. The ML Libraries (MLL) have been classifying by languages implementation and by basic methods specificity. The table “MLL-Features” has been compiling. The features characterize a set of methods, a technique and a task orientation of each library. In total, there are more than 40 such libraries for developing server-side and client-side of knowledge-based Information Systems (KBIS), deep Artificial Neuron Network (ANN), and Natural Language Processing. Most of them are new but are ready for use by developers. As the review one result, it became clear that ML libraries are quite accessible to students and even high school students. The advantage of Web languages is that they are useful both for understanding ready projects and for direct use: only a web browser and development environment are required to run an ML project in JavaScript. The review is useful for undergraduates, graduates, postgraduates and novice developers of artificial intelligence systems and KBIS.",

        "Abstract": "Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) advocates the use of models and their transformations, to better understand software systems and to increase the degree of automation across the software development process. However, with the increasing complexity of modern software systems, distributed development teams, and increasing time pressure for developing these systems, there is a need to collaborate more quickly when building and analyzing models. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced classroom-based software projects to organizational-level software systems to rely on virtual (web-based) collaborative development environments. Therefore, real-time collaborative modelling remains no longer an option but becomes a necessity for MDE too. In our previous work, we introduce a framework, tColab, which uses Eclipse Che workspaces to enable web-based collaborative modelling. However, with real-time collaboration, modelling conflicts can arise and their resolution goes beyond what is possible with the collaborative environment facilitated by an Eclipse Che workspace. In this paper, we extend our tColab framework for building modelling language editors as Visual Studio (VS) Code extensions. These VS Code extensions are well supported by widely used platforms such as VS Code IDE, Eclipse Theia IDE, and the Eclipse Che platform. Furthermore, to facilitate real-time collaboration using these VS Code extensions and to enable conflict-free modelling, we explore two possible solutions – the VS Code Live Share extension and the Teletype CRDTs (conflict-free replicated data types) library. Finally, we provide a prototypical VS Code extension for the TGRL (Textual Goal-oriented Requirement Language) as a proof-of-concept of our extended framework and demonstrate conflict-free collaborative modelling for TGRL using the Live Share extension.",

        "Abstract": "Cloud computing can be defined as the use of new or existing computing hardware and virtualization technologies to form a shared infrastructure that enables web-based value added services. The three predominant service models are infrastructure, platform, and software-asa-service. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) can be defined as the use of servers, storage, and virtualization to enable utility like services for users. Security is a big concern within IaaS, especially considering that the rest of the cloud service models run on top of the infrastructure and related layers. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) providers offer access to APIs, programming languages and development middleware which allows subscribers to develop custom applications without installing or configuring the development environment. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) gives subscribed or pay-peruse users access to software or services which reside in the cloud and not on the user's device. Understanding the cloud service models is critical in determining if cloud services or hosting are an appropriate business solution, and if so, which model best balances the level of control required versus reduced hardware, configuration, and maintenance costs. Cloud computing offers many benefits to organizations; it has enabled collaboration amongst disparate communities and workgroups, and has overcome challenges that have plagued existing business solutions. However, the security, privacy, and integrity of the cloud are of prime importance and there are many challenges that exist. At the present time there seems to be a lot of momentum behind the adoption of cloud computing despite these. This may simply be a trend, an indication that society truly wants their data to be available whenever from anywhere, or a sign that few understand the associated risks.",

        "Abstract": "Remote robotics laboratories have been successfully used for engineering education. However, few of them use mobile robots to to teach computer science. This article describes a mobile robot Control and Programming Environment (CPE) and its pedagogical applications. The system comprises a remote laboratory for robotics, an online programming tool, and a virtual learning environment. It allows experiments with a mobile robot to be carried out, tested and validated remotely, using a simple graphic interface via web browser, without additional software installation on the user's computer. Students can control and manipulate the robot with simple commands without worrying about hardware details or use C/C++ programming language to develop complex programs. The robot has been built with inexpensive components and has sensors that enable its use in several experiments. CPE can be used in contextualized teaching in various subjects of computer science, both in class and at distance. A practical application of the whole system using CPE, introducing programming concepts, is also described in this paper. The initial assessment of the environment as an educational tool shows high levels of interest among our students, an improvement in their academic scores, and potential for application in the context of computing education, when properly introduced as a learning tool.",

        "Abstract": "When a developer is writing code they are usually focused and in a state-of-mind which some refer to as flow. Breaking out of this flow can cause the developer to lose their train of thought and have to start their thought process from the beginning. This loss of thought can be caused by interruptions and sometimes slow IDE interactions. Predictive functionality has been harnessed in user applications to speed up load times, such as in Google Chrome's browser which has a feature called \"Predicting Network Actions\". This will pre-load web-pages that the user is most likely to click through. This mitigates the interruption that load times can introduce. In this paper we seek to make the first step towards predicting user commands in the IDE. Using the MSR 2018 Challenge Data of over 3000 developer session and over 10 million recorded events, we analyze and cleanse the data to be parsed into event series, which can then be used to train a variety of machine learning models, including a neural network, to predict user induced commands. Our highest performing model is able to obtain a 5 cross-fold validation prediction accuracy of 64%.",

Due to the use of the Java language, Web-based simulation can have such characteristics as reusability, portability and the capability of execution on the Web. Most of the existing Web-based simulation tools have focused mainly on the development of runtime simulation libraries and mechanisms on the Web. Thus, the model development work in such Web-based simulation tools still requires hand-written coding of model developers. This paper presents a visual model development environment for Web-based simulation. The proposed environment provides a framework for model development and animation. To show the effectiveness of the proposed environment we perform simulation experiments for transaction routing algorithms in a distributed transaction processing system.",

User applications transparently link to a device in an array of Xilinx PYNQ-Zl or-Z2 SoC hardware in the cloud. The viciLogic prototype builder toolsuite (which integrates with the Xilinx Vivado industry-standard EDA tools) automates online (and local) SoC digital logic hardware prototyping, with integrated viciLogic user interface. The platform supports real-time user hardware input signal control and automated signal control, and probes the state of all user design internal and output signals. This enables the creation of responsive client applications and smart browser-based courses. Online course functions include guided lessons, SoC signal state monitoring for automatic course progression, knowledge checks, and user sandbox. The prototype builder uses source VHDL or Verilog projects created, simulated and synthesised in Vivado. The builder parses and modifies the HDL model to provide signal observability, integrates SoC resources (ARM, AXI interconnect, peripherals and viciLogic IP), and (using Vivado) generates the SoC hardware configuration bitstream and design metadata. The paper describes the viciLogic 2.0 server architecture, SoC prototype builder tool flow, client application creator, and online course creator. Two demonstration applications are presented, a counter course lesson step and a client application (16-bit single cycle computer, with IDE).",

        "Abstract": "In our day to day life we are generating a lots of data, which has become a major problem to store those data in a local server or personal computer. In order to resolve this problem, we need many numbers of servers and networking which are more expensive of buying and which creates more complexity. To resolve this problem we are using the method called cloud computing, it provides IT resources as the service to the user over the internet and can use it on the basis of pay per usage. As it is a researching area of computer network technology, many of huge companies are providing the cloud services. According to the financial perspective, migration of data to the cloud remains trending now a days, but there are several other aspects that must be taken in to consideration before it is decided to do, among them the most important problem is security. Cloud computing security refers to the set of polices, technologies and controls over, applications and infrastructure of cloud computing. This paper tells us how to establish the data confidentiality, availability, security and integrity of shared data in multi cloud environment. So while providing the storage for cloud storage the providers repeatedly make sure the data confidentiality, by encrypting the content of the file by using encryption algorithm and certify the data integrity by cross checking the hash values of the file. Despite, when the cloud storage service fails, the availability of the user data cannot be certified and the cloud sharing function of the user data also cannot be supported. To overcome this users have to give full trust in existing schemes to the provider of the cloud storage service. If the provider system get hacked or becomes untrustworthy, the confidentiality of the user data will be exposed. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a scheme for securely storing and sharing data based on the improved proxy re-encryption algorithm in the multi cloud environment. Here the multi cloud storage is constructed to counter the failure of any single cloud, the symmetric encryption algorithm is used to encrypt the user files. The encryption key is accurately distributed with the Shamir's threshold secret sharing scheme by the general RSA algorithm. Finally the improved proxy re-encryption algorithm is advantage to support the sharing of encrypted user data via clouds. The pattern of the design is performed in the java development environment and is assessed under the assumed multi cloud environment. The experimental results of this design shows that, the time cost of the Shamir's secret partitioning process and symmetric encryption process about be negligible if the key size is greater than the 384 bytes, and the improved proxy re-encryption process takes about 1.5 seconds in an average.",

        "Abstract": "Different types of mobile development tools and frameworks to build web applications are constantly and rapidly emerging, making it difficult for developers to choose an appropriate one for their needs. In this work, we propose a novel framework to assess and benchmark development tools according to performance (and potentially dependability and security). The framework defines the components and procedures required to define and execute the benchmarks. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework, we implemented it for a concrete benchmark focused on assessing the performance of a representative application developed by different development tools. For this, we defined a representative set of features for the application and a set of relevant metrics to characterize their performance. The benchmarking campaign is executed on each application in an automated manner. The metrics are collected during the execution of the campaign and the results are then analyzed to compare the applications, their features, and the development tools that produced them. The results show that the same applications implemented in different frameworks are different in terms of software metrics and build time and show different performance when executing different functions (features) in terms of computation time, memory, and CPU usage. This reveals the effectiveness of the approach and the framework proposed to assess and compare the mobile development tools.",

        "Abstract": "Recent de velopments in wireless technologies and the internet have led consumers to conduct their business digitally. The digital transactions made through these systems can be monitored and carried out efficiently. This article focuses on the need for and construction of a digital web application system, which will help us establish a modern means to carry out the food business for homemakers. The main aim of our website “Cooked with Care Using MERN Stack” is to provide a digital platform for homemakers and mess-owners to provide good and clean food to consumers such as students or employees. Cooked with care is a platform that will provide housewives and restaurant owners the means to sell their products and services online with customer feedback for the provided services. Homemakers and mess owners can use the ordering system to update menu presentations and set up the system in a wireless environment. This research work has utilised MERN as the tech stack, where M stands for “MongoDB,” our database for holding customer and management data. \" E is an abbreviation for “ExpressJS,” which is utilised on our server. R is an abbreviation for “React,” which is a front-end programming language. N is an abbreviation for “NodeJS,” which refers to the complete programming environment. To save photos of menu items, the proposed work has leveraged AWS cloud storage. The resultant bills and invoices are generated by using the \"react-to-print\" library, and entries in an excel sheet using \"react-csv.\" Some issues are considered together with storing and removing the images from the AWS database via the admin panel, but it has ultimately rectified the issue and were able to conduct CRUD operations on it. This paper discusses about the design and implementation of our website, which would make it possible to reduce food wastage without using any manual effort and manpower.",

        "Abstract": "The communication of web services is typically organized through public APIs, which rely on a common data model shared among all system components. Over time, this data model must be changed in order to accommodate new or changing requirements, and the system components including the data they are operating on must be migrated. In practice, however, not all the affected components can be migrated instantly and at the same time. A common approach is to plan data model changes in a backward compatible fashion, which eventually causes serious maintenance problems and is a common cause of technical debt. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution to this problem by using a translation layer serving as a round-trip migration service which is responsible for the lossless forth-and-back translation of object-oriented data model instances of different versions. We present a framework which offers a version-aware interface definition language (IDL) for APIs, a typed JavaScript-based language for defining migration functions using the IDL definition, and a run-time environment for executing migrations. This is bundled into an integrated development environment assisting developers in implementing migration functions. From a methodological point of view, the development of round-trip migrations is supported by a catalog which comprises a set of typical data model evolution scenarios along with corresponding suitable round-trip migration strategies. We validate our framework by carrying out an extensive evaluation including a systematic assessment of expressiveness using our catalog, micro-benchmarking the performance of round-trip migrations, as well as a practical application in a case study of a real-world e-commerce web application obtained from an industrial partner.",

        "Abstract": "The authors have been studying ways to configure APLICOT (application platform for integrated database and data communication), a common in-house application program (AP) development environment with the aim of simplifying the job flow of in-house online system building at NTT. The authors report the techniques used to design AP interfaces (APIs) in the APLICOT project and also include an appraisal of their usefulness. APLICOT breaks down all of the different kinds of online application processing at NTT into six major types based on the processing types of messages and files. APLICOT then provides a set of 54 API parts for each type to standardize AP development environments. This set minimizes the total development cost of AP and these API parts. APLICOT's purpose is to standardize AP development support systems while allowing flexibility in the number of required AP programmers and in their tasks.<>",

        "Abstract": "Novel data-mining tasks in e-science involve mining of distributed, highly heterogeneous data and knowledge sources. However, standard data mining platforms, such as Weka and Orange, involve only their own data mining algorithms in the process of knowledge discovery from local data sources. In contrast, next generation data mining technologies should enable processing of distributed data sources, the use of data mining algorithms implemented as web services, as well as the use of formal descriptions of data sources and knowledge discovery tools in the form of ontologies, enabling automated composition of complex knowledge discovery workflows for a given data mining task. This paper proposes a novel Service-oriented Knowledge Discovery framework and its implementation in a service-oriented data mining environment Orange4WS (Orange for Web Services), based on the existing Orange data mining toolbox and its visual programming environment, which enables manual composition of data mining workflows. The new service-oriented data mining environment Orange4WS includes the following new features: simple use of web services as remote components that can be included into a data mining workflow; simple incorporation of relational data mining algorithms; a knowledge discovery ontology to describe workflow components (data, knowledge and data mining services) in an abstract and machine-interpretable way, and its use by a planner that enables automated composition of data mining workflows. These new features are showcased in three real-world scenarios.",

        "Abstract": "Computer consumers are the largest group of computer users, many of which are highly creative and experts in their area. Despite the fact they have no formal education in computer programming, they want to express their creativity and develop their own applications which will satisfy their needs. Nowadays, consumers can build their own personalized software artifacts using Geppeto (Widget Parallel Programming Tool) by building personalized workflows and dataflows over widgets, small standalone Web applications. However, computer consumers are prone to making mistakes while programming, which results in bugs in their applications. Consumers require assistance of skilled programmers in order to build dependable and error-free applications. This paper discusses new debugging methods based on professional debugging techniques, which will be understandable to average consumer. These methods will allow consumers controlled execution of their applications in order to find and remove bugs. Methods described in this paper are suitable for debugging consumer applications in a widget-oriented consumer programming environment like Geppeto, and include animated step-by-step execution of the consumer's application, adding breakpoints within widget composition and introducing interactive backtracking in order to detect erroneous widget.",

But still it's not implemented as its advantages due to many reason such as security problem, awareness of cloud and maintenance cost. But in future generation cloud may become number one choice because several advantages to its user. In my study cloud based health care system is implemented for storing, retrieving and updating patient's health record from Central cloud database server (Dive HQ). All hospitals store the patient's data to this Central cloud database server by using middle ware common platform within remote hospitals. Authentication server is also there to filter unauthorized users form accessing the site and to grant access for those authorized users. To develop my system, I have been used Net Beans IDE, MySQL, Apache Tomcat and other tools were used to develop the system.

        "Abstract": "Each EMS (energy management system) relies upon the SCADA system, which is characterized by a complexity of belonging HW & SW as well as the high costs. To preserve previous investments in a SCADA infrastructure, but to assure your SCADA/EMS system to \"hold a step\" with the innovations in this field, it's a good idea to build your system in a such manner to be open for future changes and upgrades. It can be achieved by using open development tools, capable to provide low-cost, long-lasting upgrades that can be performed from inside the Power Company. This paper describes a similar problem approach-the upgrade of an \"old\" SCADA system. Upgraded SCADA system comprises 19 new RTU's, ICCP data exchange with remote centers as well as the web-based real-time electricity demand metering, made for the first time within one Electricity Company in the South East Europe. A complete upgrade & integration of the existing SCADA software with the new SCADA features and advanced network technologies that are presented here were achieved thanks to the selected programming tools: MS Visual Basic, PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) and MySQL. The choice of these tools was a \"king pin\" of the successful implementation and upgrade of the control system",

Currently, most analysis techniques are implemented as independent tools, or plugins for integrate development environment (IDE, e.g., Eclipse). However, in this paper, we introduce a new way to release the analyzing ability: a Web Service based approach, which can integrate multiple analysis tools, and provides analyzing ability by way of standard Web Service interface. The user can benefit code analyzing ability by just submit the code to be analyzed to the service, without download any analyzing tools, and then get the merged result. The experiment shows that the proposed approach is feasible and efficient.",

        "Abstract": "Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) web application frameworks have become significantly popular in web development, by providing built-in libraries which could help developers to write codes without writing them from scratch. Because of their popularities, most developers are required to have solid knowledge on using the available frameworks. To create a dynamic and real-time web application, most of the developers use Ajax technology due to what it is capable of. However, most of the existing PHP frameworks do not have built-in Ajax libraries where users need to implement their own Ajax request. Therefore, in this paper, we develop a new PHP web application development framework based on the Model View Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and Ajax technology. The framework itself implements Ajax technology with its built-in library. After conducting this research, we concluded that the new PHP web application framework could be used as a web application development tool to help users to create a dynamic and real-time web application.",

Thus, a fault tree graphic drawing software based on Visio Drawing Control 2007 has been proposed by using C# language and Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 development environment for secondary development. Moreover, Visio Viewer Control helps display fault tree by means of Web browser. Development practice shows that the combination of secondary development of fault tree drawing software under the C/S mode and display fault tree under the Browser/Server(B/S) mode has effectively improved the using scope and scalability of the fault tree.

        "Abstract": "At ISB Atma Luhur, there is a web application specifically for students in accessing academic information in which the usage is good enough, but felt less practical and effective. After logged in, a student must provide some input, such as clicking on buttons and menus to display academic information. This web application interface is felt too small if opened by using a mobile browser that causes some students to experience difficulty in tapping buttons or menus. The solution that can be offered to overcome this problem is to use an Android-based chatbot. The chatbot can simplify the process of accessing information, i.e., by chatting on chatbot application and its interface size is adjusted according to the user device. The used model, method, and software development tools, respectively, are prototype models, object-oriented methods, and UML (Unified Modeling Language). The created chatbot apply NLP (Natural Language Processing) algorithm and entity extraction method, so that chatbot can respond appropriately and according to requests from students. The created chatbot makes the academic information at ISB Atma Luhur can be accessed easily, quickly, and efficiently by students without having to zoom in and zoom out.",

This task has become increasingly challenging as most web contents are now generated by processing ever-growing amount of user data stored in back-end databases. It is difficult for developers to understand the cost of generating every web-page element, not to mention explore and pick the web design with the best trade-off between performance and functionality. In this paper, we present Panorama, a view-centric and database-aware development environment for web developers. Using database-aware program analysis and novel IDE design, Panorama provides developers with intuitive information about the cost and the performance-enhancing opportunities behind every HTML element, as well as suggesting various global code refactorings that enable developers to easily explore a wide spectrum of performance and functionality trade-offs.",

        "Abstract": "Current providers of the cloud storage service often ensure the data confidentiality by encrypting the file content and guarantee the data integrity by verifying the hash value of the file. However, when the cloud storage service fails, the availability of the user data cannot be guaranteed and nor can the cloud sharing function of the user data be supported. In addition, users have to give the provider of the cloud storage service full trust in existing schemes. Once the provider system is hacked or becomes untrustworthy, the confidentiality of the user data will be threatened. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a scheme for securely storing and sharing data based on the proxy re-encryption algorithm in the multi-cloud environment. In this scheme, the multi-cloud storage is designed to prevent the failure of any single cloud, the symmetric encryption algorithm is used to encrypt user files, the encryption key is reliably distributed with the Shamir's threshold secret sharing scheme, and finally the proxy re-encryption algorithm is leveraged to support sharing of the encrypted data via clouds. The prototype of the scheme is implemented in the Java development environment and is evaluated under the simulated multi-cloud environment. Our experimental results show that, the time cost of the Shamir's secret partitioning process and symmetric encryption process almost can be negligible when the key size is as long as 386 bytes, and the proxy re-encryption process takes about 1.6 seconds in average.",

        "Abstract": "Although visual programming techniques have been used to lower the threshold of programming for end users, they are not sufficient for creating end user programming environments that are both easy to use and powerful. To achieve this, an environment must support the definition of programs that are not just static representations of behavior, but are instead dynamic collections of program objects which can be applied in a number of contexts rather than just a program editor. We describe an approach to end user programming called tactile programming which extends visual techniques with a unified program manipulation paradigm that makes programs easy to comprehend, compose and, most importantly, share over the World Wide Web. Tactile programming's inherent ability to support the social context in which programming takes place along with its ability to ease program comprehension and composition is what differentiates this approach from others. In the context of the Agentsheets programming substrate, we have created an instance of a tactile programming environment called Visual AgenTalk which is used to create interactive simulations.",

        "Abstract": "While Object-Oriented programming in Java has been widely adopted as an introductory programming course in Computer Science, it is considered difficult to teach and learn. Studies have identified that the difficulty is from the underlying Object-Oriented concepts and principles. To help student programmers better understand the structure of a program and the concepts of Object-Oriented design, visualizations in various formats have been applied to programming environments. This paper presents a web-based interactive educational programming environment, JavlinaCode, and its unique design principles. JavlinaCode is designed for teaching object-oriented programming in Java. It aims to enhance student programmers' programming skill and to help them understand object-oriented design concepts. It provides integrated static and dynamic visualizations: the static state of a Java program in an UML class diagram and the dynamic run-time state of the program execution. With the synchronized multi-view real time visualization along with source code, JavelinaCode is highly expected to reduce student programmers' cognitive workload in Java programming and to enhance comprehension of the objectoriented programming and design concepts.",

        "Abstract": "Monitoring a factory remotely over the Internet introduces a variety of issues: how to capture the factory's data in a Web-accessible database, locate the data from anywhere in the world, display it locally using a Web browser, protect private data during transmission, and shield it from unauthorized viewing. Solving those problems from scratch would be difficult, but fortunately that is not necessary. Using techniques developed for electronic commerce-including universal data access, a ubiquitous programming environment, data security and user authentication-all of these requirements can be met. The authors discuss these techniques, then show how they are used in combination to create a data monitoring system for a simulated petrochemical plant.",

        "Abstract": "Software engineering involves a lot of change as code artifacts are not only created once but maintained over time. In the last 25 years, major paradigms of program development have arisen – agile development with refactorings, software product lines, moving sequential code to multicore or cloud, etc. Each is centered on particular kinds of change; their conceptual foundations rely on transformations that (semi-) automate these changes. We are exploring how transformations can be placed at the center of software development in future IDEs, and when such a view can provide benefits over the traditional view. COPE, a Change-Oriented Programming Environment, looks at 5 activities: (1) analyze what changes programmers typically make and how they perceive, recall, and communicate changes, (2) automate transformations to make it easier to apply and script changes, (3) develop tools that compose and manipulate transformations to make it easier to reuse them, (4) integrate transformations with version control to pro- vide better ways for archiving and understanding changes, and (5) develop tools that infer higher-level transformations from lower-level changes. Characterizing software develop- ment in terms of transformations is an essential step to take software engineering from manual development to (semi-) automated development of software.",

        "Abstract": "Weather Monitoring is one of the important aspects with respect to weather prediction as well as for many other tasks like traffic management etc. Monitoring weather with the help of weather stations situated at different places can help us in keeping the weather data of that particular location up-to-date which in return can help us in future predictions and the current situation of the atmosphere around that location. Currently, there are many weather stations deployed in the required location but most of them are manual or have a very high cost for installation moreover there are not many weather sensing devices that are pocket-friendly and easy to carry, which can sense data without a live connection solely on basis of a VCC. There are many devices that will sense weather data, store them and send alerts based on analyzed data, but not many devices will sense data solely and provide them to the user. Such devices can be used while traveling in remote areas or to measure the weather parameters of remote/developed areas and display them publicly. Recently, there are no such pocket-friendly devices for the same. This paper aims to measure and analyze real-time weather data. The proposed system attempts to devise an IoT technology that shall detect humidity, temperature, barometric pressure, and rainfall around the location wherein the weather station is fixed. All this data is detected by different sensors that are been mounted on the weather station and after the detection, the data is uploaded on a web page. When the program gets uploaded one can fetch the IP address of Node MCU on the serial monitor of Arduino IDE. The IP address can be pasted on any authorized web browser and present the fetched weather parameters onto the neat GUI. The proposed system was successfully executed and all the parameters were fetched accurately with an accuracy of 95%. The system is pocket-friendly and very easy to use and set up. The system achieves all the objectives successfully and was tested successfully.",

The 3DCG production skill is becoming one of mandatory technical capabilities for IT engineers. The learning aids such as text books and related web pages consist of captured 2D images for understanding 3DCG theories and program codes for explaining specific algorithms. The learners should work with multiple materials and tools including the books, some tools for learning 3D modeling, rendering, and animation, and a development tool for acquiring graphics programming skill. These efforts require enormous amount of time and impose a heavy burden on the learners. To solve the problem, we have been developing a self-contained 3DCG learning support system. It helps the learners to intuitively acquire the 3DCG production skills through a hands-on graphics programming environment.",

Through interviews with library and information science students who have completed a web development course, we explore coding challenges that novices face and the emergence of strategies in response to them. Our results reveal that challenges arise from abstractions present in web development and their mismatch with WYSIWYG interfaces. These findings suggest new avenues for the design of web development tools that support the transitioning of non-coders into active web developers.",

Web survey is widely used to gather user opinions on various purposes. However, most such systems are plain-text, and sometimes with a few graphical images. This paper presents an innovative Multimedia-Based and Time-Sensitive Interactive (MTI) Web Survey to collect user opinions on the traffic condition. Open source development tools and emerging web technologies, such as PHP and AJAX, are used in implementing the system to achieve event-sensitive user opinions. This MTI web survey, though presented and illustrated by using road user opinion on traffic condition data, is a general technique that can be applied to any time-sensitive data collection. The usability testing on MTI web survey was also conducted to gain insights on usage issues and the results are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Researchers have developed numerous debugging approaches to help programmers in the debugging process, but these approaches are rarely used in practice. In this paper, we investigate how programmers debug their code and what researchers should consider when developing debugging approaches. We conducted an online questionnaire where 102 programmers provided information about recently fixed bugs. We found that the majority of bugs (69.6 %) are semantic bugs. Memory and concurrency bugs do not occur as frequently (6.9 % and 8.8 %), but they consume more debugging time. Locating a bug is more difficult than reproducing and fixing it. Programmers often use only IDE build-in tools for debugging. Furthermore, programmers frequently use a replication-observation-deduction pattern when debugging. These results suggest that debugging support is particularly valuable for memory and concurrency bugs. Furthermore, researchers should focus on the fault localization phase and integrate their tools into commonly used IDEs.",

Dealing with web application or website security issues requires deep insight and planning, not only because of the many tools that are available but also because of the industry immaturity. Thus, finding the proper tools requires deep understanding and several steps, including analyzing the development environment, business needs, and the web applications' complexity. In this paper, we demonstrate the architecture of web applications then list and evaluate the widespread security vulnerabilities. Those vulnerabilities are: Insufficient Transport Layer Protection, Information Leakage, Cross-Site Scripting, and SQL Injection. In addition, this paper analyzes the tools that are used to scan for these widespread vulnerabilities in web applications. Finally, it evaluates tools due to security vulnerabilities and gives recommendations to the web applications' users and administrators aiming to educate them.",

Existing development environments provide limited support for the development of code auto-generation features, and configuration of the auto-generated code itself. Herein a tool is presented that supports the VCL framework that aims to reduce development cost while also facilitating efficient learning of VCL and its auto-generation framework. In this work, the V ACVIS tool is developed to encourage exploration through the hierarchical structure of the VCL framework in a visual and interactive approach. Visualizations aid developers in understanding the framework during the development process, hence enhancing the auto-generation and maintenance of the systems produced with VCL. The tool developed is further enhanced and integrated into Visual Studio IDE as an extension.",

However, current recommender systems limit the context analysis to change history and developers' activities in the IDE, without considering what a developer has already consulted or perused, e.g., by performing searches from the Web browser. Given the faceted nature of many programming tasks, and the incompleteness of the information provided by a single artifact, several heterogeneous resources are required to obtain the broader picture needed by a developer to accomplish a task. We present Libra, a holistic recommender system. It supports the process of searching and navigating the information needed by constructing a holistic meta-information model of the resources perused by a developer, analyzing their semantic relationships, and augmenting the web browser with a dedicated interactive navigation chart. The quantitative and qualitative evaluation of Libra provides evidence that a holistic analysis of a developer's information context can indeed offer comprehensive and contextualized support to information navigation and retrieval during software development.",

        "Abstract": "Consumer-oriented programming allows consumers that are not professional developers to create personalized software artifacts. Consumer-oriented applications are exposed to consumers through gadgets, small applications displayed in a Web browser. Consumers choose a preferred set of gadgets and build personalized workflows on top of the gadgets by interacting them through a graphical user interface. Consumer's application is being built using Geppeto (Gadget Parallel Programming Tool), consumer-oriented framework for programming workflows of consumer's applications. Consumer-oriented applications have to satisfy two main requirements: ease of use and adequate set of functionalities. Furthermore, all functionalities of the given application have to be exposed as graphical user-interface elements of the gadgets, to provide simple way of gadget composition for consumers. Demands on consumer-oriented applications are explained through consumer-oriented application for statistical processing. Each gadget implements one statistical function. Consumers can generate their own gadgets as compositions of existing gadgets using Geppeto. The system implements functionalities of data fetching, statistical data processing, displaying the results of data processing as well as defining events and actions triggered by those events.",

First, a standardized storage specification for interactive interfaces is proposed, which expands the existing CIM/G specifications to achieve cross-system and cross-software analysis and display of interactive interfaces; Then, it provides a graphical development tool for applications (APP), which can be used to achieve rapid and fine-grained development of applications that comply with cloud terminal specifications, and explores the use of cloud terminals for full life cycle management of application services; Finally, the standard human-computer interaction specification is discussed, and the undifferentiated invocation of data and services is realized by standardizing the structure of interactive messages. The developed human-machine cloud terminal can break the limitation of the existing localization of the dispatching system, realize the undifferentiated display of the dispatching interface and the undifferentiated call of the cloud platform application service.",

LiveTalk permits multiple users separated across the wide area to interact with separate copies of a single application, sharing a single virtual workspace, using very little network bandwidth. LiveTalk features an integrated, browser-based programming environment with native graphics and live evaluation, an integrated, pluggable web server, and a simple messaging service that serves to coordinate activity on shared application sessions, and provides for multiple, mutually-isolated sessions. The first use case for LiveTalk are collaborative big-data visualizations running on thin-client devices such as cellular phones, tablets, and netbooks. These applications form part of a new class of application where the distributed Cloud is leveraged to provide low latency, and high-bandwidth access to geographically disparate users while maintaining the feel of immediacy associated with local computation. The primary motivation of this work is to permit low latency, collaborative applications to be built quickly and easily, while requiring no setup for use by the end-user.",

Teachers rely on simple educational robots and intuitive programming environments and graphical programming environments have become a frequent starting point for young robotics new bies. However, currently available tools do often not sufficiently support teachers and students in the classroom. In this study, we evaluate programming environments for educational robots, our results point to the need of lowering the complexity of tools as well as of incorporating combinations of web and cloud technologies, embedded systems and communication concepts into these environments. The technical part of this work presents Open Roberta -- an open source based addition to commercial educational robot environments that addresses these needs.",

In order to enable end-users to define a series of tasks by combining multiple Web resources, it is necessary to provide an orchestration environment for Web applications. A spreadsheet is one of the most popular applications for office workers. It provides an end- user programming environment. In this paper, we propose a spreadsheet-based environment for end-users to orchestrate multiple Web applications. First, we provide a method for embedding various Web resources in spreadsheet cells as visual components in order to reuse them on the spreadsheet. Second, we propose an access method for embedded components using the special function in the formula language. Our approach enables users to define the complex coordination of multiple Web applications on the spreadsheet using the formula language.",

World-Wide web supplies a standard open interface to the world regardless of the machine type. Through this interface Web servers can be used either as computation nodes or coordinators managing other connected nodes of the virtual machine.

        "Abstract": "This paper presents phpModeler, a tool for reverse engineering of legacy php web applications that generates static UML diagrams showing resources which the current web page is using, its functions and dependencies it has on other web pages. Once the models describing individual web pages have been generated, phpModeler can analyze them and generate dependency models that for each entity in every page model show all entities dependent on it. phpModeler can also be used to highlight the difference between page models - a feature that, when combined with a SVN repository shows the way how the current web page has evolved over time. phpModeler is a plugin for the Eclipse IDE.",

        "Abstract": "The pharmaceutical field is of paramount importance to the health sector, especially designed to provide pharmaceutical Web services to pharmacists, doctors, nurses and also to the general public. At present, the pharmaceutical Web services are described in a syntactic way (expressed in natural language) and therefore difficult to treat by the machine, so it is necessary to use semantic web service techniques by the construction of pharmaceutical ontological resources and adding semantic to the pharmaceutical web services. In our work, we built two ontologies, the first ontology named “Pharmaceutical domain ontology”, it was created by following the “METHONTOLOGY” method and using “OWL language” and “OWL-PROTÉGÉ” tool. The second ontology named “Pharmaceutical Web services ontology”, it was created by using OWL-S language and OWLS-E-P tool (OWL-S EDITOR for PROTÉGÉ), to implement the Web services we use “NetBeans IDE”. The construction of these ontologies is very important to improve the quality of healthcare services.",

        "Abstract": "Organizations who have transitioned their development environments to the Cloud have started realizing benefits such as: cost reduction in hardware; relatively accelerated development process via reduction of time and effort to set up development and testing environments; unified management; service and functionality expansion; on-demand provisioning and access to resources and development environments. These benefits represent only a fraction of the full potential that could be achieved via leveraging Cloud Computing for the collaborative software development process. Related efforts in this area have been mainly in the areas of: asynchronous collaboration; collaboration in isolated aspects of the Software Development process, such as coding activities; use of open-source tools for contributing, improving, and managing code, etcetera. Although these efforts represent valid contributions and important enablers, they are still missing important aspects which enable a more holistic process, with solid theoretical foundation. This paper reviews this research area, in order to better assess factors and gaps creating the need to enhance the collaborative software development process in the Cloud, to better meet the pressure to collaboratively create better cloud-agnostic applications.",

There is a need for a Web-based Patient health monitoring system, when the patient is not in the Hospital. Such a system will enable the doctors to monitor the physiological parameters online and take necessary action in emergency. In this paper, a prototype of basic physiological parameter monitoring system based on Arduino and Raspberry Pi microcontroller boards is implemented. Various basic physiological parameters such as blood pressure, heartbeat, oxygen saturation in Blood (SPO2), body temperature and fall detection are measured using relevant sensors and sent to the Arduino microcontroller board for further processing. The computed parameters are then sent to a Raspberry Pi based Web server for display on the web page. ZigBee is used for communication between Arduino and Raspberry Pi. The necessary software is developed using Arduino IDE and Python language. The measured physiological parameters are updated every 60 seconds. The updated parameter values can be viewed from anywhere using an internet enabled device. Also, when the value of the physiological parameters exceeds certain threshold, the caretaker is alerted through SMS. This system is especially helpful for elderly and ill patients.",

However, early systems don't support open environments and interoperability. It is difficult to access diverse data sources which provide each spatial data format. These systems also have difficulty upgrading the function and reducing the cost of developing Web GIS applications. We design and implement an open Web GIS service system based on the Web GIS architecture of OGC (OpenGIS Consortium). This system provides interoperability, an open environment, and a spatial data transfer format based on XML. In addition, it satisfies various user requirements and reusability of developed software because it supports Web GIS services as components. Each service component is composed of many objects accomplishing atomic service processing and cooperating with each other. Web GIS service components are designed with UML (Unified Modeling Language), an object-oriented modeling language for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting artifacts of a software system. In addition, they were also developed in an object-oriented computing environment, ATL/COM and Visual C++, and provide interoperability, language-independence, and an easy development environment in addition to reusability.",

        "Abstract": "Many IoT applications require public information and private information to make correct decision and trigger appropriate services in efficient manner. Many existing IoT services use cloud-based service model. Cloud-based service model conducts logic decision on remote servers, which store public and private information, and leads to security and privacy breakage. Moreover, it limits the users on controlling the services. The tradeoff between data privacy and intelligent service is an important issue on developing IoT services. In this paper, we present a public/private federation framework, which combines public and private intelligence to develop IoT applications. It allows the IoT applications to take advantage of the cloud-based public intelligence and local private data to provide correct services without transmitting private data to public servers. The framework is built on top of an intelligent virtual middleware, named WuKong, to federate with nodeRED, which is a web-enabled flow-based programming environment. Two case examples are shown in the paper to demonstrate how the private and public intelligence are inter-woven to compose intelligent IoT applications.",

        "Abstract": "SCEPPSys is a distributed pair programming system especially designed to support the application of pair programming in computer science courses. Compared to other implementations, SCEPPSys enables students to solve programming assignments guided by collaboration scripts. This approach exploits the benefits of collaborative learning in pair programming, and aims to maximize learning outcomes by structuring the problem-solving process. The system consists of a shared programming environment, which runs as a part of the Eclipse IDE, and a web-based administration environment. The main focus of this paper is to present an overview of the system and a detailed description of the features of the administration section, which contains an authoring tool for collaboration scripts and instructional support tools. The incorporation of various group formation strategies and the analysis of students' interactions make this software particularly useful for educators as well as researchers.",

In this work, the text message with the different payloads is encrypted and decrypted. Similarly, the same process repeated for audio data. First, the text, and audio data are converted into string format; then the data format is encrypted using different cryptography methods from the sender side. On the receiver side, same cryptography method is used to decrypt the data with a generated key associated among the parties. In the case of symmetric ciphers, AES, Blowfish, DES, and IDEA are used to encrypt and decrypt the data. Further, the asymmetric ciphers, RSA, ECC, and DSA are used to encrypt and decrypt the data. LabVIEW programming tools are used to develop a scheme of cryptography methods. Finally, latency analysis is made on text, and audio data with symmetric and asymmetric ciphers.",

In doing so, the authors specialize in the processing of specific signals related processes in geotechnology. In the first part of this paper are characterized appropriate mathematical starting points, using which was compiled web application. The application solves the mutual comparison of each input element-vector with reference elements and using inner product and mathematical view of these elements, to each element is assigned a corresponding position in three-dimensional Euclidean vector space. On the basis of this application was in our department designed and implemented web service Nto3Service. The term web service refers to the technologies that allow for making connections. A service is the endpoint of a connection. Also, a service has some type of underlying computer system that supports the connection offered [1]. A detailed description of the design of web service is a content of second part of the paper. It covers the purpose of the service, description of the various methods of service and their parameters, structure of the web service, the web service output structures, a description of the error states and a description of the WSDL (web services description language) file. Next part of the contribution specifies the implementation of the web service and how to create a service client. In the description of the presentation application of web service are listed its various functions, illustrative example and applications areas. The final part of the contribution summarizes the results obtained and how to use them to solve practical problems by different users in different development environments.",

Although the technology is well specified and supported by the programming tools, it is still not widely used. Some of the main reasons are the difficulties which the end users have in searching an adequate web service to get the required data. Even if found, the web service rarely fit the exact needs. This paper presents a new framework for dynamical generation of the web services from the heterogeneous data sources on user's demand. The aim of the framework is to generate web services that are customized to the particular requirements. Apart from specifying the requirements in WSDL, the framework proposes the ontology for describing the available data.",

There are various services which are being offered for various kinds of requirements for the customers. Cloud broker would be very much engaged in providing profitable outcomes for both the Cloud service provider and the end user. The major problem dealt in cloud computing environment is the lack in utilization of resources due to delay in processing of user request. Our goal is to maximize resource utilization with efficient scheduling strategy. There are various scheduling algorithms for performing scheduling of resources based on the needs of the service provider. In our paper we implement Delay time algorithm which is having its efficient significance in scheduling and allocating the resources effectively. We deploy our cloud environment with Cloud Simulator tool and we use Netbeans IDE and Xampp server for processing with our scheduling process. We can be able to prove that Delay time algorithm (DTA) would be superior to the various scheduling algorithms in terms of efficient resource utilization.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel, robust, scalable, and open-source online code execution system called Judge0. It features a modern modular architecture that can be deployed over an arbitrary number of computers and operating systems. We study its design, comment on the various challenges that arise in building such systems, compare it with other available online code execution systems and online judge systems, and finally comment on several scenarios how it can be used to build a wide range of applications varying from competitive programming platforms, educational and recruitment platforms, to online code editors. Though first presented now, Judge0 is in active use since October 2017 and has become a crucial part of several production systems.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we discuss an approach used to develop a schedule management system which is manageable at low cost. It is designed using Google App Engine (GAE) and the Go programming language. The system is available for general purposes. GAE provides the execution environment, database called BigTable, and development tools. Developers can concentrate on writing applications because they can skip traditional construction of the development environment. GAE supports Python, Java, Go and PHP. Python and Java are in common use. Go is considered as a promising language because it is designed for ease of programming, and has modern features such as a garbage-collector and built-in support for concurrency. Employing this approach, we developed the system in a short span of time because server or database management are not necessary. System development on the cloud environment is still not common compared to traditional way, but this technology has many advantages, crucial for modern IT business.",

        "Abstract": "For the education of beginning programmers, visual programming that develops programs by combining blocks has attracted significant attention. An environment for generating code in a conventional programming language is also provided. However, existing environments are not fully visualized. In this investigation, we prototyped a development environment for the C language in which users can intuitively understand the concept of variable declarations and include statements, and an execution environment that visualizes the state of evaluation of expressions and changes in the values of variables before and after the execution of the statement. It also has step-forward and step-backward functions. This programming environment is a web application developed with JavaScript. For step-by-step evaluation of an expression, it converts the expression internally to reverse Polish notation and visualizes the change in the terms in the expression. To implement the step-backward function, it has a history-of-execution context. We determined experimentally that students who are not proficient in C can program more accurately and quickly in this environment than with text-based coding.",

        "Abstract": "For years, playing video on the Web has generally required using one of the three applications: Apple's QuickTime, Microsoft's Windows Media Player, or Real Networks' RealPlayer. Now, though, the Big Three players face a challenger that initially became well-known for uses that had nothing to do with video: Adobe (formerly Macromedia) Flash. Even before Adobe's $3.4 billion buyout of Macromedia, Flash - once just a Web site animation tool $was expanding into online video. Now that Flash has access to Adobe's clout and resources, as well as new technology, proponents hope this process will accelerate. However, Flash is considerably smaller than its competitors and offers faster download speeds. It is also tightly integrated with the well-regarded Flash multimedia-development environment. Nonetheless, Flash's strengths are already making the technology a prominent part of the online-video landscape, a process that could continue if Adobe keeps improving it. The new Flash 8 environment, released in August 2005, includes Flash Player 8 and Flash Professional 8, a set of content-creation tools. According to analysts, Flash is likely to become increasingly successful in the on-demand streaming segment of the video-player market but probably won't expand into other areas unless major features are added.",

Light, 2003) have emerged with fundamental features such as, process definition, and process publication including organizational process manuals and online documentation. However, the major tools are lacking features such as the enactment of multiple methodologies in one project, the reuse of project assets for project performance, and the quantitative project management with the purpose of development process improvement in both project and organization level. For this reason, we have built the PRiME system, which is software process & project management system based on SPEM (software process engineering metamodel) (http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/spem.htm) compliant software development methodologies. It basically supports the effective definition, reference, implementation, and enhancement of methodology providing the integrated functionalities in software development project. Also its primary sub-systems have been built as a pluggable component type, called eclipse plug-in within the eclipse PDE (plug-in development environment) for compatibility with CASE or software development tools.",

This paper describes some of the features of the developed universal SFC graphical editor, which includes: 1. editor architecture; 2. graphical user interface; 3. SFC schema validation and compilation to various targets; 4. editor customization and integration to development tools of various control systems. REX uses the SFC editor in two ways: 1. a design tool for the ATMT, EATMT and REXLANG function blocks; 2. as an online visualization and debugging tool.",

        "Abstract": "A DELPHI questionnaire study of the management problems of Internet/Web systems development was completed in 2001 and its results have been reported in the literature. The most important problems collectively consist of a cluster of problems involving Internet strategic planning and other strategy-related problems. This cluster includes 4 of the first 5 problems and a total of 7 of the top 16. Other recent research studies have reached similar conclusions about the high importance of strategy considerations in the field of high-tech product development, where strategic planning for new product development was found to be the top problem. High-tech product development occurs in a different operating (and usually mutually exclusive) environment from that of Internet/Web systems (Web systems) development in that the former involves R&D, engineering, and production activities and produces a (usually) physical product suited for the marketplace, whereas Web systems development creates systems for internal use by the developing company, using analysis and development tools and methodologies that differ significantly from those of traditional IT systems development. However, the new-product development activities and Web systems development activities also have a great deal in common: each takes place in a highly uncertain, rapidly changing, complex, advanced-technology environment that is difficult for other managers to understand and properly consider during the strategy planning processes. A large body of knowledge has emerged about strategic planning and management of new-product development, but no such body of knowledge has yet emerged with respect to Web systems development strategic planning activities. This article is directed to strategic planning management knowledge transfer from the high-tech product development arena to the field of Web systems development. The article first describes, and then compares the processes of both activities. Then considered is how high-tech product development planning and management practices can be used for Web systems development.",

        "Abstract": "Software development has become a fundamental process on any business or organization. As a consequence, together with other emergent technologies, new development platforms (IDEs) are being created, mainly in the cloud (e.g., Eclipse Orion, Cloud9, Codio), requiring different approaches on the way software development can be studied. Empirical studies on software development most often are based on data taken from software configuration management repositories, source code management systems and issue tracking tools, but not from the IDEs themselves, because they do not record data publically regarding developers' activities. We aim to bring forward new insights on the software development process by analyzing how developers use their IDE. Based upon process mining techniques such as process discovery and conformance checking, this missing perspective will hopefully allow the discovery of coding patterns, the search for programmer behaviors and the detection of deviations from prescribed processes. Finally, we expect to provide advice for individual software process enhancement.",

        "Abstract": "Modern IDEs contain sophisticated components for inferring missing types, correcting bad syntax and completing partial expressions in code, but they are limited to the context that is explicitly defined in a project's configuration. These tools are ill-suited for quick prototyping of incomplete code snippets, such as those found on the Web in Q&A forums or walk-through tutorials, since such code snippets often assume the availability of external dependencies and may even contain implicit references to an execution environment that provides data or compute services. We propose an architecture for smart programming playgrounds that can facilitate rapid prototyping of incomplete code snippets through a semi-automatic context resolution that involves identifying static dependencies, provisioning external resources on the cloud and injecting resource bindings to handles in the original code fragment. Such a system could be potentially useful in a range of different scenarios, from sharing code snippets on the Web to experimenting with new ideas during traditional software development.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents the IOPT2SS tool, used to automatically generate state-space graphs associated with IOPT (Input-Output Place-Transition) Petri nets models. The new tool accounts with the non autonomous nature of the IOPT Petri net class, where transition firing is constrained by external input events and input signals (expressed in transition guards); on the other hand, transitions can trigger the occurrence of output signal events and place marking can activate output signals. To achieve the performance level necessary for the fast generation of complex state-spaces during reasonable time, the tool employs a compilation strategy, starting with the automatic creation of an optimized C program. When executed, the program will create an hierarchical XML file containing the state-space graph. The output XML file can subsequently be used for model checking and property analysis, applying standard XML query languages. Finally, the output file can be converted to SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), enabling the graphical visualization of small to medium size state-space graphs. The new tool was implemented using a set of XSL transformations and can be used as a standalone tool or as a building block in higher level frameworks, with easy integration in Web applications and graphical integrated development environments.",

        "Abstract": "Conventionally, a grid generator requires either explicit or without explicit description about the boundary vertices, boundary lines and boundary faces to define the geometry, whereby a CAD system or an anisotropic grid generation with intersection-based geometry interface can be deployed to generate grids. Whatever the case, this compute intensive process, quite often, has a non-interactive, non-Web-based interface and without instant visualization. While grid generator can be used to generate grid geometry art, any 2D image editing program can also be deployed, nevertheless, the result is a static display of a pixel- or vector-based image. This paper describes an interactive Web-based visualization as a fundamental medium for visualization, one that changes the way grid geometry art are being visualized, developed, generated and delivered. The author first provides relevant background of grid geometry art, discusses several existing methodologies and their inadequacy currently used within the Web environments. She offers a new paradigm -- a Web-based interactive development tool that integrates an interface for exploration, structuring and dissemination of visualization results for grid geometry art. Such is an instant conceptualization and artistic interpretation of an image as an arrangement of an uniform m x n grid of colored cells: quadrilaterals formed within a set of finite orthogonal grids. The parameter-driven algorithm with minimal user setup for \"automatic\" idea generation provides the tools for constructing De Stijl, Abstraction Geometry -- Concentric Squares geometrical objects from numerical arrays not only makes and manipulates, it distributes geometric shapes over planes, as well as performs color and rectangular shape transformations. The author briefly discusses the tool, demonstrates and renders specific examples of the art thus created as she illustrates the advantages of using a single tool to embrace the structuring and delivery of a garden variety of grid geometry art.",

Bioinformatics applications can highly benefit from grid computing power, but the challenges of exposing these applications to the grid often cause reluctance. Typical bioinformatics applications are \"quick-and-dirty\" Perl scripts, which usually run at small homegrown laboratory clusters. Our work intends to fill the gap between grid power and the bioinformatics world by utilizing Web services and by extending the Open-Bioinformatics Foundation's software package BioPerl. Our extensions to BioPerl libraries allow bioinformatics applications to be exposed to Web services seamlessly. Our development tool WSDL2Perl integrates these applications with the vast computational power of the NC BioGrid. We present a case study in building Web services for bioinformatics applications, namely BLAST (a well-known standard homology search application), and a process for deploying grid-enabled Web services to the NC BioGrid.",

The emerging real-time web is based on web feeds-streams of real-time information usually implemented using RSS/Atom protocols. Since real-time content is torrential, web users who follow a large number of web feeds usually overwhelm their feed-readers with content they are not able to handle in a reasonable time. The goal of the Erl-metafeed is to provide a platform for scalable management of web feeds in near real-time. The prototype is implemented in Erlang programming language because of its concurrency support and soft real-time execution. Erl-metafeed is programmable using custom query language available via web interface. Additionally, since textual query language is not suitable for end-users, we designed and implemented set of web widgets on top of the Geppeto programming environment. Geppeto environment enables intuitive composition of widgets into powerful mashups, thus circumventing need for learning query language.",

The course, M206 Computing: An Object-Oriented Approach has been specifically developed for distance learning, and is enrolling over 5,000 students per year (average age 37) in the UK, Europe and Singapore. The course introduces computing via an object-oriented approach. M206 is substantial in extent representing one sixth of a degree. It embodies a practical, industry oriented view of computing and includes programming, analysis, design and group working. Considerable effort has been invested in making the simplicity, consistency and power of object technology accessible to and capable of being applied by beginners. A diverse set of educational media, such as CD-ROMs, TV and the Web, have been deployed as learning resources. We describe the agenda for the course; its object-oriented pedagogy and our strategy for delivery. We explain measures taken to avoid misconceptions about objects, our analysis and design method, and the Smalltalk programming environment we have developed specifically for learners and which is crucial to our approach. We outline how our adherence to the separation of view and domain model leads to technical innovations. Concluding remarks reflect on the benefits a reflexive strategy, both in education and training.",

In this paper, we present an empirical cost/benefit analysis of two different categories of automated functional web testing approaches: (1) capture-replay web testing (in particular, using Selenium IDE); and, (2) programmable web testing (using Selenium WebDriver). On a set of six web applications, we evaluated the costs of applying these testing approaches both when developing the initial test suites from scratch and when the test suites are maintained, upon the release of a new software version. Results indicate that, on the one hand, the development of the test suites is more expensive in terms of time required (between 32% and 112%) when the programmable web testing approach is adopted, but on the other hand, test suite maintenance is less expensive when this approach is used (with a saving between 16% and 51%). We found that, in the majority of the cases, after a small number of releases (from one to three), the cumulative cost of programmable web testing becomes lower than the cost involved with capture-replay web testing and the cost saving gets amplified over the successive releases.",

        "Abstract": "The study of interaction data and learning experiences in education has the potential to allow the analysis of why students pass or fail a course or where a course can be improved. In the special case of programming courses for beginners, analyzing the behaviour of students while coding, is essential but not always possible. To avoid the need to install and setup a programming environment by the students, a web-based environment like the open source JupyterLab can be used. This paper presents Juxl, an extension of this online programming environment, allowing a modular, performant and secure way of logging user interactions and learning experiences. The logs are generated as xAPI statements and stored in a Learning Record Store to be further analyzed.",

The Semiotic Inspection Method, from Semiotics Engineering, provides an analysis of the communicability of interactive systems. Results show EE4A is focused to nontechnical users while TAW-CMS targets more technical and accessibility profiles. As a final thought, it is proposed that Web 2.0 development environments should require appropriate assessment tools for non-technical people.",

        "Abstract": "A novel modular multiplatform software tool was developed for display, registration and fusion of cardiac electrophysiology (EP) voltage data with PET/SPECT cardiac images and their polar maps. The EP voltage measurements were acquired at discrete locations on the endocardial surface by a catheter-based electroanatomic mapping system as part of left ventricular tachycardia ablation procedures. These data were output as a list of voltages and 3-D mapping system coordinates. PET/SPECT data were 3-D short axis perfusion or viability images and derived polar maps. CardioViewer allows GUI menu-driven data input and display of EP and PET/SPECT data as well as their fusion in orthogonal slice, point cloud and polar map views. The software development environment was C++ using Qt Creator IDE, Open GL, ITK, freeglut and dicomlib. The modular program architecture facilitated addition of new functionalities and CardioViewer has been successfully run on Linux, Windows and Apple operating systems. Initial registration of EP and PET/SPECT datasets was achieved with user-input control points, after which the six degrees of freedom registration parameters could be interactively adjusted. EP voltage and PET/SPECT values can be output at matched polar map locations, which avoids regional averaging of tissue properties. CardioViewer is being used to investigate local prediction of EP tissue categories from PET/SPECT images. An example ROC analysis using Tl-201 SPECT data is provided.",

        "Abstract": "Code smells have long been catalogued with corresponding mitigating solutions called refactoring operations. However, despite the successful initiatives of integrating many of the latter in current IDEs (e.g., Eclipse), code smells detection has not gained the same status. Researchers have pointed out that the code smells detection process is inherently subjective and this fact is probably the main hindrance on providing automatic support. This research work focuses on the code smells detection process. To this end, it aims at proposing two contributions that, when used in a combined fashion, are expected to mitigate the aforementioned problem: crowdsmellling and smelly maps. We envisage that such features will be available in a future generation of interactive development environments (aka IDE 2.0) to help software developers to identify a set of code smells in Java source code. Crowdsmelling uses the concept of collective intelligence through which users around the world are encouraged to collaborate to a knowledge base that runs on a cloud server. This process will improve the assessment of the detection accuracy using a calibration process that occurs on the server after receiving data and suggestions from each user. Through the process of code smells detection based and referenced to a knowledge base (one for each code smell), we expect to some extent mitigate the subjectivity problem. Smelly maps builds upon the previous experience of setting up a software visualization infrastructure. It involves a strategy to represent detected code smells at different abstraction levels with the goal to increase software quality awareness. We expect to integrate both proposals with the aforementioned visualization infrastructure developed as an Eclipse plugin to facilitate refactoring decisions upon large software systems. We have laid out several evidence-based validation experiments, which will hopefully demonstrate that a step forward in the code smelling process will be achieved.",

        "Abstract": "Nowadays, the Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) surveillance system is being utilized in order to keep peace and provide security to people. There are several defects in the video surveillance system, such as: picture is indistinct, anomalies cannot be identified automatically, a lot of storage spaces are needed to save the surveillance information, and prices remain relatively high. This paper describes the design and implementation of a low-cost system monitoring based on Raspberry Pi, a single board computer which follows Motion Detection algorithm written in Python as a default programming environment. In addition, the system uses the motion detection algorithm to significantly decrease storage usage and save investment costs. The algorithm for motion detection is being implemented on Raspberry Pi, which enables live streaming camera along with detection of motion. The live video camera can be viewed from any web browser, even from mobile in real-time.",

        "Abstract": "Cloud Computing is changing the services consumption and delivery platform as well as the way businesses and users interact with IT resources. It represents a major conceptual shift that introduces new elements in programming models and development environments that are not present in traditional technologies. The evolution of Cloud Computing motivates teaching Cloud Computing to computer science senior students and graduate students so that they can gain broad exposure to the main body of knowledge of Cloud Computing and get prepared for occupations in industry. There is thus a strong need for having a Cloud Computing education course that (i) has a broad coverage of different roles interacting with a cloud; and (ii) leverages Cloud Computing concepts, technology and architecture topics at both introductory and advanced level. In this paper, we describe the demand for understanding the impact of Cloud Computing in computer science higher education. We propose education strategies for teaching Cloud Computing, including key knowledge areas for an enduring Cloud Computing course.",

        "Abstract": "Distance education has gained significance recently. However, its application to robotics education presents challenges as physical access to hardware is typically required. While educational robotics simulation platforms exist, most are limited in scope or do not facilitate remote collaboration well. This paper proposes a novel networked robotics simulator for education, where students are able to collaborate in a shared 3D virtual space their robots inhabit. The framework combines these simulated worlds with a block-based programming environment to enable distance robotics education for a wider audience. The users' programs run in a web browser on their computers and they issue commands to the virtual robots through a network protocol abstracted to simple-to-use blocks. Robots send back acknowledgements and sensor values through the same protocol. Interactive environments provide students with a more immersive educational experience, and allow for automatically evaluating student performance. In addition to sharing the virtual worlds remotely, students can also develop their programs together since the block-based environment supports both synchronous and asynchronous remote collaboration. The paper presents two scenarios showing a robotics challenge and an extension of the concept to a smart city scenario controlling traffic lights. Reduced barriers to entry for both robotics education and curriculum creation will allow for a more diverse set of students and course materials.",

        "Abstract": "Software developers spend about a quarter of their workday using the web to fulfill various information needs. Searching for relevant information online can be time-consuming, yet acquired information is rarely systematically persisted for later reference. In this work, we introduce SALI, an approach for semi-automated inline linking of web pages to source code locations. SALI helps developers naturally capture high-quality, explicit links between web pages and specific source code lo-cations by recommending links for curation within the IDE. Through two laboratory studies, we examined the developer's ability to both curate and consume links between web pages and specific source code locations while performing software development tasks. The studies were performed with 20 subjects working on realistic software change tasks from widely-used open-source projects. Results show that developers continuously and concisely curate web pages at meaningful locations in the code with little effort. Additionally, we found that other developers could use these curations while performing new and different change tasks to speed up relevant information gathering within unfamiliar codebases by a factor of 2.4.",

        "Abstract": "In traditional software, engineering tools, software configuration management (SCM) is the dominant approach to manage the evolution of a software system. However, the evolution of Web-based applications presents special challenges that have not been well addressed by existing SCM systems. They often treat hyperlinked Web documents as a set of text files in a file .system and disregard crucial structures in a Web-based application such as internal structure, navigational structure, logical structure, and compositional structure among Web objects. Key limitations include their inadequacy to represent Web object semantics and their inability to manage changes to those important structures among objects making up a Web application. This paper presents a novel SCM-centered development environment for Web-based applications, named WebSCM. With WebSCM, Web developers can manage fine-grained, structural evolution of Web objects and important structures among them at different levels of abstraction (e.g. conceptual, navigational, presentation, and implementation levels). This paper also describes the motivation for this environment as well as its user interfaces, features, and implementation.",

With the aim of identifying an OSS test process, three well-known OSS projects, namely Apache HTTP server, Mozilla Web browser, and NetBeans IDE were studied. In these studies, three activities were found similar to the activities of the ISO/IEC Test Process Standard. However, major differences were observed in tasks related to each of the test process activities. To systematize the OSS test process, an Open Source Software Test Process Framework (OSS-TPF) is proposed. The alignment of OSS-TPF with the ISO/IEC Test Process Standard is illustrated.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we are interested in solutions to improve remote practical work in the field of computing, more specifically in programming, networks and telecommunications. In the literature, practical work solutions, based on the cloud or on synchronous / asynchronous monitoring and collaboration tools or on shared writing spaces, are proposed to enable practical work to be carried out remotely. However, the cloud based solution, which uses virtual machines, consumes a lot of resources, and therefore brings cumbersome. Each virtual machine contains an image of the operating system, libraries, and applications and can therefore grow very large. The solution based on collaboration tools does not integrate IT development environments, and therefore the programmer resorts to screen shares or basic editors which waste a lot of time when it comes to find certain modules, classes or native functions of the language.In this paper, we propose to replace virtual machines with containers to optimize resources, and provide a collaborative and easy-to-access lab interface. Each user connects to their own workspace provided by the container, which is accessible by the teacher and other learners in the same group. The practical work will be carried out from a web interface connected to the virtual environment via an API. Real-time communication between learners and teachers will be ensured by WebRTC technology.",

        "Abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has spread its wings in many sectors, such as autonomous driving, healthcare, agriculture, industry, home automation, the environment, smart grids, retail, and logistics. Building the IoT prototype requires knowledge of different disciplines, namely sensors, database programming, protocols, embedded systems programming, and mobile application development. The block-based programming removes all these dependencies and enables the student to build an IoT prototype. The block-based programming tools are available online as open source, which comes to aid in rapid IoT prototype development at ease.In this paper, we present the development of an IoT prototype with the use case of smart agriculture using a block-based programming platform available online. The functionalities provided to the agricultural robot (agribot) are ploughing, sowing, saving the data in the cloud database, and monitoring the temperature and humidity of the farming land.The results are promising; the developer can rapidly deploy the IoT prototype in different domains such as transportation, energy, cities, and industry.",

It is becoming the next paradigm to deploy business services on the Web. Developing WS is a new challenge due to the complexity of various business processes and different communication protocols. In this paper, we propose a methodology to efficiently develop Web Services by wrapping software agents. This agent oriented method uses software agents as building blocks of WS, and exploits the commonly available agent development tools to accelerate the whole development cycle. Software agents in this methodology not only implement the business processes, but also enrich the functions of WS. Our approach provides a solution for Web Service engineering. A case study in holiday booking service is presented to show the benefits and advantages of this agent oriented service engineering methodology.",

Among these challenges are the small display sixes, the low bandwidth, input limitations and the mobility of these devices. Web service providers need to be aware of these limitations in order to meet the exact needs of mobile clients. In this paper, we claim that new methodologies and development tools are needed in order to support the development and management of multi-device-enabled Web services. We discuss challenges and open problems faced by Web developers in adapting services to support mobile access.

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we review the design, development and evaluation of our initial desktop CAI/CAS modules in two stages before presenting our experience in developing and evaluating these materials in a web-based format. In the initial stage of desktop CAI development, we obtained valuable insight into ways to improve the animated simulations through informal student feedback and ongoing formative evaluation. We note that presentation time in both lecture and lab are significantly reduced by applying these modules. The second stage of desktop CAI evaluation began after most of the suggestions from the initial stage had been incorporated. The evaluation of the desktop CAI in the second stage consists of a more direct measurement comparing pre-test and post-test scores for students conducting lab exercises in either the traditional hands-on assignment or in the CAI/CAS format. This study also shows no statistical difference between the two groups of students. However, this review demonstrates the importance of student feedback in both formative and summative evaluations and several key benefits of the CAI/CAS format. Lastly, this paper presents our development strategy for enhancing these materials and for converting them into a web-based format. Due to our disappointing experience with commercial web-authoring software, our strategy changed to a \"from scratch\" approach using inexpensive and easy to use web-based development tools. Cost for these tools, development time estimates and results of an informal evaluation of our first two web-based modules are also reported.",

On one side, composition of web services is a process that facilitates inter-enterprise applications in order to fulfill the requirements. On the other side, UML has been widely used in software development. Therefore, some UML modeling diagrams for web services composition processes have the advantage that software developers are acquainted with the notation. However, tools that implement UML diagrams must evolve in order to support web services composition. A tool that models UML activity diagrams for web services composition with its parser built as a web is described in this paper. The idea of the paper is to propose software development tools seen as polymorphic entities.",

        "Abstract": "Regular expressions are frequently found in programming projects. Studies have found that developers can accurately determine whether a string matches a regular expression. However, we still do not know the challenges associated with composing regular expressions. We conduct an exploratory case study to reveal the tools and strategies developers use during regular expression composition. In this study, 29 students are tasked with composing regular expressions that pass unit tests illustrating the intended behavior. The tasks are in Java and the Eclipse IDE was set up with JUnit tests. Participants had one hour to work and could use any Eclipse tools, web search, or web-based tools they desired. Screen-capture software recorded all interactions with browsers and the IDE. We analyzed the videos quantitatively by transcribing logs and extracting personas. Our results show that participants were 30% successful (28 of 94 attempts) at achieving a 100% pass rate on the unit tests. When participants used tools frequently, as in the case of the novice tester and the knowledgeable tester personas, or when they guess at a solution prior to searching, they are more likely to pass all the unit tests. We also found that compile errors often arise when participants searched for a result and copy/pasted the regular expression from another language into their Java files. These results point to future research into making regular expression composition easier for programmers, such as integrating visualization into the IDE to reduce context switching or providing language migration support when reusing regular expressions written in another language to reduce compile errors.",

PaaS provides a platform similar to a software development environment over a network. On most PaaS systems, applications that are developed on a server, are executed on the same server. As such, portability of these applications is not considered. This paper proposes a Server-side Development and Client-side Execution (SDCE) Environment for developing GUI applications.

        "Abstract": "The task of locating the parts of the code that are relevant to a feature in object-oriented systems is widely recognized as a non-trivial task and a body of reverse engineering research collectively referred to as feature identification has emerged. The main focus of feature identification research to date is in a reverse engineering context. Despite the fact that research has highlighted the usefulness of feature identification techniques for program comprehension, very little of this effort has found its way into the software engineer's development environment. In this paper, we demonstrate a tool providing a perspective of a system that reflects how features are implemented to support maintenance activities. By integrating this tool in a development environment we support feature understanding while performing maintenance activities. This environment, called feature-centric environment, compares several features visually, provides a detailed view for a single feature and integrates a code browser focusing on a single feature of a software system. All these different views are enriched with metrics, they are interconnected and the user is able to interact with them. We introduce the feature-centric environment and its different views.",

        "Abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept that considers the pervasive presence of things or objects/equipment that communicate through wireless, cable connections and can interact with each other and can collaborate with other things or objects, to create new services and medical applications in order to achieve common objectives (diagnosis, treatment, patient rehabilitation). Considering that the Android operating system allows data storage, connectivity, Web browser, media support, development environment, we propose to develop an application that will come in support to any patient who is suffering from hypotension/hypertension, diabetes, obesity, or other metabolic diseases associated, and even more for patients with vision impairments who are unable to be independent. With the help of such application the patients and physicians can monitor measured values of blood pressure, values of blood glucose, weight, body mass index, cholesterol, etc., having the possibility of creating a database and a medical history, in which the values specified by the medical devices are stored on the smartphone using Bluetooth™ technique. In this paper we developed an application on the Android platform which aims at recording data measured (SBP - Systolic Blood Pressure, DBP - Diastolic Blood Pressure and Heart Rate) by the electronic sphygmomanometer which communicates using Bluetooth™ technique. The application offers the possibility of transmitting medical data via mobile Internet or wireless. Data will be compared with standard values and if these values are not in the normal range, the patient is alerted, including family doctor, or in the worst case the emergency service.",

MICE is to be used as the basis for the study of the visual design process applied to the development of TAO-based multimedia applications. The unifying model used in this approach is barred on Teleaction Objects (TAOs). TAOs are multimedia objects with attached knowledge structured as an active index. TAOs can be described using the TAOML extension of HTML. This allows for easy prototyping of distributed multimedia applications using a web browser as the user interface. The TAOML Builder tool allows the user to visually specify a TAO. The hypergraph is parsed for correctness using an underlying Boundary Symbol Relation grammar and the correct TAOML is output. TAOML can be translated into standard HTML using the TAOML Interpretor. The ICs for the application can be visually specified using the IC Builder. The IC Compiler produces the IC Manager which provides the run-time environment for the ICs.",

        "Abstract": "The efficient development of parallel applications is challenging despite the availability of various tools and libraries that help specify communication and synchronization among other tasks. In order to hide the complexity of this type of programming, we propose a Graphical Development Environment for the construction of Parallel MPI Applications (GD-MPI). GD-MPI allows the implementation of workflows using a GUI, each workflow represents a set of Java-MPI processes where group creation, point-to-point and collective communications are graphically expressed by developers. In GD-MPI, the basic broadcasting, scattering, and gathering of MPI collective communications is provided. This environment can be extended to include other MPI Standard communications. GD-MPI runs in a web browser and allows users to execute their applications on remote clusters. In this paper we present the GD-MPI environment and its workflow language, which is expressed through a context-free graph grammar that is based on Hyperedge Replacement Grammars (HRG). We also give a comparison of GD-MPI to other graphical platforms for developing parallel applications on MPI. Some examples that illustrate the use of our environment are shown.",

        "Abstract": "HTML5 game development is an upcoming trend that enables new technologies to interact in order to produce high quality games entirely based on the web. However, a fully functional web game requires layer upon layer of code to produce each particular game feature. This is because there are many development tools, but no specific solutions. The game developer ends up writing everything from the raw backend server to persist the game state to the end-user game features. Furthermore, the game developer needs to come up with several custom implementations to consume different providers to do things like user player login, game storage, social interaction, analytics, etc. This paper aims to present a practical solution that covers the gap between raw cloud services (the tool) and the high level functionality (the real-life game features) a game needs to be successfully built in less time (and at a lower cost) than the current solutions take.",

So, to overcome the limitation of the existing web like this, researches for Semantic web ontology languages (RDF, RDFS, OWL and so on) prescribed as standard of W3C and for the related technologies have conducted actively. Also, recently the interest for Jena2, Java framework, including rule-based inference engine and the programming environment for the languages like RDF, FDFS, OWL, SPARQL and so on has been heightened. Jena2 has problems that the performance for simple selection operation and the performance for the query that join operations are required slow down, and the performance in processing OWL data slows down because storing document information in a single table. This paper designed and realized OWL Translator to move to the relational database designing in this paper the data being in Multiple Translator and Jena Relational Database for storing each data information in a separate table after dividing the meaning of OWL documents into Class, Property, Individual to solve this problem. Also, this paper compared the processing performances of the engine quality realizing by using Multiple Translator and OWL Translator and the engine realizing by applying as it is the functions providing in Jena2 by using University Ontology providing in SPARQL engine of Jena2.",

        "Abstract": "This project focuses on higher education and industry training within the area of computer programming, specifically live instructor-led lab sessions. These sessions are currently run using a combination of different tools available on the market, such as video conferencing software, IDEs, screen sharing and file sharing. However, it’s this reliance on several tools which is resulting in productivity loss due to context switching. The solution explored through this project is a web application to facilitate synchronous remote coding lab sessions. It achieves this by combining a code editor, live communication, code sharing, displayed instructions, and help requests all into one web-based tool. This custom application will support educators by streamlining the running of these virtual sessions. It also aims to help improve learner engagement and motivation, by enabling the required 1:1 support and communication between educator and learner.",

The developed system is a client/server configuration where Web browsers were used as a generic client environment serving interface linking the client's parameter input to the search system located on the server side through the common gateway interface. The searching mechanism, developed in Turbo C programming environment and theory based on genetic algorithm, can find several desired solutions of the weaving parameters for the production of woven fabrics under controlled cost through access to the Web side. Moreover, the search mechanism was implemented by integrating the Internet information server 3.0 (IIS 3.0) Web server and a user interface was developed and underlying 2000 server platform. Through the assistance of this Web-based system the weaving mill can integrate the resource of different divisions (e.g. design division, production division and financial division) located at various areas on the earth to fulfill a perfect design of woven fabrics and enhance the enterprise's global competition power.",

They can then share their creations by adding them to web pages. Cocoa is distributed from a World Wide Web site, and that site serves as a community center for Cocoa users. Cocoa was designed over several years, involving users from the very start. The experience of designing an intevace that was powerful enough to enable users to create interesting programs, yet simple enough for children, has brought out some interesting examples of inteqace principles, as well as practical considerations that run counter to established principles. The intevace that resulted from this design process combines graphical rules with programming by demonstration. This system has led to notable classroom success in engaging children in the programming process, and in empowering them to create their own interactive worlds and simulations. It is considerably more challenging to motivate, encourage, and teach children who download the program from a web site. The Cocoa site offers a variety of methods for children to communicate with each other, and to learn how to use Cocoa. The author will discuss his experiences in designing Cocoa and supporting the distributed community of Cocoa users.",

        "Abstract": "The voluminous amount of information available in the Web makes information retrieval a challenging task. Most of the surfers' time is wasted in following different links ranked by search engines. Moreover, manual integration of information available in different Web pages is difficult and inefficient. So, to ease the process of information retrieval and to provide the surfer with more relevant information, Semantic Web could be employed. The metadata information available in the Semantic Web in the form of ontology helps in the retrieval of relevant information. In this paper, an Ontology-Based framework for Semantic Web Content Mining has been proposed. This framework is a semi-automatic process which suits many application domain like Education, Medicine and Tourism. The proposed framework is implemented in JAVA and ontology engineering is done using the ontology language, RDF (Resource Description Framework). The screen shots are designed using Net Beans IDE. The efficiency of the framework is measured in terms of precision, average precision and relevance score.",

        "Abstract": "A wavelet fuzzy neural network using asymmetric membership function (WFNN-AMF) with improved differential evolution (IDE) algorithm is proposed in this study to control a six-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) for an electric power steering (EPS) system. First, the dynamics of a steer-by-wire EPS system and a six-phase PMSM drive system are described in detail. Moreover, the WFNN-AMF controller, which combines the advantages of wavelet decomposition, fuzzy logic system, and asymmetric membership function (AMF), is developed to achieve the required control performance of the EPS system for the improvement of stability of the vehicle and the comfort of the driver. Furthermore, the online learning algorithm of WFNN-AMF is derived using back-propagation method. However, degenerated or diverged responses will be resulted due to the inappropriate selection of small or large learning rates of the WFNN-AMF. Therefore, an IDE algorithm is proposed to online adapt the learning rates of WFNN-AMF. In addition, a 32-bit floating-point digital signal processor, TMS320F28335, is adopted for the implementation of the proposed intelligent controlled EPS system. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed WFNN-AMF controller with IDE for the EPS system is verified through experimental results.",

        "Abstract": "Traditionally software development tools, such as compilers, linkers and build engines, were designed for use by individual engineers on dedicated desktop machines. As these tools evolved, they scaled-up by exploiting more powerful development machines. The same tools were adapted for team development to run on small, project-specific clusters by dedicating a server to process a single job at a time. While this paradigm has served us well in the past, it fails to take advantage of the positive network effects of cloud-based computing. During the past year, our team constructed a cloud based build system that enables fast and efficient builds through techniques that leverage parallel, cached, incremental, distributed, and multitenant builds. Leveraging the cloud's compute elasticity and storage capacity enabled us to reduce builds latency dramatically, building today in seconds and minutes instead of hours. But migrating existing tools to the cloud is daunting. This paper summarizes our findings in the form of six principles, on how we need to evolve engineering tools, starting with those that participate in the build automation, to simplify, take control, and move these tools to the cloud.",

The project was to build and deliver a Java software engineering development environment The students were organized into teams that had specific assignments to deliver portions of the product. The students established a Web page to track their progress and kept metrics on all of their effort. They defined and followed a software development life cycle. This was the first time these students had worked on a real deliverable product. The results of the semester long class was a bootable system running under Linux that is a complete Java software engineering development environment. It is being used today to drive a Web server and a shared development environment for a consulting organization and their clients. The final delivered cost, including the cost of the CDROM was less than $10.00. This team oriented, product focused class was successful in having the students demonstrate to themselves the value of software engineering disciplines and practices.",

        "Abstract": "Cyberlearning is challenged by the lack of personal and assessment-driven learning, and students are often puzzled by the lack of instructor guidance and feedback; the huge volume and diversity of the learning materials; and the lack of the ability to zoom in from the general concepts to the more specific ones, or the opposite. Knowledge-driven tutoring systems are needed to improve the cyberlearning quality. One of the major difficulties is knowledge representation. The current industry standard uses Web Ontology Language (OWL) for representing knowledge structure as ontologies. But ontology only supports one “first-class” relation, “is-a”, between the concepts, and different knowledge areas usually need different custom relations to describe the relations among the concepts. For example, “part-of” and time dependency are important relations to represent most engineering knowledge bodies. OWL can only use object properties to emulate such custom relations, leading to awkward knowledge representation hard for instructors to code, validate and use domain knowledge.This research contributes an open-source knowledge-driven online tutoring system framework that is easy to be adapted for the teaching of any subject based on open-source learning objects. Pace University's extension to OWL that supports Knowledge Graph (KG), a generalization of ontology, is used to support knowledge representation with custom relations. The instructors can use Pace University extended Protégé IDE to visually declare custom relations and encode domain knowledge of a course in a single document. The instructor teaching experience is also coded in the KG to better support custom learning order by students with different backgrounds. Integrated assessment after each learning object leads to optimized and adaptive learning order and learning resource recommendation. Students can freely navigate the knowledge space from general to specific or the opposite, or follow unique custom relations. A web technology tutorial is used to validate the design and effectiveness of this tutoring system framework.",

In this paper, we study opportunistic code reuse from the Web, e.g. when developers copy code snippets from popular Q&A sites and paste them into their projects. Our focus is the behavior of developers following opportunistic code reuse, which reveals the success or failure of the action. We study developer behavior via a large, representative dataset of micro-interactions in the IDE. Our analysis of developer behavior exhibited in this dataset confirms laboratory study observations that code reuse from the Web is followed by heavy editing, in some cases by a rapid undo, and rarely by the execution of tests.",

        "Abstract": "Learners interested in acquiring fundamental programming skills may choose from a variety of different offers, including Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Usually, these courses not only include lecture videos and multiple-choice quizzes, but also feature hands-on programming exercises, allowing learners to apply their newly acquired knowledge right away. Since solving these exercises requires access to a programming tool chain, most MOOCs embed their exercises in a web-based environment supplying necessary tools. One of these so-called auto-graders is CodeOcean, which allows learners to write and run code or receive automated feedback. While a web-based auto-grader lowers the entry barrier for learners to get started, providing sufficient resources for all code executions poses an additional challenge for the MOOC provider, especially during high-demand periods. Therefore, we evaluated serverless functions as offered by cloud computing providers for the use in auto-graders and conducted a Randomized Control Trial. Although serverless functions at first appear to be slower compared to our existing containerized execution of learners' code, they convinced with more constant execution times in high-demand periods.",

C language programming is a professional basic course, which focuses on cultivating students' programming ability and algorithm analysis ability, and lays a solid foundation for the subsequent courses. The blended \"golden course\" teaching mode integrates the advantages of online and offline teaching. The design of blended teaching mode consists of four parts: curriculum analysis, curriculum design, curriculum implementation and curriculum evaluation. The online platform provides MOOCS videos, online tests, development materials, etc. it can also release assignments, in class exercises, rush answers, group tasks, etc. through the platform and app, which can not only make students more flexible to master their own learning time, but also make students more actively participate in the course learning. Teachers can urge students to study by themselves, and the feedback homework can generate dynamic charts to help teachers understand students' learning effect more intuitively. After a semester of mixed teaching experience, we can make better use of online teaching platform, develop strengths and avoid weaknesses, make online and offline complement each other, and improve the quality of teaching and learning.",

Traditional compile-time error checking, such as calling a non-existent method in Java, are not available for checking whether such requests comply with the requirements of a web API. In this paper, we propose an approach to statically check web API requests in JavaScript. Our approach first extracts a request's URL string, HTTP method, and the corresponding request data using an inter-procedural string analysis, and then checks whether the request conforms to given web API specifications. We evaluated our approach by checking whether web API requests in JavaScript files mined from GitHub are consistent or inconsistent with publicly available API specifications. From the 6575 requests in scope, our approach determined whether the request's URL and HTTP method was consistent or inconsistent with web API specifications with a precision of 96.0%. Our approach also correctly determined whether extracted request data was consistent or inconsistent with the data requirements with a precision of 87.9% for payload data and 99.9% for query data. In a systematic analysis of the inconsistent cases, we found that many of them were due to errors in the client code. The here proposed checker can be integrated with code editors or with continuous integration tools to warn programmers about code containing potentially erroneous requests.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, our e-commerce industry has gained great support from national and local government. So our e-commerce industry's development prospects will be broader. Under the e-commerce environment, the competition towards online sellers has become more and more diverse and dynamic than the traditional competition game model. The rapid development of e-commerce makes more and more companies begin to get involved in this area, the market competition has become much fiercer. The vast majority of sellers on e-commerce platform can be viewed as a small business organization, and those businesses who sell similar products is single point of competition and multi-point competition. The sales strategies and mutual games towards the sellers also become increasingly fierce. At present, the game theory are basically involved in the one-dimensional game, few scholars have presented and applied multidimensional game in products pricing strategy; and few scholars have studied a little about one-dimensional game under the e-commerce environment, which mainly focused on the supply and demand sides 'complete information game. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce multidimensional game to study the game towards multi-sellers under the e-commerce environment, and find the game mechanism towards online sellers, so as to provide references for the optimization of e-commerce environment. On the basis of the analysis of the e-commerce industry's development environment, we make a summary analysis of the competition and game studies which related to the online sellers. At the same time, we analyze the online sellers' strategy studies of opening online shops and marketing from home and abroad. Faced with the complex and variable market's demands, the games towards online sellers have become more flexible. From the multidimensional game theory, we set the game strategic conditions of online sellers who sell homogeneous products. In view of the e-commerce environment, how do those online sellers choose the advertising inputs, related transaction service inputs and commodities pricing strategies in order to maximize their profits, we establish a multi-seller's multidimensional game model under the e-commerce environment and solve the equilibrium condition. Then we make a primary analysis of the equilibrium results and find the existence of online sellers' optimal game strategy equilibrium under the e-commerce environment. This research has certain guidance significance for the optimization of the sellers' game and their competition behaviors under the e-commerce environment.",

        "Abstract": "A smart space enhances a networked computing environment by enabling information sharing for a multitude of local digital devices and global resources from the Internet. We consider the M3 architecture (multi-device, multi-vendor, multi-domain) for creating smart spaces, which integrates technologies from two innovative concepts: the Semantic Web and the Internet of Things. Our research focus is on analyses of the capabilities of Smart-M3 platform, which provides software implementations for such a central element of an M3 smart space as Semantic Information Broker (SIB). The paper presents a state-of-the-art and contributes our systematized vision on the SIB design and implementation. The analyzed open source SIB implementations include the original Smart-M3 piglet-based SIB, its optimized descendant RedSIB, OSGi SIB for Java devices, pySIB for Python devices, and CuteSIB for Qt devices. We also analyze the design of proprietary or incomplete SIB implementations: RIBS for embedded devices and ADK SIB built upon the OSGi framework with integration in the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment. The theoretical study is augmented with experimental evaluation of available SIB implementations.",

        "Abstract": "Informal language and the absence of a standard taxonomy for software technologies make it difficult to reliably analyze technology trends on discussion forums and other on-line venues. We propose an automated approach called Witt for the categorization of software technologies (an expanded version of the hypernym discovery problem). Witt takes as input a phrase describing a software technology or concept and returns a general category that describes it (e.g., integrated development environment), along with attributes that further qualify it (commercial, php, etc.). By extension, the approach enables the dynamic creation of lists of all technologies of a given type (e.g., web application frameworks). Our approach relies on Stack Overflow and Wikipedia, and involves numerous original domain adaptations and a new solution to the problem of normalizing automatically-detected hypernyms. We compared Witt with six independent taxonomy tools and found that, when applied to software terms, Witt demonstrated better coverage than all evaluated alternative solutions, without a corresponding degradation in false positive rate.",

IOPT nets are a Petri net class specifically designed to support the implementation of embedded system controllers. The IOPT-Tools Web service (http://gres.uninova.pt) includes an interactive graphical editor to design IOPT models, a model-checking framework consisting of a state-space generator and a query system, and automatic code generation tools to produce software (C) or hardware (VHDL) controller implementations. The Brushless DC Motor speed controller was decomposed into several subsystems, including a noise-filter, quadrature-decoder, PWM generator and an BLDC commutation-manager. These sub-systems were modeled using simple IOPT models, analyzed using the model-checking tools, resulting in the automatic creation of VHDL modules for each sub-system. To finish the entire project, a top VHDL module is used to instantiate copies of the automatically generated components and specify signals to connect the components to the external world. With the addition of an inverter board, a working prototype was implemented and successfully tested.",

        "Abstract": "Background: EEG-driven research is paramount in cognitive-neuropsychological studies, as it provides a non-invasive window to the underlying neural mechanisms of cognition and behavior. A myriad collection of software and hardware frameworks has been developed to alleviate some of the technical barriers involved in EEG-driven research. Methods: we propose an integrated development environment which encompasses the entire technical “data-collection pipeline” of cognitive-neuropsychological research, including experiment design, data acquisition, data exploration and analysis in a state-of-the-art user interface. Our framework is based on a unique integration between a python-based web framework, time-oriented databases and object-based data schemes. Results: we demonstrated our framework with the recording and analysis of an n-Back task completed by 15 elderly (ages 50 to 80) participants. This case study demonstrates the highly utilized nature of our integrated framework with a challenging target population. Furthermore, our results may provide new insights into the correlation between brain activity and working memory performance in elderly people, who are prone to experience accelerated decline in executive prefrontal cortex functioning. Conclusion: our framework extends the range of EEG-driven experimental methods for assessing cognition available for cognitive-neuroscientists, allowing them to concentrate on the creative part of their work instead of technical aspects.",

The course, M206, Computing: An Object-oriented Approach from the Open University (OU), will soon be introduced into the USA. While adhering to the original conception of LearningWorks that it promote a software engineering approach of systems building, we have successfully added support for the needs of the distance learning neophyte. By showing various microworlds and programming tools these notes outline the environment we have implemented and deployed.",

        "Abstract": "PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) is a business model in the cloud computing era, which provide a server platform or development environment for developers. Compared with the SaaS (Software-as-Service) to end-user, PaaS is more flexibility. Google App engine is a typical PaaS platform, which allows developers to write and run their own applications on the platform. It also helps developers store data and manage the server. However, it is not convenient for developers to write programs using java or Python API development. LongJump, which provide a platform for quickly building enterprise Web applications, significantly shorten the development cycle. But it does not have good scalability and mass data management capabilities, and can only provide service for some developers. This paper describes the techniques and frameworks used by the two platforms. And then we bring forward an improved framework for PaaS platform which combine with the advantages of GAE and LongJump platform by adopting Mashup technology. Using the improved framework, we can build the PaaS platform which is easier and more flexible for development of web applications.",

        "Abstract": "As we continue to expand our activities on and beneath the surface of our oceans, there is an ever-expanding requirement to monitor and collect oce?anographie and meteorological data in increasingly remote and harsh marine environments. Ocean Observing systems provide critical information; information in support of problem solving, decision making, prediction and forecasting as well as in support of offshore engineering and design activities. In short, these systems enable us to better understand the oceans around us. Ocean data are often expensive and logistically challenging to collect. It is crucial that maximum value is derived from the investment made in ocean observation. Collecting and delivering data in a cost effective and timely manner is essential to its viability and ultimately its value to the end user. Over the last two decades there has been an explosion in the use of GIS (Geographic Information Systems) in ocean observation across a wide range of sectors from aquaculture to defense and security. As acceptance and usage of GIS continues to grow in these disparate sectors, many applications have developed their own data standards and their own proprietary software for processing, analysis and presentation. The concept of Open GIS was conceived with the vision of creating a set of open interface standards to enable diverse geo-processing systems to share data and communicate directly and efficiently. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) was formed to develop these open interface specifications as well as to lead the education and outreach components of the initiative. In broadest terms, an ocean observing system is comprised of three primary functional layers. The \"top\" layer, from the point of view of the end user, is the application layer, the software tools that enable the user to process, interpret and act upon data. The second layer is the service layer, the hardware and software necessary to move, store and manage data. The third layer is the data collection layer consisting of the sensors and systems that are the physical interface with the ocean environment. The OGC promotes the concept of Sensor Web Enablement. A Sensor Web is a World Wide Web accessible network comprised of geographically distributed sensors and archived data. The sensors may monitor any physical parameter depending on the location and the application. The data, whether directly from sensors or from archived sources, can be located and accessed using standard communications protocols and programming tools. Fully implemented, OGC specifications will ultimately enable access to geospatial data regardless of source or location. It will enable data from different sources to be integrated and analyzed and will promote \"common look and feel\" visualization and display of information. There is considerable interest in the marine user community to define a new class of standards-based ocean sensors. These sensors can be located and identified over the World Wide Web, demonstrate \"plug and work\" interoperability in the field and offer data that can be shared, processed and presented to end users across many disciplines and applications. Ultimately these \"smart\" ocean sensors will result in new and increased market potential for sensor manufacturers as well as reduced costs to the end user. The Smart Ocean Sensors Consortium (SOSC) has been formed by a group of ocean sensor manufacturers and end users with the collective vision of improving the reliability, utility and cost-effectiveness of ocean observing sensor networks through the adoption, development, and promotion of appropriate standard interfaces and protocols. A primary SOSC objective is the submission of an interoperable ocean sensor specification for adoption by the Open Geospatial Consortium and ultimately dissemination to the wider oceans community.",

Based on the social trends, various web services for the education of programming which improves the computational thinking of a student. Among the web services, block-based programming languages are well known as an effective educational tool for a primary student though a freshman in the university. These tools are proven to be useful tools since the tools provide same programming environment to the students and the teachers anytime and anywhere. However, the environments may be insufficient for learning practical programming languages, such as C/C++ and Java, because they are not the block-based programming languages. This paper introduces a block-based learning environment for C programming language using web services. The environment fills the gap between building computational thinking and learning the syntax of the programming language. The programming environment provides the equivalent environment to teachers and the students during the programming hands-on.",

        "Abstract": "Our paper on “Mica” from the 2006 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing, VL/HCCO6 [1] presented a prototype tool that helped programmers use a description of desired functionality to find specific relevant API classes and methods. Mica worked by using the Google Web APIs to find pages relating to a given query, and then using a list of known API classes and methods to recognize and aggregate the API-relevant words contained in the result pages. Mica used weighted word frequencies to find the API-relevant words correlated with the search and displayed the most relevant words alongside regular web search results. We had observed that when programmers create new software or add functionality to existing software, a common and often difficult task is that of using libraries, toolkits and SDKs to achieve the desired functionality. Internet search engines, in particular Google, have emerged as new and effective tools for this task, providing quick access to a large collection of tutorials and example code. However, our observations of how programmers used these resources revealed problems and inefficiencies in their use as programming tools. Mica was the first of long series of tools that we built as part of the “Natural Programming Project” [2] to help programmers more easily use APIs. We speculate that the impact of the Mica paper is because: ·The problem of helping users find and use the right API from a growing number of available options has become increasingly relevant. ·The data that comes from other developers' experience, found and ranked through web search, continues to be an invaluable starting point for finding and figuring out how to use APIs. · The strategy of extracting and displaying relevant information alongside Google search results has proven effective. Since Mica came out Google and Bing have started to support this pattern for movies, people, events, and many other pieces of information, although not yet APIs. ·That sweet logo!",

In the modern life we live, the internet continues to provide every day new facilities that make life easier and more convenient for users. This paper focuses on one of the main issues related to bird's monitoring system in the province of Cotopaxi in Ecuador. This specific area has been overlooked; the information is disorganized, it can be found only manually and at the same time it can be lost. By taking these into account, we considered that is crucial to systematize records of birds' information through building in agile way a web application system. It will contribute to better organizing, classification, and management of information for all the interested parties. Therefore, this research represents the development of a web application system for birds' monitoring. Through the management of software processes, it aims to generate a scientific database that allows users to interact in real time. For a quick and agile development, was applied SCRUM methodology. In addition, PHP programming tools and MySql database construction were used to simplify the writing process of the web application. We believe that we have found a solution for birds' data management and an innovative mechanism that reduces time and efforts.",

        "Abstract": "Internet-of-Things (IoT) is no longer just a research hype, but rather a reality in which ICT plays a fundamental role. Programming the behavior of Smart Environments not only enables designers to create innovative interactive experiences for intelligent spaces, but also empowers their inhabitants to tailor the intelligent facilities according to their preferences. To that end, this paper presents the AmI-Solertis system that offers a complete suite of tools allowing management, programming, testing, and monitoring of all the individual artifacts (i.e., services, hardware modules, software components, etc.) of a Smart Environment, but also of the environment itself as a whole. In more details, it introduces a REST-based communication middleware that streamlines synchronous and asynchronous remote services usage. Moreover, it presents the AmI-Solertis web-IDE that aims to support users who wish to create, explore, deploy, and optimize behavior scripts that combine and orchestrate the various technological facilities of Smart Environments, by offering universal and personalized exploration facilities to accelerate their discovery and a web-based code editor with context-sensitive support features.",

        "Abstract": "In this study, a dialogue tree-based Turkish chatbot has been developed and integreted into the Pynar Python code editor in order to help the users with the questions they may ask while learning the python language. The Pynar Python Code editor is developed as a TÜBİTAK supported open source project. The architecture we propose has been developed in such a way that it can respond to users' questions and give emotional feedback through dialogs and emojis. It also runs completely offline, without being connected to any internet site or web service. The chatbot is coded using Python language and a Turkish NLP library and Qt GUI library. Considering the age and education levels of the target user group of the Pynar editor, our chatbot will provide great convenience to those who are trying to learn Python programming on their own, with the possibility of asking questions and getting answers in their native language.",

        "Abstract": "The Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) paradigm has gained a lot of attention in the software industry since represents a novel way of architecting distributed applications. SOC is mostly materialized via Web Services, which allows developers to structure applications as building blocks exposing a clear, public interface to their capabilities. Although conceptually and technologically mature, SOC still lacks adequate development support from a methodological point of view. We present the Easy SOC project, a catalog of guidelines to build service-oriented applications and services. This catalog synthesizes best SOC development practices that arise as a result of several years of research in fundamental SOC-related topics, namely WSDL-based technical specification, Web Service discovery and Web Service outsourcing. In addition, we describe a plug-in for the Eclipse IDE that has been implemented to simplify the utilization of the guidelines. We believe that both the practical nature of the guidelines, the empirical evidence that supports them, and the availability of IDE support that enforces them will help software practitioners to rapidly exploit our ideas for building real SOC applications.",

The initial programming course in the College of Engineering and Information Systems was taught using Python with labs and assignments performed using the IDLE Integrated Development Environment. A new course was developed using Jupyter Notebooks focusing on introductory programming concepts and data analytics in the Internet of Things. In the new design, each student received an Arduino kit to run experiments for a course project while using Jupyter Notebooks to learn basic programming skills. The data gathered from the Arduino was analyzed with Python's data analytics modules. The combination of real world application in IoT and the ease of use with Jupyter Notebooks resulted in higher pass rates and student satisfaction.",

        "Abstract": "The project is centered on designing a roadside hybrid vertical axis wind turbine system capable of harvesting wind energy produced by the air drag of passing vehicles and the ambient wind, which would power the hybrid VAWT system and charge batteries. The study aimed to maximize the turbine’s efficiency by incorporating J-Type Darrieus VAWT and S-Type Savonius VAWT blades into a hybrid VAWT blade design. The prototype was tested on the North Luzon Expressway. Wind speed was measured using a handheld anemometer. No load voltage, full load voltage, current, output power, and temperature were measured using different measuring and sensing devices and were recorded in the datalogger and stored in a 32GB microSD memory card. The measured values were transmitted to the cloud with Arduino Integrated Development Environment and Visual Studio Code. The data are visualized on the Graphical User Interface of the dedicated server for monitoring and evaluating the performance of the hybrid VAWT. After testing the prototype from morning to evening on the NLEX, the hybrid VAWT could charge the battery from 62.63 to 70.53 percent capacity. The prototype testing revealed that a minimum wind speed of 2 m/s is required for the hybrid VAWT to begin rotating. The results were evaluated using graphs and curves.",

        "Abstract": "Web services have recently emerged as a powerful technology for integrating heterogeneous applications over the Internet. The widespread adoption of Web services promises to usher in an exciting new generation of advanced distributed applications. These will support a new and growing set of specifications, such as Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), Web Services Description Language (WSDL), and Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI). Extensible Markup Language (XML) and its associated family of standards also play a central role in Web services by providing a data interchange format that is independent of both programming languages and operating systems. The application developer seeking to reap the benefits of Web services is therefore faced with a significant, and potentially steep, new learning curve. Clearly, application development tools that lower this barrier are crucial for the rapid and widespread adoption of Web services. This paper discusses the development tasks associated with XML Web services and describes a new suite of tools that improve developer productivity, by reducing the requirements for detailed knowledge of the underlying specifications and standards, and allow the developer to focus on the business problem domain. This suite of XML and Web services tools is part of IBM's recently released WebSphere® Studio Application Developer product, which is based on the new Eclipse open source tool integration platform.",

These applications are often called Personalized Web Tasks. Thus, in addition to software developers, end-users are now participating in the service development through personal service configurations. End-user driven development poses new requirements on the development tools, which traditionally are targeted for software developers. We discuss the requirements for end-user driven integration of data-oriented web resources and use our own prototype tool as an example implementation. We describe generic data types for web services and propose a technique for adding metadata to service descriptions. The metadata is used to help the user to build service configurations and to convert data between different formats used by web services.",

        "Abstract": "Although Web services are generally envisioned as being stateless, some of them are implicitly stateful. The reason is that the Web services often work as front-ends to enterprise systems and are used in a session-oriented way by the clients. Contrary to the case of stateless services, for a stateful Web service there exist constraints to the order in which the operations of the service may be invoked. However, specification of such constraints is not a standard part of a Web service interface, and compliance with such constraints is not checked by the standard Web service development tools. Therefore, we propose in this paper to extend a web service interface by a constraint definition that is based on behavior protocols. Also, we implemented a tool that checks whether a given BPEL code complies with the constraints of all stateful web services it communicates with. The key idea behind the tool is to translate the BPEL code into Java and then to check the Java program using Java PathFinder with behavior protocol extension.",

We introduce a generic open-source adapter framework for facilitating the integration of model-based test generators with test execution tools. The framework is based on the popular keyword concept and is seen as especially applicable in online testing, which requires continuous message passing between the generator and SUT. The architecture is based on plug-ins, similar to the Eclipse integrated development environment, enabling easy extension. We also discuss experiences in using the adapter framework to integrate our test generator for S60 smartphone GUI testing with the ASTE tool from Nokia.",

        "Abstract": "Programming online judges (POJs) have been increasingly used in CS1 classes, as they allow students to practice and get quick feedback. For instructors, it is a useful tool for creating assignments and exams. However, selecting problems in POJs is time consuming. First, problems are generally not organized based on topics covered in the CS1 syllabus. Second, assessing whether problems require similar effort to be completed and map onto the same topic is a subjective and expert-dependent task. The difficulty increases if the instructor must create variations of these assessments, e.g., to avoid plagiarism. Thus, here, we research how to support CS1 instructors in the task of selecting problems, to compose one-size-fits-all or personalized assignments/exams. Our solution is to propose a novel intelligent recommender system, based on a fine-grained data-driven analysis of the students' effort on solving problems in the integrated development environment of a POJ system, and automatic detection of topics for CS1 problems, based on problem descriptions. Data collected from 2714 students are processed to support, via our artificial intelligence (AI) method recommendations, the instructors' decision-making process. We evaluated our method against the state of the art in a simple blind experiment with CS1 instructors ($N =$ 35). Results show that our recommendations are 88% accurate, surpassing our baseline ($p<$ 0.05). Finally, our work paves the way for novel POJ smart learning environments, wherein instructors define learning tasks (assignments/exams) supported by AI.",

        "Abstract": "The increase in scale provided by distributed computing systems has expanded scientific discovery and engineering solutions. Stochastic modeling with Performance Evaluation Process Algebra (PEPA) has been used to evaluate the robustness of static resource allocations in parallel and distributed computing systems. These evaluations have previously been performed through the PEPA Plug-In for the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment and have been limited by factors that include: i) the size and complexity of the underlying, in-use PEPA model, ii) a small number of resource allocation models available for analysis, and iii) the human interaction necessary to configure the PEPA Eclipse Plug-In, thus limiting potential automation. As the size and complexity of the underlying PEPA models increases, the number of states to be evaluated for each model also greatly increases, leading to a case of state space explosion. In this work, we validate the Imperial PEPA Compiler (IPC) as a replacement for the PEPA Eclipse Plug-In for the robustness analysis of resource allocations. We make available an implementation of the IPC as a Singularity container, as part of a larger online repository of PEPA resources. We then develop and test a programmatic method for generating PEPA models for resource allocations. When combined with our IPC container, this method allows automated analysis of resource allocation models at scale. The use of the IPC allows the evaluation of larger models than it is possible when using the PEPA Eclipse Plug-In. Moreover, the increases in scale in both model size and number of models, support the development of improved makespan targets for robustness metrics, including those among applications subject to perturbations at runtime, as found in typical parallel and distributed computing environments.",

        "Abstract": "Virtual Assessment is widely utilized in everyday life since it saves time and is the most accurate approach available, especially as the number of participants grows in today’s world. Students can take virtual tests that provide guidelines and tips to help them understand the material. Every technical student should have a fundamental understanding of the online examination system. Because of the rapid and precise grading system, all of the exams are held online. The flexibility of an online examination is greater than that of a written examination. It is primarily intended to encourage educational diversity. The integrity of the exam pattern is less likely to be compromised with online examination. For example, when compared to other examination systems, disposing of the online test setup is the most difficult. For the implementation in this exam platform technologies like Python GUI, Machine Learning, Image Processing, Firebase are used. Tkinter is used as python GUI toolkit(Frontend), Firebase as Backend application development, Spyder(Anaconda) is an IDE for python language, OpenCV for Image Processing and Haarcascade Classifier to detect the objects in the picture. The goal of this project is to provide the exam platform for students, so that the tests can be conducted in coordinated form without cheating and also to predict the accurate results of each student.",

        "Abstract": "Functional test programs are increasingly used as flexible approaches to verify device functionality, both online (e.g., Software-Based Self Tests encapsulated in Software Test Library) and during the manufacturing test flow (e.g., System-Level Test). However, a traditional integrated development environment seldom analyzes functional test program weaknesses regarding fault-masking and propagation in CPU registers. Therefore, understanding the presence of errors in the programs due to logic faults at the end of the test program is only assessed by a signature computation, e.g., xor operation between all registers. The presence of program weaknesses in terms of data or control flow is not assessed, and it may lead to fault escapes and/or masking. In particular, those are perfect conditions for proliferating Silent data corruption and unrecoverable errors at the system level.This work aims to introduce a guided debugger-based fault injector framework to verify the fault propagation and masking capabilities of functional test programs by eventually catching program errors without relying on time-consuming simulation-based approaches. The fault-free instruction trace is dumped and analyzed to provide information about possible target registers of specific instructions for injecting faults, e.g., in jump instructions, where errors into registers may change the execution flow or not, to verify the presence of silent data corruptions and errors.The experimental results are carried out on an automotive device from the SPC58 family manufactured by STMicroelectronics, and faults are injected through a script running on Power Debug E40 from Lauterbach.",

        "Abstract": "The development of semantic web technologies assures a new incentive for researches over software engineering. Although the basic concepts of semantic web have a widespread tradition over engineering sector, it moreover becomes difficult for software engineers to look into the diversity of ontology-provided approaches. A realistic scenario Zoo Management is taken based on which an ontology is generated to provide more semantic information. We illustrate how these techniques can be put into practice using the modern Semantic Web development tool Protege, and indicate future possibilities.",

There are many initiatives that aim to realize the semantic Web services to enable effective exploitation of semantic annotations, and two major of them are Web service modeling ontology (WSMO) and ontology Web language for services (OWL-S). Several tools have been developed to realize both the conceptual models i.e. Web services execution environment (WSMX) is the reference implementation for WSMO, on the other side OWL-S reference implementation exists in the form of loose collection of individual tools like OWL-S Editor, OWL-S matchmaker, OWL-S virtual machine, OWL-S IDE, WSDL20WL-S converter and OWL-S2UDDI converter etc. In this paper, we have conducted a comparison of both the reference implementations to identify similarities and differences between them and to evaluate their potential to become widely accepted implementation recommendations.",

        "Abstract": "Haskell is an advanced functional programming language. The product of more than 20 years of research, it enables rapid development of robust, concise, and fast software. Haskell supports integration with other languages and has loads of built-in concurrency, parallelism primitives, and rich libraries. With its state-of-the-art testing tools and an active community, Haskell makes it easier to produce flexible, maintainable, high-quality software. The most popular Haskell implementation is the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), a highperformance optimizing native-code compiler. Here, we look at Snap, a Web-development framework for Haskell. Snap combines many other Web-development environments' best features: writing Web code in an expressive highlevel language, a rapid development cycle, fast performance for native code, and easy deployment in production.",

        "Abstract": "Multi-cloud systems have been gaining popularity due to the several benefits of the multi-cloud infrastructure such as lower level of vendor lock-in and minimize the risk of widespread data loss or downtime. Thus, the multi-cloud infrastructure enhances the dependability of the cloud-based system. However, it also poses many challenges such as nonstandard and inherent complexity due to different technologies, interfaces, and services. Consequently, it is a challenging task to design multi-cloud dependable systems. Virtualization is the key technology employed in the development of cloud-based systems. Docker has recently introduced its container-based virtualization technology for the development of software systems. It has newly launched a distributed system development tool called Swarm, which allows the development of a cluster of multiple Swarm nodes on multiple clouds. Docker Swarm has also incorporated several dependability attributes to support the development of a multi-cloud dependable system. However, making Swarm cluster always available requires minimum three active manager nodes which can safeguard one failure. This essential condition for the dependability is one of the main limitations because if two manager nodes fail suddenly due to the failure of their hosts, then Swarm cluster cannot be made available for routine operations. Therefore, this paper proposes an intuitive approach based on Computational Intelligence (CI) for enhancing its dependability. The proposed CI-based approach predicts the possible failure of the host of a manager node by observing its abnormal behaviour. Thus, this indication can automatically trigger the process of creating a new manager node or promoting an existing node as a manager for enhancing the dependability of Docker Swarm.",

        "Abstract": "With the advent of cloud computing and the virtualisation of computer systems, challenges exist in managing resources and Virtual Machines (VMs) effectively. Cloud computing platform services offer scalable and resilient platforms, but are still not without complexity to the end user community; this paper proposes an alternative solution for the deployment of an intelligent private or public cloud compute platform, built around a set of predefined rule based parameters with the purpose of providing a simplified process for provisioning VMs. The proposed solution incorporates an architecture and design, utilising existing utilities, tools and protocols; it provides example output from the experiment conducted to prove the overall process and concept are feasible for implementation in terms of presenting a simplified deployment mechanism. By using an Intelligent Decision Engine (IDE), it enables strict adherence to a set of standard build parameters based around expert system administration knowledge, which uniquely supports a one-click VM deployment procedure. Subsequent control and management of the system environment and VMs then continue to be managed through use of the IDE and its expert knowledge base.",

It is a fundamental course that introduces the basic theories, concepts, techniques, and analytical methods related to microwave technology and antennas. This course has strong theoretical foundations, extensive applications, complex contents. At the same time, due to the high frequency of microwave devices and their generally high prices, using virtual simulation software for design and simulation will greatly improve efficiency and reduce costs. This article proposes a simulation and visualized virtual simulation of microwave antenna transmission parameters based on the XOJO network programming platform, including simulating antenna oscillators, simulating line antennas, and parameters calculating on transmission Line by Smith charts. Through programming, this platform can enhance students' interest in learning microwave antenna technology, reduce learning difficulties, and facilitate teachers' teaching. The cloud virtual simulation teaching platform of this paper adopts WEB development and virtual server technology, uses the XOJO cross-platform programming software development tool to write the program for the Smith chart, and realizes real-time display of the antenna radiation patterns.

        "Abstract": "With the increasing use of social networks, the public has been used to releasing and spreading information with the help of online media, which aggravates the regulation pressure of online public opinion. Online public opinion is increasing, which is exactly one of the most prominent characteristics of the social network era. Under such circumstances, it is necessary to think about how to deal with the rapid increase of public opinion data and how to strengthen the management of public security incidents. While strengthening the management of public opinion, we need to take into account the complexity and variability of the social development environment at home and abroad, grasp the sudden nature of online public opinion, and conscientiously monitor online public opinions and warn of risks. In this context, we analyzed the needs of the early warning system of network public opinion by using big data and then articulated its design framework based on deep learning. The system is used to effectively identify the risks of public opinion information during the germination period and prevent the adverse impact.",

        "Abstract": "E-commerce is a process of buying, selling, transferring or exchanging products or services via the Internet. It is expected that in the future, more and more business transactions will be carried out through e-commerce. The design of an e-commerce website plays a significant role in attracting potential customers to visit the site. It can also influence customer's decision to make purchase and to return to the site. Good e-commerce applications need to be developed by professional programmers and the cost is substantially high. With the advent of Web 2.0 technology, end-users are now able to create their own web content and applications such as blog, facebook and friendster. Some providers such as Google provide a mechanism for end-users to create web sites and host e-commerce applications. However, using these technologies, users can only select and customize the application according to provide templates. One of the main problems with this approach is that they do not support a flexible layout design. This implies that an end-user cannot change the layout of a selected template. This paper presents a flexible and easy to use block-based development environment for creating customized e-commerce applications. A block is a single layer software component that performs a single function. Concurrent project has developed blocks for e-commerce application. The proposed development environment is intended for non-programmer end-users to design and develop their own e-Commerce applications by selecting and positioning blocks on a page.",

        "Abstract": "Bandwidth inversion (network bandwidth becoming larger than computer internal bus bandwidth), Virtualization of computing, network and storage resources and web based service development environments are changing the way the services are developed and delivered over the Internet. Virtualization allows computing (CPU and memory), storage (capacity, storage I/O, storage throughput) and bandwidth to be shared among multiple service developers, and service delivery applications supporting both end customers (consumer market) and businesses (both small and medium enterprises). This is expected to provide massive scales of economy through consolidation, improved resource utilization, and, avoid the need for the investments by individual businesses to meet peak workloads through over-provisioning. Analogies to utility model (i.e., providing resources that are ubiquitously available, massively scalable, on-demand, pay-per-use and managed) are often invoked to compare network based access of computing and storage resources (often called the cloud) to telecommunications network or power grid. The lower affinity that the virtualization technologies provide between applications and the resources makes it possible to dynamically switch the resources based on their latency constraints and resource utilization profiles.",

        "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has forced educationist to come up with innovative solutions in delivering, engaging synchronous online academic modules. An innovative collaborative teaching approach was utilized in delivering programming concepts for freshers. A team of six academics functioned as a resource panel in delivering synchronous online lecture content. These interactive sessions were led by a moderator inquiring the resource panel on topics related to the content of the lecture. This was done in the same spirit on how a panel discussion would be conducted led by a moderator in a conference. Microsoft Teams Live was used in the delivery of the content to an audience of up to 800 students. Delivering a freshers programming course is known to be challenging in face- to-face delivery. A collaborative programming environment was used to engage students in live coding activities during the lectures. Students had opportunities to interact with the resource panel through quizzes, QA and through coding related activities. These lectures also introduced the innovative use of QR codes to get students engagement through a mobile device for the interactive sessions. Results based on a survey shared among the participated students, confirmed the collaborative teaching approach in conducting webinar was more effective over a traditional webinar that is conducted by one person. Interactive programming environment (Repl.it) allowed the resource personal to give feedback on the programs submitted by the students during synchronous sessions conducted. The best practices used in delivering this course can be easily adopted in delivering highly engaging online lectures for other courses.",

        "Abstract": "Storytelling is a fun activity, especially for telling a story to children which can affect the character of our children based on the story. Story from the internet resource can be a long story or a short story. For the former, it needs to make a summary to become shorter. When it is a long one, it is more difficult to tell our kids and it is more relevant to make a summary. For creating a summary, it will be easier to proceed with a computer, consequently, it needs a computer application that automatically provides a short overview of the folklore. The Indonesian folklore is summarized by several processes in a web application with a python programming language as a development tool. The process of summarization begins with processing the text that is entered by the user and it is eliminated in all of the special characters. Then the result is processed in the form of tokenizing to get a set of words. From this process, all of the set’s elements that are belong to the stop word list are removed and then the rest of them are counted each for the word frequency that they appear. After finding the word frequency, the sentences are scored by the accumulation of word frequency that they have and are sorted based on this score. Lastly, the sentences are sorted based on each of them appear from the original version and make them be a single paragraph. The result of this research is that text summarization can be carried out with the computer application and python programming languages in the form of a website. The number of sentences that are determined can be selected by the user in the program. Several Indonesian folklores are applied to the application and rated by the reader. Moreover, the application delivers 87% of reader acceptance and it is almost similar to several existing online websites that generate text summary.",

Hosting a Web service challenges the battery- life, bandwidth, and processing power constraints of low power sensor nodes. We demonstrate a lightweight implementation on MSP430 based sensor nodes with 802.15.4 radios. The implementation allows standards compliant web service clients to use the sensors but minimizes code size and energy at the sensor nodes. It allows sensor nodes to enter sleep modes. We prototype an example application for a home sensor network along with two types of sensor nodes required for it. We also show how our system enables sensor nodes to be used easily from applications written in high level languages using existing development tools.",

        "Abstract": "For the past decade, Microsoft's Visual Basic has been the programming language of choice for Windows-application developers. And recently, Microsoft has made the popular language available for Web-based applications. However, as a growing amount of application development targets the Web, other languages, such as Sun Microsystems' Java, appear to be challenging VB's dominance. VB has remained popular despite prior changes to the language. However, there may not have been as many viable alternatives as there are now today, other languages such as Java and C++ have become Web-development tools of choice. Developers may decide to use these languages because they are more mature and because VB.Net will be more complex to learn and use.",

        "Abstract": "E-Science users will want to construct, share, execute and monitor sequence of tasks. These tasks may execute on machines ranging from their local workstations to high-end, grid-enabled compute resources. Often, these tasks are legacy applications written in various programming and scripting languages and are designed to be run in a single user environment rather than as a Web application. These tasks often need to be tied together into composite applications that need to span multiple computing resources. The majority of the scientific experiments in E-Science involve orchestrating multiple tasks in the correct fashion to produce scientific computational experiments. Scientific workflows have proven to be a coherent and abstract framework that is capable of capturing such scientific experiments and hence have gained popularity among the scientific community. Many of the current E-Science projects have adopted different workflow systems and consequently have adopted custom workflow execution and description standards. We argue that the core of the execution semantics used by most scientific workflows can be expressed as a small common set, and we further investigate the possibility of having a higher level workflow description language that is capable of capturing and possibly bridging these different workflow systems. In this demonstration we present a set of E-Science development tools for managing these problems: a high level workflow composition monitoring and enactment tool, a toolkit that is capable of providing Web service interfaces for command line scientific applications, and a service registry that is used as a repository for sharing. This domain independent workflow suite will allow users from wide verity of environments to selectively and securely share their applications as Web services and construct workflows with these services. The suite also features on-demand service creation, workflow orchestration and monitoring. Furthermore, these components can be used individually or collectively to build a small to large-scale E-Science infrastructures.",

        "Abstract": "Service composition has received much interest from users on its development tools. Users may often need to use not only a single service, but also several services, and in some cases, use those services in combination with their own local applications. Users need a simple and interactive tool for service composition development to realize their needs without writing any program codes, and to reduce realization time. In our previous work, we proposed the software architecture for ad hoc service federation of Web and local resources. This architecture enables users to directly manipulate visual components, and to create new composite components for the creation of services that use Web applications, Web services, and local applications. In this architecture, every service composition is done by users' manipulation. In this paper, we will propose a new software architecture, called a PadLogSpace, for extending the service registration function and the service matching function of our previously proposed PadSpace to provide a semantic rule-definition mechanism for the service composition development.",

        "Abstract": "Digital distribution is becoming an increasingly important technique within the games industry. The leading consoles each possess their own bespoke platform to digitally deploy game applications to their users via the Internet, whilst the Windows and Mac OS X gaming market is catered for by systems such as Valve’s Steam platform. However, these digital content services are often machine-specific, proprietary systems, utilising custom web frameworks and a rigid publication system. In this paper we present an overview of the Homura games framework and +et Homura deployment middleware. Homura provides an integrated solution for Java based 3D games development. We also discuss a novel architecture and prototype system, which aims to unify the deployment of hardware accelerated Java-based 3D games applications with online capabilities. +et Homura provides a multi-tiered deployment platform that is secure, robust, and easily portable to a wide range of web servers; whilst the networking middleware component of +et Homura allows developers to build content and feature rich online games in conjunction with the Homura Engine and IDE. Due to nature of the technologies used within the +et Homura framework, it is possible to enable the creation of a game which, from development through to hosting, deployment and networking, can be created with little or no financial outlay for the developer by utilising open source technologies.",

        "Abstract": "Secure Programming Guidelines help to prevent developers from introducing vulnerabilities. But being just static text to be consulted now and then, the Guidelines are difficult to integrate in the implementation phase of software development, especially when developers are under pressure of delivering software for a deadline. In this paper, we present an IDE integration of security testing and static code analysis to detect vulnerabilities and known insecure coding patterns according to Secure Programming Guidelines. While security testing tools and static analyzers exist for security professionals, similar tools to be used by software engineers who are normally non security experts are missing. This automated tool support is non-intrusive during implementation by being fully integrated in the IDE developers use, efficient to not slow down the overall implementation effort, and extensible to consider different vulnerabilities. We implement this IDE integration as an extension to SAP HANA Web-based Development Workbench. While not proposing new security testing nor static code analysis techniques, we integrate multiple security analysis to make them usable for developers during implementation, as they are relevant threats to SAP HANA applications and thus concerned in the Secure Programming Guidelines.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we describe the technology of the process-oriented language Reflex IDE kernel development. The Reflex language, which is being maintained at the Institute of Automation and Electrometry, is a language for cyber-physical systems software specification. In the paper, we assume that the cyber-physical system is a computational core that interacts with the physical world. In the case of Reflex, the computation platform is an industrial PC. Reflex IDE (RIDE) includes a language-based editor, syntax and semantics analyzers as well as an abstract syntax tree (AST) generator, and a class library for working with the generated AST. In this work, we explain our motivation for the research, formulate the requirements for the development, and present the RIDE architecture. We describe the RIDE development process using Eclipse/Xtext tools and its user interface. We also provide an example of extending the Reflex IDE kernel with a code generator for the AVR platform. In the conclusion, we discuss the possibility of using the obtained result to create a web-version of RIDE.",

        "Abstract": "The adoption of libraries provides developers with pre-existing functionality that is both robust and easy to use. As a code base grows over time, it is natural that the libraries become stale and require updates in order to sustain innovation. Nonetheless, updating a library comes at a cost; it can potentially introduce breaking changes in the code. Thus it may require a large portion of developer time for maintenance. To alleviate this, we propose to use artificial intelligence to parse release notes documentation and automatically recommend code updates to become compatible with new versions. The solution comes in the form of an IDE plugin that can automatically detect deprecated library usages in live code bases and suggest the recommended fixes in a user-friendly way. The system architecture is comprised of three components: a web crawler that sources and pre-processes library deprecation texts, a deprecations parser that transforms those texts into a structured form, and an IDE plugin that finds and updates the parsed deprecations in a code base. In order to validate our approach, we collect and annotate a dataset of 426 API deprecations from 7 popular Python libraries and obtain an overall average weighted subtree overlap of 31.3 and 45.9 on method deprecations. Finally, we demo our tool in the form of a plugin for the industry leading Python IDE PyCharm and test it on 33 internal repositories at J.P Morgan Chase.",

        "Abstract": "Software-defined radio (SDR) is used in several areas, such as the verification and implementation of radio prototypes. The SDR environment is generally configured with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and a personal computer (PC). However, since ADCs and PCs are fixed configurations, reconfigurations are needed in order to respond to different data sources and computing environments when the radio protocol or SDR are indefinite. To enable this reconfiguration, we present a cloud platform that has scalable computing resources and data sources deployed in a wide area, using an existing SDR development environment. In order to apply the existing SDR development environment to the cloud platform, UI separation and data management are required. In this manuscript, we implement an SDR environment for many unspecified users through UI separation by selecting the GNU Radio Companion (GRC) as the platform. We focused on compatibility and flexibility with regard to the configuration, in order to allow the user to adjust the resources consumed by the PC. The results show that one particular implementation of the remote SDR execution and development is suitable. In addition, we confirmed the compatibility with GRC in terms of user skills and software assets, and achieved distributed processing to allocate resources between the client and cloud according to the user's discretion, by dividing the processing of the SDR on the basis of the function unit.",

        "Abstract": "The advent of cloud computing has offered to developers a new appealing paradigm to deploy their applications without capital investments. Resources can now be acquired on-demand in a flexible, scalable and rapid way. However, cloud providers lack of native mechanisms to guarantee the Quality of Service required by specific application domains. High availability can be achieved by replication of critical components. Since outages could affect the entire cloud provider, replication can be effective only by using multiple providers. In this paper we tackle the above problem and present an approach to guarantee availability requirements of cloud-based applications by exploiting replication on multiple clouds to reduce unavailability, still limiting costs. More precisely, we propose: i) an approach to model, at design time, the application, its availability requirements and the characteristics of the used clouds, and ii) a self-adaptive technique responsible, at runtime, of both in-cloud scaling policies and traffic routing among different cloud providers, by means of a control-theoretical approach. We integrated the modeling approach in the Palladio Bench IDE and developed a runtime self-adaptation controller in Matlab. The controller has been evaluated against different workload conditions, costs variations and service failures in simulated scenarios. The controller has been able to provide the desired availability minimizing costs.",

        "Abstract": "This paper introduces a novel blockchain-based decentralized federation model that embodies quality verification for cloud providers who lease computing resources from each other. The blockchain structure removes the barriers of a traditional centralized federation and offers a fully distributed and transparent administration by enforcing the involved agents to maintain consensus on the data. For a blockchain-based federation, it is vital to avoid blind-trust on the claimed SLA guarantees and monitor the quality of service which is highly desirable considering the multi-tenancy characteristic of cloud services. Due to the fact that the blockchain network is unable to access the outside world, it cannot handle, by its own, providers misbehavior in terms of SLA violations. Thus, we introduce oracle as a verifier agent to monitor the quality of the service and report to the smart contract agents deployed on the blockchain. Oracle is a trusted third-party agent who can communicate with the outside world of the blockchain network. The interaction between cloud service providers (either providing a service or requesting it from another provider) and the oracle through smart contracts comprises a system of autonomous and utility maximizer agents. Cloud requesters seek to receive high quality services with constant monitoring at cheap prices or even with no charge, while cloud providers aim to have a balanced work-load with less preserved capacity, and the oracle tends to charge higher for their monitoring services. Therefore, to model this conflicting situation, we formulate a dynamic Stackelberg differential game to optimize the cost of using the oracle and maximize the profit of the agents with the role of provider agent as a leader, and the requester and verifier agents as followers. Our designed Stackelberg differential game can seize the dynamicity of users' demand and resource provisioning in a competitive cloud market. We implemented our proposed decentralized model using the Solidity language in the remix IDE on the Ethereum network. We further evaluated the optimal controls and agents' profit with real-world data simulated for three concrete cloud providers. The results revealed that the requester agent initiates most of the quality verification requests at the beginning to the middle time of the contract. Thus, the provider agent could reserve less computing resources considering the fact that it could share the workload among other customers' computing resources during the peak-time. Moreover, imposing a higher penalty on the provider agent increased the capacity and decreased the number of requests for quality verification at the equilibrium. The evaluation also disclosed that the impact of timing in the dynamic pricing strategy of the verifier agent is very minimal, and the provisioning capacity of the provider is strongly correlated with the monitoring price.",

        "Abstract": "The Andes mountains play a fundamental role in the configuration of the weather and hydrology of all the west of South America. Currently there is a large number of satellites collecting several kinds of environmental information in this region, and often the volume of information available is huge. This massive availability of satellite information, combined with the processing capabilities of modern computers, makes it possible to analyze large volumes of data, but strongly restricted by an advanced knowledge in spatial information management and development tools. In many opportunities this determine the type and level of detail of the analyzes that could be carried out both at a scientific-academic level and for natural resources management institutions, in different sectors of the Andes. Due to technical and operational restrictions related to processing big volumes of satellite information. A web platform for automatic processing this information was developed, and an implementation of MODIS satellite images of daily resolution was carried out. The platform will allow obtaining, in a simple and accessible way, maps and time series of different variables (snow and cloud cover, soil temperature, etc.).Thats for the entire of argentinian and chilean cordillera. The generated information has a large number of potential users and many applications, as Hidrology and Climate studies, but also for decision makers in the dump water distribution management.",

Multicore processors are commonly employed to accommodate the high computational requirements. Meanwhile, skills required to build such a complex program is still uncommon due to the limited exposure to multicore environment in embedded system. There is a need for platform that facilitates learning and development of multicore processor in embedded system, while keeping the learning curve relatively easy. Arduino IDE is a widely used and user-friendly platform, but officially only supports single core processors.

        "Abstract": "In today's world, mobile phones play an important role in improving our lives. Various applications for mobile banking, travel ticket booking, and health monitoring are making life easier and more convenient. With the use of mobile phones and their applications, we have entered a digital age where almost everything is available at our fingertips. A major task for mobile app developers is to choose the correct tool for developing apps. There are three basic technologies i.e. Native, Web, and Hybrid for developing mobile apps. The choice of mobile app development tool or technology will depend on the specific needs of the project. Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses, and developers must consider factors such as budget, timeline, and performance requirements when selecting a development approach. The most outstanding performance and user experience are provided by native apps, but their development can be costly and time-consuming. Web applications are the least expensive and easiest to develop, but they may not offer the same level of performance or access to device features as native or hybrid apps. Hybrid apps offer an acceptablecompromise between performance and development costs. In this paper, we mainly focus on different mobile app development tools and techniques e.g. React Native, Flutter, Ionic, Xamarin, and programming languages used e.g. HTML, CSS, and J avaScript along with their applications and limitations. Apart from this, we have also done a comparative analysis of these tools and techniques and programming languages that are beneficial to developers and researchers working in the area of mobile app development.",

        "Abstract": "The Online Project Assessment and Supervision System (oPENs) is developed with the aim to make it as a standard system that can be used in the Final Year Project (FYP) course for all UiTM campuses offering Diploma in Electrical Engineering (DEE). The main focus of this article is to introduce the system designed, which was developed as a medium of interaction between lecturer, students and course coordinator in managing the FYP process especially in the stage of project's proposal preparation. Two main elements applied in oPENs are project evaluation and weekly report monitoring. In existing system, all hardcopy of the FYP1 related documents such as project approval form, evaluation form, as well as the project progress validation form should be submitted to the course coordinator. This practice sometimes will cause unexpected problems such as loss of forms, lack of documentation storage space, delay of submission of forms and so on. This makes it difficult for the course coordinators to effectively manage the documentation especially if it involves hundreds of students at one time. The oPENs system is developed using language of PHP Technology and the development tools used Macromedia Dreamweaver (which includes a local web server) and Java scripting language. The backend database is supported by MySQL Database, which is built into the database.",

        "Abstract": "Test case recording and playback technology, normally implemented as a test case recorder, has been widely applied in the industry. One of the key research topics is how to determine if a web page has entered a ready state before the recorder can perform the next test command? If a web element is incorrectly selected during playback, the related test command will fail to process. This research puts forward four kinds of automatic waiting mechanism for playing test commands. The experiment result shows that the waiting time can be determined dynamically and automatically, so that testers do not have to manually add waiting commands thereby reducing the time and error of artificial discrimination. The proposed mechanisms were implemented as parts of the SideeX open source web testing software and have been further adopted by the new Selenium IDE and Katalon Recorder. Currently, over 60,000 web testers around the world run the mechanisms.",

But it is difficult for the beginners, especially for high-school students, to learn C programming because the learning supporting environment is not enough. This research proposes PROVIT(PROgramming VIsualization Tool) for Web, an e-Learning supporting environment for C programming education. PROVIT for Web has many features:(1) It can be used to write, run and check C programs without installing any IDE, (2) It especially can be used at lecture to show the execution of C program step by step, and (3) It can detect more run time error often seen in beginner's program. Web PROVIT has been used in a C programming course in author's university. This paper reports the design, implementation and the result of experimental use of PROVIT for Web.",

        "Abstract": "Cloud computing technology usage has emerged as a prominent field in providing the computation services to the users using the internet. The 3As-AnyTime, AnyWhere and AnyDevice concept changed the industry towards user-centric needs to collaborate and connect with people, which makes software industries to adopt the cloud-based development environment. This created the scope for educationist to enable the students with the skills related to cloud computing technology. A course on distributed and cloud computing is introduced at the undergraduate level for catering to this. The authors discuss the challenges faced in teaching-learning cloud computing technology and the method followed to overcome these. The two main challenges are designing the course content and adopting suitable open source infrastructure tools for hands-on experience. The authors have put efforts in adoption and usage of cloud computing in undergraduate engineering level by proposing a modified Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). This model helped to identify different parameters/attributes to improve academic performance. An activity-based laboratory course is designed in line with the theory course. All the activities are implemented using the open source software environment. The activities planned in the course are assessed based on the outcome based evaluation. The graduate attribute addressed in the course are domain knowledge gain in cloud computing concepts, problem-solving, usage of modern tools and life-long learning. The average attainment of the stated graduate attribute is 77.89% in the course internal semester assessment. The effectiveness of proposed method is validated by defining hypotheses relating to the research questions framed. Results prominently speak about the advantage of TAM and its implementation in the course.",

        "Abstract": "The test executivepsilas primary purpose is to control the flow of testing on a given piece of automated test equipment. It accomplishes this by loading and executing a test programpsilas compiled executable code. Code execution enables the test executive to control the instruments, make decisions and direct the testing in accordance with the instructions contained in the test program. In addition to this primary basic function; Test Executives can be enhanced to provide additional options to improve overall testing and diagnosis. Debug tools can also be built into the test executive in order to provide a rich set of debug options for the test engineer. These options should be readily useable and easy to perceive. Also, since diagnosis is a huge part of Unit Under Test (UUT) testing, the debug capabilities should be vast and readily utilizable. In addition, backward compatibility, built-in securities, ease of operator use, reliability, and maintainability should also be considered in order to produce the ultimate test executive. Keeping this in mind, a team of experienced test engineers designed and developed a test executive (known as the WT2000) rich with execution options, debug tools, development tools and other vital TPS aids the overall performance of a strong test executive as a result of these enhancements and will be discussed in detail in this paper. The vastness or strength of debug tools and will also be discussed in this paper. This paper doesn't merely identify options and user friendliness of a test executive, but also the paper explains a real application and an actual test environment and the various techniques an operator and an engineer can utilize to perform test and diagnosis. The paper will also explain the use of a Test Station Emulator and how it allows test programs to be run and debugged using work stations not connected to the test system. Also, shown and explained will be in-depth debug capabilities and Soft Front Panels that allow instruments to be controlled from the test system's computer console. Another prime area which will be explained is a Test Navigator that provides the test station with its operators interface. This is a Browser Based Interface, i.e., acting much like an Internet Browser. This makes the test station extremely easy to operate and reduces training requirements to an absolute minimum.",

        "Abstract": "Many block-based programming environments have proven to be effective at engaging novices in learning programming. However, most restrict access to the outside world, limiting learners to commands and computing resources built in to the environment. Some allow learners to drag and drop files, connect to sensors and robots locally or issue HTTP requests. But in a world where most of the applications in our daily lives are distributed (i.e., their functionality depends on communicating with other programs or accessing resources and data on the internet), the lack of support for beginners to envision and create such distributed programs is a lost opportunity. This paper argues that it is not only feasible, but crucial, to create environments with simple yet powerful abstractions that open up distributed computing and other widely used but advanced computing concepts including networking, the Internet of Things, and cybersecurity to novices. By thus removing the walls around our environments, we can expand opportunities for learning considerably: programs can access a wealth of online data and web services, and communicate with other projects. Moreover, these changes can enable young learners to collaborate with each other during program construction whether they share their physical location or study remotely. Importantly, providing access to the wider world will also help counter widespread student perceptions that block-based environments are mere toys, and show that they are capable of creating compelling applications. The paper presents NetsBlox, a programming environment that supports these ideas and shows that tools can be designed to democratize access to powerful ideas in computing.",

        "Abstract": "This paper analyses the various problems that are there in a large metropolitan city and provide solutions to some of its concerns. The objective of the model is to design perfect system to analyze the Air quality and measure it which is well suited for a Smart City Infrastructure. Here an IoT based Indoor air quality monitoring system and a security system which uses RFID is demonstrated. The system relies on Arduino IDE, ESP8266 Node MCU Wi-Fi Module, MFRC522 reader, RFID tags DHT22 Temperature, Humidity Sensor and MQ2 Gas Sensor and ThingSpeak is an Open Source IoT Web API service that enables us to gather, view, and analyze real-time data streams in the cloud. By registering, it can build a Channel and name it, along with the fields where it wants to display sensor data. It is designed to measure the air pollutants levels, which include CO, CO2 and other pollutants and the results are outputted in the form of graphs and it also checks whether the scanned Ids are valid or not with the help of RFID reader. This paper can monitor the air quality all the time and the results can been seen from anywhere in anytime all the person needs are the credentials for the channel, a device for browsing the net and a working internet connection. It can also be used for Remote Monitoring purposes of various parameters like Humidity, Temperature and Gas levels without Human Intervention. Along with the use of the Thingview App and the same channel ID to access the data remotely from your phone. Since each of the RFID tags have unique id and all the authorized ids are stored in the databases of the module which easily determines the Unauthorized tags which will help in security. The Node MCU is a low cost device supports WIFI networks and well suited for IoT [9] based system.",

        "Abstract": "As Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW) are becoming more and more popular, there is an increasing demand for new web services and developments. In particular, there is a need of new technologies (often referred to as Web3D) to create and manipulate interactive three-dimensional (3D) environments on the Web. A major problem in this subject is the lack of specialized 3D graphics libraries for Internet, with similar functionalities to those of OpenGL for standalone applications. Although several APIs (Java3D, GJ4JAVA, JOGL, LWJGL, jGL) have been proposed to tackle this issue, none of them has become an official part of core Java package so far. Consequently, it is still hard to build reliable Internet-oriented 3D graphics programs providing the web users with the same realism and interactivity usually found on standalone applications. This paper proposes a based-on-Java framework to develop interactive 3D graphics applications embedded in web pages. Our approach is not based on the development of new programming tools, the emphasis being placed upon the careful selection of already existing technologies (also described in this paper) that provide the best results for our goals along with the optimized design of the workflow. Some applications aimed at showing the potential of our approach are also briefly reported.",

Runtime exceptions is one of such important class of bugs that is actively discussed on Stack Overflow. However, it may be difficult for beginner programmers to come up with appropriate keywords for search. Moreover, they need to switch their attentions between IDE and browser, and it is time-consuming. To overcome these difficulties, we proposed a method, \"Q&A MAESTRO\", to find suitable Q&A posts automatically for Java runtime exception by utilizing structure information of codes described in programming Q&A website. In this paper, we describe a usage scenario of IDE-plugin, the architecture and user interface of the implementation, and results of user studies.

It provides the benefits such as language independent development, less error-prone and increased quality. The executable programming codes are created by code transformation feature of model-driven development tools as well. Nevertheless, this technique brings the problems along all its benefits. First of all, code transformation from user interfaces by development tools, creates complicated structure to analyze and modify. Another challenge is to deal with the processes which are triggering each other. In addition, data connected process adaptation is a problem as well. All these issues eventually require the integration of discrete modules. This study provides not only a proposal structure to deal with integration problem in web development, but also provides the evaluation criteria for classification of the integration processes.",

The execution environment allows the running of the application, possibly after some customization operations. We envision three main ways of using JWeb: as a training tool, for students and practitioners; as a fast prototyping tool, to test different design hypothesis, and to come up with a final design; as a tool for fast development and deployment of complex, high quality, Web applications.",

        "Abstract": "Dreamweaver has powerful database access functions, using windows operating without coding can operate database. Existing literatures only describe sequential steps, but, the network database connection mechanism and the steps corresponding to program code in WEB system are not further expounded. This paper analyzes database connection mechanism of WEB application system based on three-tier architecture, and the corresponding relationship between main steps and auto-generated code using windows operating to achieve database access in the Dreamweaver development environment, and then discusses two more complex issues associated with database connection in WEB application systems development-principle and realization of transaction processing and database connection pool technology.",

The existing software for power system simulating and planning is essentially desktop application, which limits its application power. Due to the worldwide expansion of interest in Internet in the past few years, an Internet-based application development has appeared in some technical fields. A great progress on the Internet technique makes it easy to implement the Web-based system. In this paper a process is described for implementing the Internet-based simulation and plan platform of power systems. The platform supports some necessary calculation or analysis methods of the power system simulation and plan, such as load flow calculation, short circuit calculation, harmonic analysis, load forecasting, plan optimization of electric networks, and economic analysis. The cookies in the client-side and the session state objects in server-side are used for data exchanging between Web pages. Both XML documents and databases are supported for interchanging input data and results between Web servers and clients. The structure of XML and the way to construct the Web services are discussed. The development environment of the platform is analyzed.",

        "Abstract": "An effective way to learn about software development tools is by directly observing peers' workflows. However, these tool knowledge transfer events happen infrequently because developers must be both colocated and available. We explore an online social screen casting system that removes the dependencies of colocation and availability while maintaining the beneficial tool knowledge transfer of peer observation. Our results from a formative study indicate these online observations happen more frequently than in-person observations, but their effects are only temporary. We conclude that while peer observation facilitates online knowledge transfer, it is not the only component -- other social factors may be involved.",

Among other capabilities, it allows users to: apply pre-defined metrics to components of a system at various levels (feature, class, cluster or the entire system); define new metrics, through mathematical formulae or Boolean selection, and apply them to projects; store measurement results, as well as metric definitions, into an XML archive that can be stored locally or made available on the Web for future reference; and compare the measurements on a system to those on record locally or on a Web site. Interactive Software Engineering Inc. (ISE) has released, on its own Web site, an archive recording the metric properties of its basic libraries, which is available to any other project for comparison.",

The use of the right data structure improves the performance of algorithms and increases time and space efficiency.Data structures involve the usage of pointers and references for representing user’s data. It is very difficult for new users/learners to see how these pointers and references change. It is also very difficult to find a correlation between the program being executed and the data structure being used in the code.Immersive understanding and involved learning are enabled by visualisation of these data structures. As a result, the user can appreciate the way the pointers and references are used in data structures.The aim of Code-Viz is to provide data structure specific visualisations and animations that are both intuitive and accurate. The tool is language agnostic, supporting major programming languages (currently C and Python). Code-Viz is implemented as a browser-based tool with a code editor where users can visualize code without the need to install any software, thus facilitating ease of access.",

        "Abstract": "Grid computing, one of the latest buzzwords in the ICT industry, is emerging as a new paradigm for Internet-based parallel and distributing computing. It enables the sharing, selection, and aggregation of geographically distributed autonomous resources, such as computers (PCs, servers, clusters, supercomputers), databases, and scientific instruments, for solving large-scale problems in science, engineering, and commerce. It leverages existing IT infrastructure to optimize compute resources and manage data and computing workloads. The developers of Grids and Grid applications need to address numerous challenges: security, heterogeneity, dynamicity, scalability, reliability, service creation and pricing, resource discovery, resource management, application dAbsecomposition and service composition, and qualify of services. A number of projects around the world are developing technologies that help address one or more of these challenges. To address some of these challenges, the Gridbus Project at the University of Melbourne has developed grid middleware technologies that (1) enable the creation of Utility Grids, which provide economic incentive for Grid service providers for sharing resources; and (2) support rapid development and optimal deployment of eScience and eBusiness applications on enterprise and global Grids. The components of Gridbus middleware are: Grid application development environment for rapid creation of distributed applications, Grid service broker and application scheduler, Grid workflow management engine, SLA (service-level agreements) based Scheduler for clusters, Web-services based Grid market directory (GMD), Grid accounting services, Gridscape for creation of dynamic and interactive resource monitoring portals, Portlets for creation of Grid portals that support web-based management of Grid applications execution, and GridSim toolkit for performance evaluation. In addition, Gridbus also includes a widely used .NET-based enterprise Grid technology and Grid web services framework to support the integration of both Windows and Unix-class resources for Grid computing.",

        "Abstract": "An integral network issue in cloud computing for mobile environments is service availability. For a mobile user the connection to the cloud maybe difficult to obtain due to traffic congestion, failure of network and weak signal. In mobile cloud computing, the concept of distributed query processing takes place which relates to the data distribution across multiple machines and we need to process queries. This paper aims to determine what computation to place where in a network scenario. This motivates event based adaptive query processing. Data query operators need to generate events, much like exceptions in a programming environment which need to be handled by the query processor. The overall aim of the paper is to analyze efficient query processing when an event occurs and calculate the minimum query response time in three network scenarios based on capabilities and factors of a local, adhoc network and mobile cloud environment.",

However, most developing countries face lack of proper health care resources to cater to the needs of every citizen. In critical cases, the patients have to be continuously monitored for their bio-parameters and immediate response from doctors is essential. So, it is most essential to improve the healthcare infrastructure. The emerging trend in healthcare sector is to change the existing healthcare services and change the routine medical check-ups from hospital centric to person centric. Here, A Holistic Approach for the Development of Real Time Patient Health Monitoring and Alerting through IOT is proposed and implemented using ThingSpeak site as the cloud. This work presents the design and construction of a working prototype for smart health care system using Internet of Things which can provide Quality Health Care to everyone. In this system, the prototype developed uses an embedded system built using Atmega328 microcontroller and it is programmed using Arduino IDE. The prototype gathers biomedical and orientation information from sensors and location information from GPS of the monitored person and convey them to healthcare cloud system utilizing IOT platform. The sensor data is sent to the network through Wi-Fi link. The Thingspeak channel is updated at regular intervals and helps to maintain the medical history of the patient. The Thingspeak cloud computing handles authentication, privateness, safety, and data management and provides accessibility. The system obtains the parameter valus and compares them with the standard values and in the case of an emergency, a local alarm is triggered and an SMS text message is sent to the doctor with the details of authentication. The data from cloud platform can be accessed by the concerned doctor anytime, after a proper authentication and diagnosis and decisions can be made. The data can be accessed only by the authorized user (doctor) through password authentication.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents OCCI simulation extension, a generic simulator for any kind of resources. To achieve that, we first study the position of cloud simulator entities against OCCI model. Afterward, we define an OCCI extension simulation. In order to study the usefulness of this extension, we implement in the second time a module for Eclipse IDE to define OCCI configuration graphically. This tool uses the proposed extension. From the generated OCCI configuration, cloud resources are extracted and used by Cloud Sim simulator upon OCCI metamodel. Multiple experiments with different configuration were conducted to validate the generality of the proposed simulation extension.",

With the advancement in the technology, the cloud users are increasing rapidly. Even though Cloud resources are infinite but they are not enough to fulfill the increasing demands of the users. This paper proposed the mechanism of handling multiple requests from multiple users to the cloud. It has two parts: in the first part all the VM's are monitored and the optimal VM with sufficient resources to handle the requests is selected and in the second part the tasks are allocated the required resources. It also checks the load on each virtual machine by continuous monitoring and if the load is increased, migration is done to the next VM using the phenomenon of Throttle Load Balancer. This complete system handles the faults even before it is occurred, so it falls under the proactive fault tolerance. The simulation is conducted within Netbeans IDE and Cloudsim 4.0 and evaluation parameters are load balancing degree, throughput and execution cost.",

The sensed temperature variation is provided for processing through the IoT platform. Using arduino and GSM module extracted data can be sent to the cloud and can be used for data logging on the cloud. Using serial monitor of arduino IDE data has been observed.

        "Abstract": "Web applications have become an integral part of the daily lives of millions of users. Unfortunately, web applications are also frequently targeted by attackers, and critical vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting and SQL injection are still common. As a consequence, much effort in the past decade has been spent on mitigating web application vulnerabilities. Current techniques focus mainly on sanitization: either on automated sanitization, the detection of missing sanitizers, the correctness of sanitizers, or the correct placement of sanitizers. However, these techniques are either not able to prevent new forms of input validation vulnerabilities such as HTTP Parameter Pollution, come with large runtime overhead, lack precision, or require significant modifications to the client and/or server infrastructure. In this paper, we present IPAAS, a novel technique for preventing the exploitation of cross-site scripting and SQL injection vulnerabilities based on automated data type detection of input parameters. IPAAS automatically and transparently augments otherwise insecure web application development environments with input validators that result in significant and tangible security improvements for real systems. We implemented IPAAS for PHP and evaluated it on five real-world web applications with known cross-site scripting and SQL injection vulnerabilities. Our evaluation demonstrates that IPAAS would have prevented 83% of SQL injection vulnerabilities and 65% of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities while incurring no developer burden.",

Yet existing development environments are largely disconnected from these resources. In this work, we explore how to provide useful web page recommendations to developers by focusing on the problem of refinding web pages that a developer has previously used. We present the results of a study about developer browsing activity in which we found that 13.7% of developers visits to code-related pages are revisits and that only a small fraction (7.4%) of these were initiated through a low-cost mechanism, such as a bookmark. To assist with code-related revisits, we introduce Reverb, a tool which recommends previously visited web pages that pertain to the code visible in the developer's editor. Through a field study, we found that, on average, Reverb can recommend a useful web page in 51% of revisitation cases.",

        "Abstract": "Commercial tools for software engineering include many development environments to support the design process. These integrated tools are usually distributed through traditional retail channels, with vendors increasingly giving customers the option of downloading products from the Web. The tools are installed on user client machines and are usually duplicated for actual tool use at customer sites. Users are responsible for installation, maintenance and upgrade procedures. We developed Web Lab as part of a project sponsored by the European Commission to advance rule-based, object-oriented technologies for developing database applications. The Web Lab was designed to help disseminate the research results. It enables remote use of a design environment for database applications, including a repository for application development that provides a protected workspace. However, as software becomes more and more a commodity, we expect vendors to begin selling software use rather than tools, an option that is particularly attractive in the context of thin clients running on network computers. Web Lab demonstrates the feasibility of this idea for commercial software distribution. We describe the Web Lab project, its implementation, and plans for further development.",

        "Abstract": "Cyber physical systems are often built using networks of components containing physical and computational resources, enabling the design of distributed applications that collect data from remote sensors and manipulate remote actuators, located on local networks or on far away locations. The communication protocol presented in this paper was designed to support the communication between components of distributed applications. In addition, it includes remote debug and monitoring capabilities, to support the detection and resolution of errors and design mistakes on nodes running on remote locations. Employing the JSON/HTTP standards, the proposed protocol is Web browser friendly, suitable for the creation of Web based applications and user interfaces, but it may be employed on most programming environments that offer libraries to support those standards. As it is based on HTTP, it can easily traverse most firewall configurations and used through proxies. Development of the proposed protocol started on the IOPTTools framework, but the current version was implemented as part of the IOPT-Flow framework, aiming the development of distributed CPS applications based on graphical formalism combining Petri nets and dataflows. Both tool frameworks are available at http://gres.uninova.pt.",

The system under test (SUT) is a cloud based application for monitoring and controlling building operations from Siemens Building Technologies, currently under development. Three examples for the applications of combinatorial testing in the front-end are analyzed, incorporating the CT model into automation using Protractor test framework's end-to-end (e2e) UI tests in behavioral driven development (BDD) style. The manner in which the CT model translates automation code is studied. A scenario where a sequence of actions are incorporated into a CT model is illustrated; with a focus on veri?cation of these sequences, compositions of the actions and streamlining the expected assertions per the test oracle.",

        "Abstract": "One of the grand challenges in computing education is to teach programming to novice students. Typically, novices find it difficult to understand compiler error messages. Hence a prototype of web based programming assistance tool has been developed to assist them in the programming process. It is an online program development environment to help beginners to debug programs in C language. The debugger component assists to identify the errors and fix them. Hints will be provided to deal with the compiler error messages. The system comprises of a GUI editor, a GCC compiler and a central database. The database stores a list of almost all compiler error messages, and the corresponding fixes and hints. Based on the error messages generated after compilation, queries are sent to the database and the relevant fixes are presented to the programmer.",

        "Abstract": "People's ability to freely and anonymously share their thoughts and feelings online on social media platforms is contributing to a rising issue of hate speech. Hate speech has the potential to hurt both people and groups, contribute to the polarisation of society, and even provoke acts of physical violence. Therefore, identifying and removing hate speech from online social media is an important task for the purpose of maintaining an online environment that is healthy and respectful. A method based on deep learning is proposed in this study for differentiating between hate speech and other types of communication that may be found in online social media. The solution that has been developed makes use of a natural language processing (NLP) and long term short memory (LSTM) model that is trained on a huge dataset consisting of tweets that have been annotated. Tweets that include hate speech and tweets that do not contain hate speech were both included in the dataset and were labelled by human annotators. Python software with IDE of Spyder version 3.7 is used to carry out the simulation work. The accuracy level reached overall is 91.14%.",

Compared with traditional machine learning methods, convolutional neural network has outstanding technical advantages in video image pedestrian detection. In this regard, based on the practical application requirements of pedestrian detection, this paper proposes a video image pedestrian detection system based on YOLO v5 algorithm, aiming at completing accurate and efficient pedestrian detection tasks in the form of visual detection, and further broadening the application scenarios of target detection technology. The system takes Python as the development environment, completes the deployment and training of YOLO v5 algorithm based on PyTorch, and combines with Django framework to form a Web application that integrates remote login, online upload, real-time detection, visual result output and other functions. Practice has proved that the whole system runs stably, and the training efficiency and detection effect of YOLO v5 algorithm are obviously improved under Pascal VOC data set, which can meet the practical application requirements.",

        "Abstract": "One of the common information services required in a campus environment is online directory services such as phone directory. This paper discusses the implementation of such a directory service. Besides being an online phone directory, this system also provides additional staff information such as staff photographs and their academic interests. This Staff Directory is built to supplement other applications such as NTU Helpdesk, Electronic Mail and Staff Administration applications. In order to meet this object, the Staff Directory needs to be built based on a client-server model in a heterogeneous environment. MS-Windows 3.1 has been chosen as the common GUI platform for integrating the various campus information services. For the Staff Directory, the client development tools used include Asymmetrix's ToolBook and Borland's Turbo C++. The server is based on a Vaxstation 4000 running VMS. The server development tools used include VAX C, and the DDS (Distributed File System) file system. DDS was chosen because it was already in use by the campus-wide electronic mail application in NTU. For communications between the client and the server, DECmessageQ for MS-DOS and VMS are used. DECmessageQ was chosen because it can work in a multivendor environment and has advanced features such as message recovery services and selective broadcast services. More importantly, with a simple set of only 12 calls, it simplifies and expedites the development of interprocess communications by hiding the complexities of underlying network protocols such as DECnet, TCP/IP, SNA and etc.",

In iWeb, a context model is established and context information is collected systematically according to the context model. An innovative service selection approach based on context and QoS is proposed in the framework as the leverage of implementation of application adaption. This approach can select the best services respect to QoS and context. For the usability of iWeb, thousands of available web services are collected and grouped by functionality in order to make service selection practicable. By providing development tools, service-oriented web application can be developed easily, and can fulfill its functionality using the selected services. The framework makes service-oriented web application more adaptive and flexible.",

However, with the increase demand to cope with changing environments, there is a need for a more intelligent type of service - adaptive web service. In this paper we concentrate on policy based management of web services, where the web services have adaptive behaviors. The paper proposes the design, implementation and evaluation of a suite of policy development tools which (i) facilitate the specification of adaptive web services (which are to be managed by a policy based system) using finite state machines to describe the permitted adaptive behaviors, (ii) supports the specification of supportable (functionally correct) high level management policies, the automated refinement of these high level policies and the auto-generation of enforceable (low level) policies. The paper also presents a methodology and an evaluation to the approach. The paper also provides a brief presentation of related research in policy refinement and distinguishes the proposed approach from published work.",

        "Abstract": "In the last few years, the Web has been established as a platform for interactive applications. However, creating Web applications involves numerous challenges since the Web has been created to serve static content. In particular, the separation of the client- and the server-side, being only connected through the unidirectional Hypertext Transfer Protocol, forces developers to apply two programming languages including different libraries, conventions, and tools. Developers create expert knowledge by specializing on a few of all involved technologies. Consequently, the diverse knowledge of team members makes collaboration in Web development laboriously. We present the Orca framework that allows developers to work collaboratively on client-server applications in a single object-oriented programming language. Based on the Smalltalk programming language, full access to existing libraries, and a bidirectional messaging abstraction, Orca provides a consistent environment that supports common idioms and patterns in client- and server-side code. It reduces expert knowledge and the number of development tools and, thus, facilitates the collaboration of Web developers.",

        "Abstract": "Businesses have already started to exploit potential uses of cloud computing as a new paradigm for promoting their services. Although the general concepts they practically focus on are: viability, survivability, adaptability, etc., however, there is still a lack of forming mechanisms to sustain viability with adaptation of new requirements in cloud-based applications. This has inspired a pressing need to adopt new methodologies and abstract models which support system acquisition for self-adaptation, thus guaranteeing autonomic cloud application behaviour. In this paper we use state-of-the-art Neptune framework as runtime adaptive software development environment developed mainly for distributed computing supported with intention-oriented modelling language. The representation and adaptation of goal based model artifacts and their intrinsic properties requirements will in turn support distributed service based applications running in the cloud. This harnesses obedient system behaviour with respect to its functional and non-functional characteristics.",

        "Abstract": "Cloud computing is surfacing as the next disruptive utility paradigm. It provides massive storage capabilities, the development environment for application developers through virtual machines. It is also the home of software and databases that are accessible, on-demand. As security is the main constraint holding companies to engage into the cloud fully, third-party auditors (TPA) are becoming more and more common in cloud computing implementations. Of course, involving auditors comes with its issues such as trust and processing overhead. To achieve productive auditing, we need to (1) accomplish efficient auditing without requesting the data location, nor introducing processing overhead to the cloud client; (2) avoid involving new security vulnerabilities during the auditing process. In this paper, we propose a novel method allowing to detect a dishonest TPA: the Light-weight Accountable Privacy Preserving (LAPP) Protocol. This protocol determines the malicious behavior of the TPA. To validate the proposed protocol's effectiveness, simulation experiments have been conducted, using the GreenCloud simulator. Based on our simulation results, we confirm that our proposed protocol provides better outcomes as compared to the other known contending protocols concerning reliability, communication cost, and the auditing time per task by a fraction of the invalid responses.",

        "Abstract": "With the advancement of the Internet technologies, cloud services and various open data, there have been many active attempts to develop mashup services. To develop a mashup service, many data sources and service platforms should be interlinked. Therefore, efficient ways of interconnecting various service platforms and managing data are essential to provide easy service development environment. However, current mashup service development environments do not provide any of them, which forces each developer to fully understand every platforms, interfaces and data format to develop a mahsup service. So, it gives a big burden to mashup service developers and also hinders growth of mashup service industry. In this paper, we propose ICBMS Smart Mediator which connects IoT, cloud, big data, mobile, and security platforms and helps developers to easily utilize them with less overhead and provides easy access to data. We have designed and implemented the proposed ICBMS Smart Mediator and created a new mahsup service with the ICBMS Smart Mediator.",

Source code browsers are not sufficient for understanding object-oriented programs. The authors have combined a strongly-typed object-oriented language with an integrated, interactive development environment. For several reasons, they designed the compiler as an integral component of the environment. Coupling the compiler and the browser simplifies symbol table management in the compiler. Conversely, the same coupling ensures that information is semantically checked before the browser displays it. Also, programmers do not have to understand the class hierarchy because the compiler creates class views.<>",

        "Abstract": "The prominence of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is increasing significantly due to their ability to drastically reduce carbon-dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions from road transportation, contributing to the fight against global warming. However, the limited availability of charging stations and the time required for charging have been inhibiting factors for potential buyers to adopt EVs. As a result, there is a need for a smart charging system to reduce the challenges of locating charging station and checking slot availability. The primary objective of the project is to design and implement an EV charger featuring a rectifier circuit with Power Factor Correction (PFC) controller using a flyback converter topology. Additionally, a web application for EV charging station \"ChargEVfy\" has been developed. This application aims to assist EV drivers in identifying nearby charging stations. Once a charging station is located, users have an option to check available charging slots and even reserve a slot in advance for their vehicle by registering on \"ChargEVfy\" website. The web application provides an option whereby the users can input their starting point and destination. Subsequently, the webpage displays a roadmap with all accessible charging stations along the journey. To enable these functionalities, the proposed system is equipped with IR sensors, Arduino Nano, ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, Blynk IoT cloud server and web application development tools.",

        "Abstract": "Software engineers often use record/replay tools to enable the automated testing of web applications. Tests created in this manner can then be used to regression test new versions of the web applications as they evolve. Web application tests recorded by record/replay tools, however, can be quite brittle, they can easily break as applications change. For this reason, researchers have begun to seek approaches for automatically repairing record/replay tests. To date, however, there have been no comprehensive attempts to characterize the causes of breakagesin record/replay tests for web applications. In this work, wepresent a taxonomy classifying the ways in which record/replay tests for web applications break, based on an analysis of 453 versions of popular web applications for which 1065 individual test breakages were recognized. The resulting taxonomy can help direct researchers in their attempts to repair such tests. It can also help practitioners by suggesting best practices when creating tests or modifying programs, and can help researchers with other tasks such as test robustness analysis and IDE design.",

The first wave of prime time agents, as exemplified by Firefly from Firefly Networks Inc. (formerly Agents Inc.), are personal assistants that simplify Web surfing. Firefly has became a media darling-everyone from Time magazine to local TV stations is featuring the little critters. More than half a million users have Firefly agents to help them shop on the Web for music, movies, and books. Two other Web agents are just coming to market-WebTamer from AgentSoft, and WiseWire from Empirical Media. Plus we are seeing the first embedding of agent technology into application specific software such as Swiss Bank's Balet (balance sheet estimation tool) financial management system. Other agents will soon follow Firefly and its cohorts. Still in prototype or getting ready for production are various agents or agent development environments from big league players such as Microsoft, IBM, Enterprise Integration Technologies (now part of Verifone), and Andersen Consulting.",

With an evergrowing wide variety of industrial units and transport vehicles, the hassle of air and sound pollution is becoming severe by every passing day. To achieve this goal, some form of air and sound pollution tracking machine needs to be developed. To counter the hassle of air and sound pollutants tracking, we advocate a Raspberry Pi and IOT primarily based air and sound pollution monitoring machine project. To measure the air and noise pollutants degrees, the monitoring device employs a CO2 sensor, a methane sensor, and a microphone. The measured sensor information is then transmitted to a remote net server through a WI-FI connection. By effective monitoring of pollutants levels, measures may be taken to bring those levels down. Sensor module can analyze and decide the percentage of the toxic gases present in the surroundings and might immediately terminate the output protocol. Fuel sensors are used to acquire records from air and sent to Arduino IDE. The statistics is sent to cloud through Arduino IDE with the help of WI-FI module.

        "Abstract": "Increasingly, industrial robots are being programmed using advanced offline programming tools that can generate collision-free optimised motions. One of the critical requirements for offline programming is an accurately modelled environment. Generating this model can be labour intensive as measurements are manually taken and entered. 3D scanning tools can expedite this process by generating a point cloud that roboticists can use to measure the dimensions of obstacles digitally. Point clouds generated by 3D scanning tools are not well suited to robot motion planning due to their complexity. However, algorithms that generate a simplified model from a point cloud exist and improve collision detection performance. This paper presents an algorithm for converting a point cloud model into an efficient collision model for robot programming. Our algorithm handles noisy data sets and point clouds missing data caused by shadowing. The generated model is a collection of spheres, which performs well in collision detection during motion planning.",

        "Abstract": "Even if clouds are not fit for high-end HPC applications, they could be profitably used to bring the power of economic and scalable parallel computing to the masses. But this requires both simple development environments, able to exploit cloud scalability, and the capability to easily predict the cost of HPC application runs. This paper presents a framework built on the top of a cloud aware programming platform (mOSAIC) for the development of bag-of-tasks scientific applications. The framework integrates a cloud-based simulation environment able to predict the behavior of the developed applications. Simulations enable the developer to predict at an early development stage performance and cloud resource usage, and so the infrastructure lease cost on a public cloud. The paper sketches the framework organization and discusses the approach followed for application development. Moreover, some validation tests of prediction results are presented.",

        "Abstract": "Technical communicators sometimes require dynamic, rich media presentation capability for informational and instructional needs in the workplace, and in technical communication courses originating on the college campus and delivered partially or totally online. Microsoft Producer is a robust, cost-effective, readily mastered and widely available multimedia development tool for delivering dynamic informational presentations and instructional content in online courses. It has fulfilled important roles in informational-instructional delivery in both higher education and the corporate arena. MS Producer provides high fidelity narration and music, graphics, screen capture animations, text, and full motion video, and delivers this using streaming Internet technology. It is especially useful for archiving PowerPoint-based, narrated lectures and for building short, on-demand audiovisual archives of important content elements. MS Producer presentations are SCORM compatible, readily modified and well received by learners. Limitations include severely restricted browser compatibility, streaming media server requirement, and comparatively long download time. Although in wide use, MS Producer appears to have been dropped from further development and is no longer compatible with the current Microsoft Office (2007) suite.",

The real paradigm shift will be the replacement of purchased software packages with transaction-oriented rental of Java applets attached to Web pages. In the move to a full-scale Internet based application development environment, developers are grappling with seven key issues: how to integrate e-mail, FTP, and HTML; the absolute need for security; the dearth of high-end visual tools; configuration management and version control; support for a flexible, sophisticated user interface; a common development environment; and performance, which has several components. Each of these issues are discussed by the author.",

        "Abstract": "As software development becomes an increasingly collaborative effort, traditional development tools have to be extended to support seamless collaboration while minimizing the chances of conflicts. This paper describes Cloud Studio, a collaboration framework that integrates a fine-grained software configuration management model and a real-time awareness system. Cloud Studio's configuration management operates transparently by automatically sharing the changes of developers working on the same project, the real-time awareness system allows for dynamic views on the project selectively including or excluding other developers' changes. With this tight integration, conflicts are prevented in many cases, while leaving individual developers free to experiment without blocking others. The paper also describes a freely available prototype web-based implementation of Cloud Studio and a case study that demonstrates the usability of the approach for collaborative software development.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Compilers tend to produce cryptic and uninformative error messages, leaving programmers confused and requiring them to spend precious time to resolve the underlying error. To find help, programmers often take to online question-and-answer forums such as Stack Overflow to start discussion threads about the errors they encountered.Aims: We conjecture that information from Stack Overflow threads which discuss compiler errors can be automatically collected and repackaged to provide programmers with enhanced compiler error messages, thus saving programmers' time and energy.Method: We present Pycee, a plugin integrated with the popular Sublime Text IDE to provide enhanced compiler error messages for the Python programming language. Pycee automatically queries Stack Overflow to provide customised and summarised information within the IDE. We evaluated two Pycee variants through a think-aloud user study during which 16 programmers completed Python programming tasks while using Pycee.Results: The majority of participants agreed that Pycee was helpful while completing the study tasks. When compared to a baseline relying on the official Python documentation to enhance compiler error messages, participants generally preferred Pycee in terms of helpfulness, citing concrete suggestions for fixes and example code as major benefits.Conclusions: Our results confirm that data from online sources such as Stack Overflow can be successfully used to automatically enhance compiler error messages. Our work opens up venues for future work to further enhance compiler error messages as well as to automatically reuse content from Stack Overflow for other aspects of programming.",

        "Abstract": "The utilization of online learning media at IDE LPKIA is highly recommended by the institution for its lecturers and students to support teaching and learning activities. SDLR is one of the online learning applications implemented at IDE LPKIA. The success of implementing information technology certainly has its measures. One way to measure the level of success in utilizing information technology is by conducting testing on the technology’s acceptance by users. One of the models used to measure the level of technology acceptance is by applying the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT 2) model. The testing was conducted by distributing questionnaires to students, consisting of 42 statements from the total constructs used. The validity and reliability tests were given to 50 respondents. From the results obtained, all statements were deemed valid and reliable, with the obtained p-values showing Fig.s less than 0.05. The sample used consisted of 205 respondents, for hypothesis testing. The results of the testing stated that effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating condition, hedonic motivation, habit, and user satisfaction have a significant influence on behavior intention, and likewise, behavior intention has a significant influence on use behavior. As for the moderation variables, gender and experience less than 3 years have a significant effect on the relationship between hedonic motivation, facilitating condition, and behavior intention. On the other hand, experience exceeding 3 years has an effect on the relationship between habit and behavior intention.",

Here, we describe the different technology types for analyzing Web applications and Web services for security vulnerabilities, along with each type's advantages and disadvantages. At Foundstone, we work with some of the world's biggest banks and telecommunications companies to identify and resolve security issues. Together with our clients, we face challenging testing scenarios in the context of demanding applications and complex business environments. We've seen firsthand what works and what doesn't; what's marketing hype and what gets results. Our analysis here is based on our collective experiences and the lessons we've learned along the way.",

        "Abstract": "In this research, we have developed a web-based Robot Operating System (ROS) learning environment with its own set of tools. Our system is a comprehensive learning environment where students can go through the tutorials using the web interface and use our web-based development environment for writing scripts. Furthermore, students can use the web-based Gazebo simulator to visualize the robots. In addition, our learning environment also has its own set of tools that students can utilize for testing and troubleshooting robots. One of the other benefits of our system is that it is platform independent, and hence it can be accessed from either computer, mobile phone or tablet. Our system also has a dropdown for selecting commands. In this, all the descriptions and syntaxes of the commands are predefined and populated whenever a command is added from the dropdown. In addition, we have developed multiple other features that make this system much easier to use and user-friendly. In order to verify the usability of the system, we have performed a heuristic evaluation, and our findings show that the system complies with nine of the ten heuristics in Nielsen’s framework. In addition, our system complies with twelve of the fourteen heuristics in Zhang’s framework. We performed a performance evaluation as well. In this, we compared the performance of simulating our web-based system against running the same simulation directly from a Linux-based ROS server using the Gazebo client. The results showed that our system was faster by a small margin.",

        "Abstract": "Conventional control systems for machine tools and manufacturing systems are often limited in their computational power, connectivity and interoperability. Cloud-based control systems are a solution that addresses these issues. Advantages of the cloud are the elasticity of computational power (Infrastructure as a Service) and a plethora of development tools (Platform as a Service). The developed solutions are based on a local control system with an additional connection to the cloud. Communication and control of the field level run centralised through this control system. To try for more flexibility, we propose an approach where individual components at the field level are directly connected to the cloud. They are equipped with computational resources, connected directly to a TCP/IP network and communicate with each other and perform control tasks. This had been made possible by ever-shrinking integrated circuits at lower prices. In this paper, a possible use scenario, hardware candidates, and firmware aspects are presented. For an initial examination, the findings were compared against requirements for cloud-based control in the application area of soft-tissue interaction. This proposed architecture will be the basis for a prototype in the future.",

        "Abstract": "The development of GraphQL-based backend services needs: (1) data model, (2) create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations, (3) authentication, and (4) authorization system implementations. There are often repetitions of those implementations in the development process so that a large number of code writings are required. A GraphQL-based backend service development tool for CRUD operations, authentication, and authorization is proposed. This tool was created with the aim of reducing the code writings required for developers to implement CRUD operations, authentication, and authorization systems. GraphQL is used as the query language to access and manipulate data because GraphQL has a schema that can be utilized to define model data and the metadata needed. JSON Web Token (JWT) is chosen as the authentication method because JWT is one of the authentication methods that has a subject context used by the authorization method. Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is used as the authorization method because ABAC can validate up to the attribute level so it can handle many system requirements. The result is a GraphQL-based backend service development tool for CRUD operations, authentication, and authorization called Homura. The following results were obtained: (1) The GraphQL API server was successfully created using Homura based on the definition of CRUD operations, data model, authentication, and authorization, and (2) Homura succeeded in reducing the number of code writings required by 82%.",

The phrase “cloud computing” refers to on-demand internet access to computer resources kept at a remote data center under the administration of a cloud services provider, such as programs, servers (both real and virtual), data storage, development tools, networking capabilities etc. In order to better understand their target audience, automate aspects of their manufacturing process, and develop better goods in response to market demand, organizations utilize machine learning and analytic. All of these elements contribute to a company's enhanced profitability, providing it an advantage over its rivals. The idea of machine learning is founded on the concept of learning from experience. The cloud computing approach can alter the technological infrastructure by incorporating this technology-based idea. An “intelligent cloud” can be built by merging machine learning with cloud computing.",

Collaborative learning and pair programming have demonstrated to have social and learning benefits. However, some of the online programming tools available for children are not designed to allow simultaneous and equitable participation of team members since they allow only for a single control point. In this paper, a preliminary study to cull ideas, insights, and design considerations for a formal programming course for children aged 8-10 using collaborative learning as a pedagogical approach is presented. Three setups were provided: 1) lo-fi prototype, 2) PC, 3) a 46” multi-touch display limited by the application to a single touch entry. Children played a “user” role and provided feedback at the end of the sessions. The feedback provided was mixed, regarding their setup preference, but they all agree to like teamwork.",

In these days, an organization applies multiple software applications to manage its jobs. These applications are also based on several types of platforms. Hence, an interoperability software development using web service becomes one of popular topics in nowadays. In this paper, we emphasized the idea of design and implementation association rule mining web service for a small or medium organization having various software applications on multiple platforms. This service is based on a web service architecture called REST API. The design is intended to be simple. All development tools are also non-commercial software. Therefore, our design in this paper can be easily applied with organization's applications. Our service is tested by using three datasets. According to the result, the processing time depends on the number of transaction in a dataset. From our testing, the service can support a large dataset having 100,000 transactions.",

        "Abstract": "This paper describes a framework for providing multimedia, multimodal, distributed services using the session initiation protocol (SIP) and Web services technologies. Within the framework, there is a service platform consisting of the SIP application server, which is used to build call routing/telephony and IMPP (instant message and presence) services using SIP servlets, and a Web application server. There are also distributed service building blocks providing basic building blocks such as an IVR system, media server, TTS server and conference server. All these building blocks from different vendors can be registered in the UDDI registry for dynamic binding at run time. SOAP is used to transfer control information among different components. Meanwhile, the building blocks can be packaged as deployable units with an SIP interface for establishing IMPP and media sessions and with a SOAP interface for providing dynamic control information. The proposed framework will be beneficial to service developers so that they can use familiar Web development tools instead of proprietary APIs to develop new media applications. It will be also useful for service providers or integrators to easily and quickly deploy new services, which are allowed to be distributed remotely and configured using standard protocols. In addition, the proposed framework will be helpful for end users to access innovative multimedia services, which offer interactions with different features at relatively low cost. It is shown that a number of innovative services could be built using this framework.",

        "Abstract": "This paper describes a service-oriented computing kit (SOCK), which is an overarching framework covering the key artifacts in planning, modeling, designing, developing, deploying, and managing service-oriented solutions in the enterprise computing space. Based on a divide-and-conquer strategy, this comprehensive kit is a systematic taxonomy to abstract complexities and organize the major aspects of service-oriented development, so that the roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, skillsets, procedures and deliverables can be clearly defined for the IT teams to effectively construct service-oriented systems. SOCK comprises eight modules - architecture, process, integration, environment, technology, development, management, and roadmap. Each module addresses specific technical concerns in particular areas. SOA provides the service definitions, service catalog, service composition, scope of applications and portfolios, and service architecture modeling methodology. SOP deals with the business process management, process modeling and notations, process orchestration, coordination/collaborations, human interactions, and 1-phase commit compensation for long-lived processes. SOI concentrates on the service interoperability, integration patterns, enterprise service bus, traditional synchronous/asynchronous enterprise application integration, and integration with portals and content management systems. SOE consists of the runtime infrastructure, service registry for discovery and directory, service transformation/routing gateway, service virtualization via grid computing, and quality-of-services compliance with service-level agreements. SOT covers the implementation technologies - Web services, standards and specifications, technical patterns, convergence, and aspect-oriented techniques. SOD is composed of the development lifecycle, programming model, design/development tools, frameworks, reusable utilities/toolkits/components, and model-driven approaches. SOM includes services & policies repository in service identification and categorization, security mechanisms, business activity monitoring, reporting, BI, and provisioning.

        "Abstract": "The trend in the design of complex instruments is toward distributed control systems implemented with networks of embedded devices. Historically these embedded networks have been implemented using field busses such as CAN, Lon Works, or Profi Net but the ubiquitous nature and low cost of Ethernet has made it the trend in embedded network applications. Ethernet, however, largely depends on DHCP and DNS servers or static IP addressing scheme to enable communication between devices on the network. This paper presents a service-oriented architecture for self-configuring Ethernet-based distributed control systems that is able to adapt to changes in network topology without manual intervention. The three core technologies used to enable self-configuration are all part of Zero Configuration Networking: link-local address auto-configuration for automatic IP address assignment, multicast DNS for automatic hostname resolution, and multicast DNS service discovery for automatic discovery of services. A temperature control system is developed as a case study implementation of the architecture using Java and SOAP web services. Programming web services is simplified using the Java API for XML-Web Services. Programmer productivity is also improved since Java enables the use of enterprise level development tools for debugging and deployment.",

        "Abstract": "Traditionally policy based management systems have relied on 'engineered' policy refinement to decompose high level policies down to low level policies for implementation (Damianou et al., 2002 and Lupu et al., 1999). Such management systems typically rely on a policy designer ensuring that a high level policy creates the necessary invocations or events to trigger the correct low level policies (and their implementation). The difficulty with this approach is that human error in the policy design can lead to feature interaction problems, conflicts and errors (Chomicki et al., 2003 and Lupu and Sloman, 1999). This refinement problem is a key challenge for policy based management to be adopted widely within service management (voted #1 key challenge at Policy 2005 panel session). In this paper we concentrate on policy based management of Web services, where the Web services have adaptive behaviors. The paper proposes the design, implementation and evaluation of a suite of policy development tools which (i) facilitate the specification of adaptive Web services (which are to be managed by a policy based system) using finite state machines to describe the permitted adaptive behaviors, (ii) supports the specification of supportable (functionally correct) high level management policies, the automated refinement of these high level policies and the auto-generation of enforceable (low level) policies. The paper also presents an evaluation of the systems with particular reference to the usability of the proposed solution. The paper also provides a brief presentation of related research in policy refinement and distinguishes the proposed approach from published work. Finally the paper concludes by drawing initial findings and identifies future work.",

        "Abstract": "Through a recent project for the FAA Academy, an ATC Scenario Training Technology (ASTT) is being developed at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University to provide the Academy students with an online tool to practice various En Route scenarios specified by the FAA. Our proposed ATC Scenario Training Technology (ASTT) is currently being developed as a Web-based ERAM training tool, designed to provide a recreation of the ERAM's core functionality with the ability to load/create/modify scenarios. The tool will allow for students to select an instructor-provided scenario and switch between the R-Side and EDST contexts in real time. The challenges of designing such a system are mainly constrained to the team development environment, interface design, scenario simulation, and user response processing domains, but the overall architecture needs to be considered closely. This paper reports on the challenges in designing and developing the underlying ASTT software technology as a computationally intensive and multifaceted system, specifically in the domains of the technology stack selection and development environment creation. ASTT prototype architecture (both front-end and back-end) will also be presented and discussed. In addition, the proposed architecture for project execution will be addressed.",

        "Abstract": "For the purpose of implementing integrative and accurate service of modern agriculture, Intelligent Agricultural Meteorological App that is used to solve the problem of the last one-kilometer in agrometeorological services. Based on the meteorological data and models, the Intelligent agricultural meteorological mobile phone client is designed in a hierarchical and modular way to realize the development of “home page”, “map service”, “service module”, “about” and other display function modules. The background is developed in C# language, which is responsible for date collection, processing and distribution. The foreground client reads the data of each element through WebService interface, provides services with the network map function, and displays it with the web technology combined with the native IOS and Android nested web pages. The Android framework is developed in Java language based on JDK, Android Development Tools and Eclipse platform; The IOS framework is developed in Object-C language under Mac operating system, based on IOS SDK and x-code platform. The overall framework of the background data process of the Intelligent Agricultural Meteorological App platform is developed in C# language on visual studio 2013 software platform, which includes data collection system, data processing system, data release system, map service system, real-time release system. These systems are described as follow:(1) Data collection system collects meteorological products and data from different data sources. The received data are standardized by the system, such as unpacking, decoding, file name verification, etc. the processed data and products are synchronized to the data processing server for processing in real time, and uploaded to the file server for backup and storage. (2) Data processing system processes the meteorological data collected by the data collection system in real time according to the specifications of different products, and synchronizes the data to the map processing server and data publishing server. (3) Map service system is based on arcgis10.2, which can release meteorological data into dynamic map service layer and map attribute interface. After data interpolation and color filling, it can return the graphical data products based on geographic information conveniently and quickly. (4) Data publishing system publishes the preprocessed data into a web service that can be called by the front desk in real time. As the front-end real-time publishing system uses HTML 5 and JavaScript framework, the data interface is uniformly encapsulated as JSNOP format in order to facilitate cross domain access, the URL service of the server is called through AJAX, and the real-time data such as forecast points and future weather are obtained by parsing the returned callbackFunction object. (5) As the front-end of the whole intelligent Agrometeorological system, the real-time release system includes multiple functional modules such as real time weather, weather forecast, agricultural disaster early warning, agricultural weather forecast, map service, etc. Now the App had been applicate in agrometeorological services, which has a very important practical significance role in improving the quality of ago-meteorological service, providing directing agricultural services and avoiding and reducing agrometeorological disasters.

The conceptual model plays an important part in the development process. Considering that no model can be exploited to its maximum potential unless it is supported by a proper set of development tools, in this paper we present MODE, a tool for conceptual modeling of Web applications based on UWA methodology and on the related HDM2000 model. In MODE the designer can work simultaneously at different levels and on different parts of the design in accordance with UWA methodology. After a first off-line version of MODE based on Microsoft Visio a second it is available a new on-line editor based on Microsoft .Net framework. Both these versions allow the production of well-organized design documents using the Microsoft office automation features. In particular the on-line version, introduced in this paper, open new ways to the cooperative design. According to Rational Rose that has demonstrated the benefits derived from the adoption of a design tools with prototyping features, MODE can be used in conjunction with WARP, a fast prototyping system for Web applications. A real life experience of the use of the methodology and of the MODE are reported.",

        "Abstract": "LabVIEW is a development environment from National Instruments, focused on the automation of processing and measuring equipment, and it is and has been for years a crucial tool in Educational Remote Laboratories. Three features are key for this success: a) a visual programming language called G, so developers don't need to work with traditional “text” programming languages, therefore achieving a wider range of experiment developers; b) a strong industrial support and c) the “Remote Panels”, where the developer publishes the application automatically in a web browser. However, Remote Panels require a plug-in to run, not available for mobile devices neither all browsers in operating systems, and it clearly breaks with the ongoing web development trends, more interested in HTML5. This contribution shows how LabVIEW Remote Panels are used in Remote Laboratories, describing its inclusion in the WebLab-Deusto platform, and it describes the advantages and disadvantages of its use, comparing it with other existing approaches.",

        "Abstract": "Transformer is a pivotal equipment in the power system, and its safe and stable operation affects the entire power system. Therefore, the on-line monitoring and fault diagnosis of transformers are particularly important in practical applications. The traditional maintenance method is called regular maintenance. This maintenance method is to call a large number of inspection workers at regular intervals to carry out large-scale inspections, not only to collect various working data of the transformer, but also to observe its working status, and finally manually. Check whether there are hidden dangers in major machines, and judge whether the transformer can run safely and stably according to the data obtained by these large amounts of manpower and material resources. In order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of transformer fault diagnosis, and to carry out all-round real-time online monitoring and fault diagnosis of 220kV power transformers, considering the actual needs of electricity companies, this paper is based on the Qt development platform, C++, MySQL and other development environments. And developed a transformer online monitoring and intelligent diagnosis system, which mainly has the functions of providing basic information management, online monitoring, fault diagnosis, giving operation and maintenance suggestions, and providing users with visual comprehensive analysis. Tested with actual data, it is proved that the system can objectively reflect the operating state of the transformer and carry out real-time fault diagnosis. The system designed in this paper meets the needs of operators to understand the status of distribution transformers, and effectively solves the problem of untimely detection of distribution transformer faults. It can effectively improve the efficiency of detection, reduce the probability of major accidents, and reduce operation and maintenance costs., which saves financial and human resources, and is of great significance for improving economic efficiency and personal and equipment safety.",

The PaaS is hosted by a cloud of dinam-mite nodes which facilitates the on-demand development, deployment and integration of WSN applications. We introduce the dinam Cloud architecture and focus, in this paper, on the PaaS layer established by the dinam-mite nodes. In addition to the description of this so-called dinam PaaS, a performance analysis of the dinam-mite node towards its applicability to forming a dinam PaaS layer is demonstrated. We then present the MASON mobile vehicular network as an example of such a WSN which delivers spatially and temporally fine-grained environmental measurements within the city of Beijing, and illustrate how to utilize the dinam PaaS for integrating the data from the MASON network into its back-end business system. Finally, we discuss the five essential properties of the Cloud Computing stack, according to the NIST definition, with respect to the dinam PaaS and illustrate the benefits of the dinam PaaS for system integration as well as WSN application development.",

Field knowledge provided by the farmer and theoretical knowledge lack a useful articulation for decision making and the generation of adaptation strategies. Therefore, in our work we created a technological tool, hosted on a web page with the objective of linking knowledge. In the application we incorporate a classical biochemical model that qualitatively represents the vegetative and floral growth of plants. In this paper, we describe in detail the modeling techniques and also report the implementation of the model in the R programming environment and in Shiny (an R package for creating interactive web applications). Thus, we present a new tool, available as an R package and as a web application, that facilitates the nonlinear analysis of plant growth phenomena, provides an ideal environment for generating multidisciplinary dialogues, and allows the creation of quantitative indicators for agricultural production.",

This study aims to design a web-based real time monitoring system for electrical energy consumption inside a particular house. The sensing peripheral node was constructed using an ESP8266 controller chipset to steer a relay and a current sensor PZEM004T. The controller was programmed using the Arduino IDE application and exploiting the powerful performance of C language to build the codes. The web-based application interface was correspondingly created using the sublime text 3text editor using the HTML; CSS programming languages as the frontend; and both PHP and MySQL software as the backend. Users could control the functional of the particular installed electronic devices using ON / OFF button directly through the designed website. Through this way, users may also observe the current and power values consumed by each operated devices. The cumulative power consumption profile for a certain time interval for each electronic appliances is also graphically visualized on the website menu. The practical testing results obtained the percentage of error current reading from the PZEM-004T sensor to the theoretical current value. From the data collection of an electric loads, the error percentage of the light bulb load is 0.5%, the rice cooker load is 0.7% and the dispenser load is 0.1%.",

The main idea of this project is to make a smart irrigation system that updates live data using Internet of Things(IoT) technology. IoT technology helps to retrieve data from the sensors such as Temperature, Humidity, Soil Moisture. All these sensor values will be accessible to the farmer through a web application. This web application helps farmers better understand the requirement of water content in the soil which will eventually help in better irrigation followed by better crop production. The web application comprises three display sections, each displaying temperature, moisture & humidity values, and a manual button has been included for scenarios when there is an abundance of water due to rainfall. In such cases, alerts will be generated and the farmer can dig a way for excess water removal. The temperature sensor values are further processed for filtering out the noise by performing the Kalman Filter technique using Processing IDE application by Arduino. After filtering the noise we get smooth values and these threshold values are passed into a decision tree algorithm which, based on its rules, decides whether the water pump should be switched on or off.",

        "Abstract": "Infrastructure resources on-demand requires resource provision (e.g., CPU and memory) to be both sufficient and necessary, which is the most important issue and a challenge in Cloud Computing. Platform as a service (PaaS) encapsulates a layer of software that includes middleware, and even development environment, and provides them as a service for building and deploying cloud applications. In PaaS, the issue of on-demand infrastructure resource management becomes more challenging due to the thousands of cloud applications that share and compete for resources simultaneously. The fundamental solution is to integrate and coordinate the resource consumption and allocation management of a cloud application. The difficulties of such a solution in PaaS are essentially how to maximize the resource utilization of an application, and how to allocate resources to guarantee adequate resource provision for the system. In this paper, we propose an approach to managing infrastructure resources in PaaS by leveraging two adaptive control loops: the resource consumption optimization loop and the resource allocation loop. The optimization loop improves the resource utilization of a cloud application via management functions provided by the corresponding middleware layers of PaaS. The allocation loop provides or reclaims appropriate amounts of resources to/from the application system while guaranteeing its performance. The two loops are integrated to run consecutively and repeatedly to provide infrastructure resources on-demand by first trying to improve resource utilization, and then allocating more resources when necessary. We implement a framework, SmartRod, to investigate our approach. The experiment on SmartRod proves its effectiveness on infrastructure resource management.",

        "Abstract": "The comprehension of algorithms is becoming essential and programming, not rarely, has being introduced since elementary school. Nevertheless, the acquisition of programming skills is not an easy task. This fact is corroborated by the literature that report alarming failure and dropout rates in CS0 (Introduction to Computer Science) courses. On the other hand, forecasts about the demand for software developers indicate exponential growth over the next decade.In this context, reducing the cognitive workload for learners is desirable. For instance, the integration of a web-based environment with some visual programming tool and automatic assessment could benefit learners.The adoption of a unique environment where the students could learn how to solve problems using algorithms and receive immediate feedback may reduce the slope of the learning curve. Moreover, the possibility of using the same tool to communicate with their teachers and colleagues can positively affect their learning.Also, the visual programming paradigm can reduce the need for memorization of a programming language syntax. It allows learners to focus their attention on solving the problem algorithmically.There are several tools that provide automated assessment evaluation. Some of these can be used with Web browsers, but very few of them can be integrated with a Learning Management System (LMS). In this workshop, we will discuss two of these systems that are distributed as free software: the Virtual Programming Laboratory (VPL) and the iVProgH/iAssign solutions. They can all be integrated with the Moodle platform.Since VPL demands an extra installation of the jail server (to run students solutions) and works with traditional programming languages, the focus will be over iVProgH/iAssign. The iVProgH/iAssign solution implements the Visual Programming Paradigm. iVProgH is implemented in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, sparing the use of a security environment to separated compilation, as VPL demands.",

Portfolios represent an interesting blend of creativity and development techniques. Graphic designers blend great design practices and good coding techniques in order to provide an aesthetically pleasing usable web portfolio. In trying to impress possible employers graphic designers are in some cases more concerned with showing off their expertise rather than focusing on the user experience. The article explores the correlation between visual interests and computer competences of the user with the quality of experience of the particular website. The research is based on a subjective survey research of users and discusses the results of what type of portfolio web site's conceptual model/programming tool is more suitable with regard to user's interest and competences. It was shown more competent users are generally more critical about the quality of experience, and value pragmatic over hedonic quality of the product.",

        "Abstract": "In order to integrate distributed and isomerous earth system scientific data resources and provide one stop data sharing services for different users, a distributed data sharing platform is needed urgently in China. In this paper, we analyze interoperability requirements of the distributed earth system scientific data sharing platform (ESSDSP) in the first place. Then the general framework of the platform based on service-oriented architecture (SOA) is designed. This platform comprises one main center, one authentication center and several sub-centers in which core functions are encapsulated into Web services. Through this incompact architecture, it can not only implement the interoperability among distributed data centers, but also easily integrate other software systems. Furthermore, these Web services can be accessed by third party software such as e-business, e-government and so on to achieve data sharing function. Finally we introduce the design, implementation and deployment of some core Web services in detail, i.e. data centers' information synchronization service, distributed metadata synchronization management service and multi-resource data access service. This platform was deployed in Earth System Scientific Data Sharing Network(ESSDSN), one of National Infrastructure and Facility Development Environment Building for Science and Technology Industries Program of China. In practice, it comprises one main center, one authentication center and 13 sub-centers. So far, it has integrated 10.23 T Byte data resources and 17 T Byte data resources have been downloaded by 34,597 users.",

        "Abstract": "Transformation of technologies to operate in Internet of Things (IoT) will increase their connectivity for sharing and collecting data with minimal human intervention, as well as to use advantages of cloud computing. The paper presents a novel approach for integrating EEG brain computer interface (BCI) with a humanoid robot for communications in the IoT. A transformation of both devices into IoT things allow seamless communication for data exchange with other IoT devices or services and more efficient computations in the web or cloud. Node-RED is the chosen programming tool providing a gateway to IoT, by which the EEG-based Emotiv EPOC+BCI device and the humanoid robot Pepper communicate. There is a library of input nodes in Node-RED for EPOC+ device, by which it interfaces services and devices in Internet, however such nodes do not exists for Pepper. Two approaches for transformation of the robot into IoT device have been designed and tested. In the first, MQTT protocol has been deployed on the robot side that can use local or remote MQTT broker. In the second approach, there is no need to install specific publish-subscribe client software for interactions with the broker. Instead, continuous python process in Node-RED accesses the Pepper internal memory for storing and retrieving key-value pairs. The devices share and collect data based on publish-subscribe model embedded in Node-RED. Original flows were designed and developed for BCI control of the robot in the IoT. The control is based on EEG data featuring, classifying and translating into machine commands that interface the robot APIs from Node-RED.",

Development architectures of single database servers are replaced by message based exchange servers, cross application handling emerged, business demands change more rapidly and Web portals, Web services etc. require not only new tools to manage software maintenance, but also preventive maintenance tools as customer implementations extend. Those are complex with respect to the number of installations and also challenging in terms of users. A well designed product innovation lifecycle delivers already higher software quality upfront. SAP NetWeaver and the business process platform provide the base for reuse and composite architecture. Only combining preventive maintenance tools with the solution management process will support a lower total cost of ownership. Organizing this around 10,000 and plus developers distributed around the globe represents an additional challenge. The scope of the presentation is thus to outline these requirements within the context of SAP Labs development network including new upcoming challenges.",

        "Abstract": "Education informatization is an important part of national informatization and an important symbol of educational modernization. At present, the country is vigorously investing in the construction of college education informatization, and has made gratifying achievements in informatization infrastructure construction, resource construction, standardization construction and application of information technology, but there are also some problems. The purpose of this paper is to study the construction of the optimization system of college informatization assessment structure based on Web GIS algorithm. By combining the analysis of Super Map system structure and characteristics, Web GIS technology system, environmental monitoring technology and other characteristics, taking Super Map as the development environment, this paper mainly studies the specific application of Web GIS information assessment system. Combined with UML modeling technology, the relevant functions and data structures of the information assessment platform are designed and analyzed, and the design and implementation of the current information assessment platform are finally completed. Experiments have proved that the information-based assessment of structure optimization in this paper can greatly save the time of each link of the assessment, among which dozens of hours can be reduced for test paper review and test paper analysis, and the satisfaction of teachers and students for structure optimization has reached more than 90%.",

        "Abstract": "The MapReduce (MR) framework is a programming environment that facilitates rapid parallel design of applications that process big data. While born in the Cloud arena, numerous other areas are now attempting to utilize it for their big data due to the speed of development. However, for HPC researchers and many others who already utilize centralized storage, MR marks a paradigm shift toward co-located storage and computation resources. In this work I attempt to reach the best of both worlds by exploring how to utilize MR on a network-attached parallel file system. This work is nearly complete and has unearthed key issues I've subsequently overcome to achieved desired high throughput. In my poster I describe many of these issues, demonstrate improvements possible with different architectural schemas, and provide reliability and fault-tolerance considerations for this novel combination of Cloud computation and HPC storage.",

Resource Allocation is one of the most challenging tasks in cloud since it depends on dynamicity of resource providers and heterogeneous user request. To efficiently allocate the user request in a resource, Efficient Resource Allocation (ERA) is proposed. Hence, in the proposed efficient resource allocation mechanism, Job Centric Cosine Similarity based K-Means ( JCC K-Means) is used to cluster the resources dynamically based on user request and improved branch and bound based assignment algorithm is used for efficient allocation of cloud resources to user request. The proposed work is simulated and compared with K-means and Random Allocation. The simulation is carried out in Java using Eclipse IDE The simulation results shows that the proposed work achieves better result in terms of efficient resource discovery, makespan and user satisfaction.",

        "Abstract": "Cloud Computing is a concept for virtualized resources. It is a technology which delivers plenty of services to service users through internet. It takes users request as input and delivers the service in good manner. Cloud computing manages the numerous variety of virtualized resources and user request which makes scheduling an important one in order to manage it effectively. For every task thousands of virtualized assets are used. Task scheduling in cloud computing is the process of organizing the user task and allocating it with the suitable and available resources so that the available resources will be properly used and scheduling will be done effectively. There are numerous task scheduling techniques. This paper presents an alternative approach to task scheduling problem. It mainly focused on the time utilization and resource monitoring. The proposed method is Enhanced Resource Monitor and Scheduler (ERMS) which focus on both monitoring of available resources and scheduling of user task.Periodic push action method is used to get the status of virtual machine. The fitness value is calculated and scheduling is done. The process is implemented using ClouldSim 3.0 Simulator in NetBeans IDE.",

The idea is to enrich business description languages with a few extra details on task assignment, semantics, and typed dataflows, so as to enable a two-step generative approach: first the Process Model is automatically transformed into an Application Model, which seamlessly express both human- and machine-executable tasks; secondly, the Application Model is fed to a state-of-the-practice Web/Web Service development tool capable of producing the code. The resulting method and generative framework unify Web Service orchestration and Web User Interface design into a coherent Model-Driven Engineering process.",

To improve the hands-on experiences of HPC learners, we design and implement a flexible and adaptive online HPC learning platform in this paper, called EasyHPC. This platform contains various online course modules such as quiz bank, interactive community, and virtual laboratory. In our system, various HPC theoretical and experimental learning activities can be conducted online, such as assigning HPC parallel programming tasks, and creating HPC questions and collecting students' submissions. It is convenient for students to study HPC-related courses in our platform, submit course assignments, exchange ideas, and complete HPC programming tasks. Our preliminary learning trials have shown that our system can effectively improve the hands-on experience of our students by providing an integrated HPC learning and programming environment. Our students are able to achieve various HPC capstone projects in our platform to develop their system capability.",

Most existing systems store data in specialized databases with built-in concurrency control policies, usually implemented via locking. It is desirable to construct such collaborative systems on top of the World Wide Web, but most Web servers do not support even conventional transactions, let alone distributed (multi-Website) transactions or flexible concurrency control mechanisms oriented toward team work-such as event notification, shared locks, and fine granularity locks. We present a transaction server that operates independently of Web servers or the collaborative systems, to fill the concurrency control gap. By default, the transaction server enforces the conventional atomic transaction model, where sets of operations are performed in an all-or-nothing fashion and isolated from concurrent users. The server can be tailored dynamically to apply more sophisticated concurrency control policies appropriate for collaboration. The transaction server also supports applications employing information resources other than Web servers, such as legacy databases, CORBA objects, and other hypermedia systems. Our implementation permits a wide range of system architecture styles.",

        "Abstract": "Software development is tightly dependent on the tools available for supporting its processes. Organizational and sociotechnical peculiarities such as indefinition of roles, geographically distributed development teams, new business models and diverse cultural interactions steer these tools. Software development supported by web-based services, built on top of Web 2.0 technologies, is emerging as a new paradigm for distributed software development. New generation software forges (web-based development environments) such as EzForge are becoming the infrastructure that provides the required features for hosting collections of software development projects. They are composed of an integrated set of tools, interacting in a mashup-like environment, each one suited for a specific task, and therefore simple enough to keep total complexity low. An adequate selection of tools helps developers to focus on the implementation of the requirements, while at the same time they cope with complex information coming from many individuals and organizations. The complexity of distributed software development requires a controlled and a strong collaboration amongst developers, which has to be supported by the selected architecture. Moreover, an increased demand on quality assurance is required by the many organizations aiming to achieve a certain quality level. A new architecture based on the Web 2.0 core ideas and methods overcomes these challenges in software development, representing a cornerstone to achieve satisfactory results in this ambitious environment.",

This kind of testing assumes a lot of computational resources provided by a regression test center. The interaction with the test center is done through Web services implemented by the new developed Unit Test Center Grid Web Service (UTCGWS). UTCGWS is the interface to the developer IDEs and does compiling, deploying, distributing regression test and information managing.

        "Abstract": "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) plays a significant role for the modern software development. However, most students find it difficult to learn the OOP concepts well because they are usually abstract and hard to image. Therefore, the pressing issue is how to efficiently facilitate the OOP learning. The graphical programming tools have been proven to benefit the concepts learning of Structured Programming, e.g., Scratch and Blockly. Accordingly, in this study, a Web-based Visualized OOP Learning Tool (VLT-OOP), is designed and developed to facilitate the OOP concepts learning. VLT-OOP visualizes the important and abstract concepts of OOP, i.e., Class, Object, Method, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism, to assist students in visually understanding the meaning through the developments of 2D graphical Web-based applications using the visualized objects and operations. Accordingly, the motivation and performance of OOP learning will be expected to outperform the traditional text-based programming approach.",

It provides an open standard interface among the heterogeneous computers on the Internet. To exploit the enormous computational resources on the Internet, we have developed a Java-based parallel programming environment called Java Message Passing Interface (JMPI). It runs on different machines regardless of their computer architecture or operating systems. It uses arbitrary machines on the Internet as computation nodes, and provides an application programming interface which follows the semantic of Message Passing Interface standard. In this paper, we present the overview of the infrastructure of this parallel programming environment.",

        "Abstract": "Urdu language written in English alphabets for communication is known as Roman Urdu. In pronunciation, both are the same but different in spelling and have different shapes of the alphabet. A survey acknowledges that 300 million people are speaking Urdu and about 11 million speakers in Pakistan from which maximum users prefer Roman Urdu for the textual communication. Today most of the modern technologies like computers and mobile phones using English script, due to this local Urdu user has to use English letters to type Urdu script that is Roman Urdu. In this research, Roman Urdu to Urdu Translator (RUTUT) is proposed that consists of preprocessing methods, rule-based character substitution and Unicode based character mapping techniques. It can transliterate the messages or descriptions from the Roman Urdu script to Urdu script which may help the Urdu speaker to elaborate their message in efficient manners. The focus of this research is to analyze the issues related to the Roman Urdu script to Urdu script transliteration and develop a translator based on the concepts of transliteration. This research analyzed Roman Urdu data and identified different rules-based character substitution techniques that transform the Roman Urdu into Urdu script at fundamental levels. This research is carried out using a python programming language in programming tool Anaconda in Jupiter notebook and user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) created by using Tkinter library. To evaluate the RUTUT, different translational tests are performed and compare those results with famous Google online translator and ijunoon online transliteration. The analyses of results show that the proposed RUTUT approach translates accurately than Google online translator and ijunoon online transliteration.",

Deploying CNNs solely on CPU-GPU based platforms deal with issues of high power consumption and comparatively slower processing speeds than hardware accelerators like FPGA. FPGA offers high parallel-processing capability, hardware re-configurability, reduced latency and low power consumption. To further improve flexibility in programming the hardware accelerator, we decided to use High Level Synthesis (HLS) tool based on OpenCL framework for development of our CNN model and implementing it on cloud. We are using Xilinx SDAccel development environment targeting Amazon’s AWS EC2 F1 instances. We are using Cloud based services for our model visualization on FPGAs. Cloud provides FPGA as a service with High Performance Computing (HPC) resources and enables us to deploy our optimized code on provided FPGA accelerated instance without need of buying an actual hardware. AWS EC2 F1 instance uses Xilinx Ultrascale+VU9P chip as a Hardware platform.",

        "Abstract": "We report an empirical study of nonprogrammers' mental models regarding particular concerns in web application development such as input validation, database lookup, and overview-detail relationships. The goal of the study was to understand how nonprogrammers think about the data and logic underlying a web application. In continuing work, we are using this understanding as a basis for the design of tools and development resources that are intuitive and easy to use. The current paper describes the empirical work that was done and discusses its implications for the design of end-user web development tools that could be used to develop web applications of intermediate complexity.",

        "Abstract": "Software companies have an interest in reaching the maximum amount of potential customers while, at the same time, providing a frictionless experience. Desktop web app frameworks are promising in this respect, allowing developers and companies to reuse existing code and knowledge of web applications to create cross-platform apps integrated with native APIs. Despite their growing popularity, existing challenges in employing these technologies have not been documented, and it is hard for individuals and companies to weigh benefits and pros against drawbacks and cons.In this paper, we address this issue by investigating the challenges that developers frequently experience when adopting desktop web app frameworks. To achieve this goal, we mine and apply topic modeling techniques to a dataset of 10,822 Stack Overflow posts related to the development of desktop web applications. Analyzing the resulting topics, we found that: i) developers often experience issues regarding the build and deployment processes for multiple platforms; ii) reusing existing libraries and development tools in the context of desktop applications is often cumbersome; iii) it is hard to solve issues that arise when interacting with native APIs. Furthermore, we confirm our finding by providing evidence that the identified issues are also present in the issue reports of 453 open-source applications publicly hosted on GitHub.",

        "Abstract": "Many standards and guidelines have been proposed over the years to help web developers produce accessible content. Being designed to be suitable for application to the widest possible number of web technologies, such guidelines are often perceived as hard to understand, not suitable for practical problem solving, and under some circumstances even not really useful in order to develop an accessible website or application.As a consequence, many accompanying resources have been proposed to support developers in understanding accessibility guidelines and applying them to their projects, as well as a variety of testing tools to let them check the presence of accessibility issues in their code and provide guidance in fixing them. Yet, most web content available on the Inter.net still exhibit critical accessibility issues.In our opinion, this approach is non satisfactory, as the personal understanding of the developers is always mediated by written reports and indirect information that are not immediately understandable and actionable. In this paper we propose our approach to increase integration between development tools and accessibility testing tools in usual web development workflows. In particular they should be capable of mapping accessibility related concepts onto familiar and immediately perceivable information, so that developers can immediately pin ìssues and plan for solving them without lengthy and wordy reports.",

A conceptual approach to its solution is offered based on an analysis of the peculiarities of the construction of web applications. Our approach is based on defining the standard web application architecture and selecting its components using formal methods in accordance with user requirements. A formal logical system is proposed that uses the design of web applications as a process of outputting a formula specified according to the needs of the user, which defines the schemes of execution of the modules of the system. An important feature of this approach is the ability to visualise the process of designing the system in 3D, which creates the conditions for effective interaction between developers and machine development tools.",

They allow the author to voice their own opinion or ideas, and have the potential to reach a massive audience via the Web. On the other hand, e-portfolios are gaining recognition as a personal learning and development tool, where users can learn through reflection, and are able to showcase their work to demonstrate skills, competencies and capabilities. This paper presents an e-learning system that couples a blog with a learning e-portfolio. The system is called dotFOLIO and is currently being trialled in a first year engineering course taught at the University of Sydney. An evaluation of the system was conducted through a survey to gather the students' initial perceptions of reflective learning and of using dotFOLIO for a learning activity that was previously paper-based. Preliminary results of this survey are presented",

        "Abstract": "This Innovative Practice Category Work-In-Progress paper describes the innovative way in which a course on hardware/software codesign was conducted fully online during a near-lockdown necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. A novel remote lab setup was established in a very limited time, which was used to ensure that students were able to achieve hands-on experience through a project in spite of the course being taught fully online. Students could run the development environment on their own computers and needed to access the online lab setup only for running their program on the actual hardware, which was connected to a light server with the serial and programming ports forwarded over the internet. Lab exercises were modified appropriately to fit the constraints imposed by the remote setup while not compromising on the rigor and desirable course learning outcomes. A wiki-based platform was used for the dissemination of information, scaffolding, collaboration, as well as booking of slots to access the remote lab setup. Zoom video conferencing tool was used for consultations as well as evaluations. The results are encouraging, with students satisfied with the experience gained, without having to compromise on practical knowledge. This opens up the potential to implement such remote lab-based hands-on projects in MOOCs and continuing education scenarios to enhance student learning.",

        "Abstract": "Pair programming has been shown to be a beneficial and popular technique for engaging students and improving learning outcomes in programming and related classes. While using pair programming in a collocated classroom setting is relatively straightforward, there is a strong lack of good tools and options for distributed classroom settings. The growth of such classes, from small structured seminars to massive open online courses (MOOCs), and the isolation and impoverished learning experience some students report in these, points to an urgent need for tools that support remote pair programming in a distributed educational setting. This paper explores the requirements and needs of online learners in Computer Science through a literature survey. To validate these requirements, we implement a collaborative development environment aimed at improving the learning experience through pair programming and a tights code-artifact feedback loop. We conclude by presenting the results of a user study in both collocated and distributed classroom settings.",

It uses a global web-based framework and Java for development tool for the establishment of system. Data compilation procedure, with the help of the pro system case-based deduction technique, provided the system with an automatic analytical capacity, thereby further enhancing the capacity of the web-based intelligent RMA repair and maintenance system. The system allowed an interaction with the customers. The intelligent RMA system allowed us to improve repair and maintenance efficiency by 26%, strongly boosting degree of customer satisfaction. Moreover, the global inventory management can reduce 12%; a boon that not only reduced the interest payments for inventory, but also eased up the company revolving fund cycle. The system can institute a more flexible part supply system, as well as enabled the Quality Assurance (QA) and R&D departments to understand the trouble-causing factors of the products that the company has sold. As a result, product AFR (Annual Failure Rate) dropped by around 85% Finally, we also used the repair and maintenance information to train new engineers. It saved us training time. Hence, the research has designed an innovative and practical IT (CRM) system.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, advances in IT technology affects a plethora of sectors such as environmental monitoring and management. Open source web map based Geographic Information Systems (GIS) offer a significant advantage in monitoring and representation for many environmental parameters. Here a WebGIS platform based on OpenLayers is presented that displays a set of environmental parameters using novel techniques such as schematic-color methods and 2D arrays. OpenLayers is an open source web maps development tool for WebGIS client that it is characterized by small size and powerful functionality compared with commercial WebGIS software. The data is derived from a set of environmental stations that have been placed in 2 case study areas, in the Port of Igoumenitsa (Greece). The stations transmit data using MQTT protocol that provides convenience and security in data communication. The data is displayed on the platform via a heatmap and color schemes as well as through a 2D array and it can provide both historical and future data. It is noted that the proposed platform is adaptable to making modifications and expansions such as adding new environmental variables for viewing or adding new stations and case study areas by using configuration files that requires minimal programmable skills.",

        "Abstract": "The proposed venture will include an analysis of the key decisions and challenges encountered along the way, as well as lessons learned and potential directions for future development. The objective of this project is to build a real-world, scalable, online car reservation system that makes use of the whole MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) stack. Business transactions will be simplified and improved by implementing the suggested MERN stack automobile rental management system. The development system will enable users to efficiently manage transactions, scheduling, and automobile inventory in the car rental sector. The article introduces a peer-to-peer vehicle webservice without the need for a centralized power, allowing in cheaper rates and more open sharing of information in the system. This is the key unique aspect of the paper. In addition to the physical application and associated development environment that created the working MVP, this paper also analyses prospective improvements that, when coupled with the practical application, could serve as the foundation for the project's further phases. In many countries, renting a car is increasingly becoming the most popular form of mobility, particularly among employees and students. Users who are accustomed to sophisticated technology benefit from this convenience. The workflow and types of resources retained in the car rental industry are two areas where many revolutions have switched from traditional to online systems. Clients will be able to make reservations for their cars from everywhere in the world thanks to the Car Rental System. For the purpose of submitting information to this application, users fill out their personal information. A customer who registers on the website will have access to booking a vehicle. The suggested system is an online platform that is entirely integrated. It effectively and successfully automates manual procedures. Customers can fill up the details based on their needs thanks to this automated approach. It contains information on the location and the kind of car they want to rent. The goal of this system is to create a website where customers may reserve automobiles and make service requests from anywhere in the world.",

        "Abstract": "This paper describes how we extended a module structure of the Smalltalk LearningWorks framework to provide a programming environment designed for very large scale technology transfer. The 'module' is what we have termed the LearningBook, a set of classes and persistent objects, including an HTML browser, programming and visualization tools, and microworlds. The context for this development is a distance learning university course in object technology which is enrolling over 5000 mature students per year-making it the largest such course in the world. While promoting a systems building approach, we have successfully added support for programming in the small and the needs of the isolated novice. Two guiding principles have been: (i) the environment and its modules fit into a consistent structure for personal management of learning and (ii) details of complex facilities, such as the class library, are progressively disclosed as knowledge and sophistication grow. The paper shows how these principles have guided the exploitation of LearningBook modules. To provide context, relevant academic background is given. Early informal feedback is reported and a project currently underway to observe in detail how thousands of learners use the programming environment is sketched.",

        "Abstract": "Augmented Reality or AR is a technology characterized by virtual content adding on the perception of reality using the existing environment and overlaying additional information, this digital information is shown in a device display in real time. The aim of this study is to implement some tests for a mobile augmented reality system (MAR) and test the potential of AR development tools in a mobile application for a surgery training system to assist and train laparoscopic or minimal invasive surgery. These tests are the base for the first application to be developed, it will use 3D visualization, depth extraction from medical images and tracking to display information about the video surgery. Augmented reality apps are written in special 3D programs that allow the developer to tie animation or contextual digital information in a computer program to an augmented reality “marker” in the real world. When a computing device AR app or browser plug-in receives digital information from a known marker, it begins to execute the marker's code and layer the correct image or images.",

        "Abstract": "The feature list of modern IDEs is steadily growing and mastering these tools becomes more and more demanding, especially for novice programmers. Despite their remarkable capabilities, IDEs often still cannot directly answer the questions that arise during program comprehension tasks. Instead developers have to map their questions to multiple concrete queries that can be answered only by combining several tools and examining the output of each of them manually to distill an appropriate answer. Existing approaches have in common that they are either limited to a set of predefined, hardcoded questions, or that they require to learn a specific query language only suitable for that limited purpose. We present a framework to query for information about a software system using guided-input natural language resembling plain English. For that, we model data extracted by classical software analysis tools with an OWL ontology and use knowledge processing technologies from the Semantic Web to query it. We use a case study to demonstrate how our framework can be used to answer queries about static source code information for program comprehension purposes.",

        "Abstract": "Nowadays, pollution is remaining as a major issue of concern. Air pollution is basically a mixture of various dangerous particles and toxic gases in the environment. The release of suspended particles, hazardous gases, dust pollutants cause depletion of ozone layer. In this paper, various sensors are used to identify carbon dioxide gas present in the air, humidity, environment temperature, and atmospheric pressure. Raspberry pi 3 and Arduino UNO are boards used in interfacing above mentioned sensors. MQ-135 is air pollution gas sensor interfaced with Arduino uno and DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor is interfaced with Raspberry pi 3 along with HW-611 e/p 280 atmospheric pressure detection sensor. As soon as atmospheric pressure sensor detects air pressure with humidity and temperature the result obtained will automatically get fed in ThingSpeak IOT app. After wards, derived value on IOT can be read. To run Arduino uno board Arduino IDE software have been used. Arduino IDE software is an open source software that makes easy code writing, compiling and then it uploads the code on the basis of circuitry designed in UNO board. Raspberry pi installation requires a long running process and to run the circuitry a software named Putty is required. Coding is done in Python as Putty work with python. Installation of Raspbian OS in the fresh flashed SD card is the basic step to give power to raspberry pi. The models have been implemented on ThingSpeak using cloud computing. Sensors used in the presented work have been interfaced to their respective board in order to perform detection of various parameters in real time and obtain detection results simultaneously.",

        "Abstract": "This article proposes a new field of research called Cloud Networked Robotics, which tackles the issues for supporting daily activity, especially for the elderly and the disabled, throughout various locations in a continuously and seamless manner by abstracting robotic devices and providing a means for utilizing them as a cloud of robots. With recent advances in robotic development environments and in integrated multi-robot systems, robots are acquiring richer functionalities and robotic systems are becoming much easier to develop. However, such stand-alone robotic services are not enough for continuously and seamlessly supporting daily activity. We examine the requirements in typical daily supporting services through example scenarios that target senior citizens and the disabled. Based on these requirements, we discuss the key research issues in cloud network robotics. As a case study, a field experiment in a shopping mall shows how our proposed prototype infrastructure of cloud networked robotics enables multi-location robotic services for life support.",

        "Abstract": "Blind programmers use a screen reader to read code aloud. Screen readers force blind programmers to read code sequentially one line at a time. In contrast, sighted programmers are able to skim visually to the most important code areas, assisted by syntax highlighting. However, there is a place where there is a widely adopted approach to skimming a structured document: the web. Modern screen readers employ what is known as a virtual cursor to navigate structural information on webpages such as HTML heading tags. These tags can indicate different sections and subsections in the structure of a page. We harness the existing familiarity of blind computer users with this interface in our approach which we call AudioHighlight. AudioHighlight renders the code inside a web view, either as part of the Eclipse IDE or as a web service. It places HTML heading tags on the structural elements of a source file such as classes, functions and control flow statements. We compare AudioHighlight to the state of the art in code skimming represented by a previous code skimming approach called StructJumper. We also compare to the state of practice in reading code on the web as represented by GitHub. We found that AudioHighlight increased the quality and speed of code comprehension as compared to both approaches.",

        "Abstract": "JavaScript is the de facto programming language for the Web. It is used to implement mail clients, office applications, or IDEs, that can weight hundreds of thousands of lines of code. The language itself is prototype based, but to master the complexity of their application, practitioners commonly rely on informal class abstractions. This practice has never been the target of empirical research in JavaScript. Yet, understanding it is key to adequately tuning programming environments and structure libraries such that they are accessible to programmers. In this paper we report on a large and in-depth study to understand how class emulation is employed in JavaScript applications. We propose a strategy to statically detect class-based abstractions in the source code of JavaScript systems. We used this strategy in a dataset of 50 popular JavaScript applications available from GitHub. We found four types of JavaScript software: class-free (systems that do not make any usage of classes), class-aware (systems that use classes, but marginally), class-friendly (systems that make a relevant usage of classes), and class-oriented (systems that have most of their data structures implemented as classes). The systems in these categories represent, respectively, 26%, 36%, 30%, and 8% of the systems we studied.",

One of the aspects of software engineering is selecting and managing licenses for the given project. In this paper, we present SORREL-a plugin for managing licenses and detecting potential incompatibilities for IntelliJ IDEA, a popular Java IDE. The plugin scans the project in search of information about the project license and the licenses of its libraries. If the project does not yet have a license, the plugin provides the developer with recommendations for choosing the most suitable open license, and if there is a license, it informs the programmer about potential licensing violations. The tool makes it easier for developers to choose a proper license for a project and avoid most of the licensing errors-all inside the familiar IDE editor. The plugin and its source code are available online on GitHub: https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/sorrel. A demonstration video can be found at https://youtu.be/doUeAwPjcPE.",

        "Abstract": "Programming videos on the Internet are valuable resources for learning programming skills. To find relevant videos, developers typically search online video platforms (e.g., YouTube) with keywords on topics they wish to learn. Developers often look for live-coding screencasts, in which the videos' authors perform live coding. Yet, not all programming videos are live-coding screencasts. In this work, we develop a tool named PSFinder to identify live-coding screencasts. PSFinder leverages a classifier to identify whether a video frame contains an IDE window. It uses a sampling strategy to pick a number of frames from an input video, runs the classifer on these frames, and then determines whether the video is a live-coding screencast based on frames classified as containing IDE window. In our preliminary experiment, PSFinder can effectively identify live-coding screencasts as it achieves an F1-score of 0.97.",

        "Abstract": "Nowadays online resources play an important role in teaching and learning thanks to new advances in technology. This importance is enhanced in scientific areas and even more for distance education universities, where the classic hands-on laboratories are not always possible. For that reason, this face-to-face laboratory practices have been replaced or even complemented with online virtual and remote laboratories VRL. Normally, these applications are developed with high level programming tools, and these, to greater or lesser extent, use Java. Unfortunately, the newly discovered Java security issues and the impossibility to run Java in smart devices are an restriction to the dissemination of this kind of applications. This work is the first step towards get a new structure to Easy Java/Javascript Simulations (EjsS) that allows a remote connection with hardware devices. In this regard, the first objective is to solve the problems with Java applications when using EjsS. The proposed solution provides the user a structure to reuse their VRLs using a Java model that runs in a server and is linked with a Javascript graphical user interface in the client device.",

        "Abstract": "Developers frequently backtrack while coding. They go back to an earlier state by removing inserted code or by restoring removed code for various reasons. However, little is known about when and how the developers backtrack, and modern IDEs do not provide much assistance for backtracking. As a first step towards gathering baseline knowledge about backtracking and designing more robust backtracking assistance tools in modern IDEs, we conducted an exploratory study with 12 professional developers and a follow-up online survey. Our study revealed several barriers they faced while backtracking. Subjects often manually commented and uncommented code, and often had difficulty finding relevant parts to backtrack. Backtracking was reported to be needed by 3/4 of the developers at least “sometimes”.",

        "Abstract": "Distributed computing, computer networking, and the Internet of Things are all around us, yet only computer science and engineering majors learn the technologies that enable our modern lives. This paper introduces PhoneIoT, a mobile app that makes it possible to teach some of the basic concepts of distributed computation and networked sensing to novices. PhoneIoT turns mobile phones and tablets into IoT devices and makes it possible to create highly engaging projects through NetsBlox, an open-source block-based programming environment focused on teaching distributed computing at the high school level. PhoneIoT lets NetsBlox programs-running in the browser on the student's computer—access available sensors. Since phones have touchscreens, PhoneIoT also allows building a GUI remotely from NetsBlox, which can be set to trigger custom code written by the student via NetsBlox's message system. The approach enables students to create quite advanced distributed projects, such as turning their phone into a game controller or tracking their exercise on top of an interactive Google Maps background with just a few blocks of code.",

        "Abstract": "Nowadays to deliver any enterprise application into the market the functionality of the application is tested over the automated environment. The application is developed using different software development life cycle approaches like waterfall and agile. The traditional development tool needs a lot of manual intervention and manpower which is a time-consuming process. In the case of agile, the trail deployment build happens once which is difficult to fix and rectify the bugs. To improve the quality and the speed of development DevOps came into a picture that can build and deploy the application at stages. To do the continuous integration and delivery the automation tools like Jenkins, bamboo, and Travis CI are available in the market. The proposed approach utilizes the azure cloud DevOps along with the feature of Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment. The application is built and can be auto-configured in a cloud platform which greatly improves the build and deployment speed. The parallel and continuous integration adopts the dynamic changes effectively using the automation tools.",

It uses a programming model that combines constraints and finite state machines to specify interactive behaviors. Euclase is “live” in the sense that while the user is developing code, their program is always executing. Changes made to the source of the program are reflected immediately in the running program. We identify some of the implementation and design challenges of making our development environment live, including performance issues, ensuring predictability, dealing with errors in the source, and handling edge cases such as the removal of code that is currently running. We also discuss how Euclase's use of finite state machines and constraints can help alleviate these difficulties.",

        "Abstract": "Nowadays, any kind of user-side applications such as enterprise, banking, game, and so forth are almost parts of or invoked through web and/or smart-device native applications. Each vender of the application has its own development environment to keep up with the market needs. The development environment is usually for a specific environment, which consists of platform (operating systems and/or middleware) dependent tools, representation, and languages. The variety of the environment is vast and is a cause of delayed delivery of a product. The software architecture choice is important for high-quality application development but is depend on the platforms. The architecture has many variations because of vast variety of platforms. The purpose of this research is to design the universal architecture for the application. Based on the architecture, we designed generator and meta-generator for development of the application. We have developed a large application in a practical use, and developed several generators for that application based on the universal architecture we designed. The outcomes of the research are: - The universal architecture eases to port a specific environment-dependent techniques and knowledge to another. - We could design and implemented generators and meta generators for the development based on the architecture.",

        "Abstract": "Cloud Computing is a promising paradigm designed to harness the power of networks of computers and communications in a more cost effective way. Clouds provide elastic capacity to serve a wide and constantly expanding range of information processing needs, including government, military, business and education. The Cloud Computing paradigm is maturing rapidly and is being considered for adoption in government and business platforms. Open source systems refer to software systems whose source code is available, allowing for immediate incorporation of improvements and adaptations of the system by its users. This paper reports on an evaluation of open source development tools for Cloud Computing. The main tools examined are Eucalyptus, Apache Hadoop, and the Django-Python stack. These tools were used at different layers in the construction of a notional application for managing weather data. The results of our experience are reported in terms of a capability matrix that grades nine different aspects associated with the use of these tools in the development and deployment of applications in open source Cloud Computing environments.",

        "Abstract": "Interplanetary Simulation Environment for Communication and Thermal Subsystems (InSECTS) is an environment designed to support rapid prototyping of spacecraft containerized software on-orbit. The InSECTS digital architecture was developed to support NASA/JHU-APL Dragonfly autonomous software development and proliferated space-based containerized processing at Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering. Processing needs for deep space, scientific, and National Security spacecraft software are continually evolving to support exceedingly diverse mission requirements. As a result of this evolution, Spacecraft software engineers require a pathway for rapidly testing, updating, and deploying software to on-orbit cloud processing clusters in an economical and responsible way. InSECTS supports this need by providing a low-cost prototype of an on-orbit processing architecture affording developers the capability to test and deploy cloud-based software to operational spacecraft, while mitigating the risks involved with traditional space system development. The InSECTS digital architecture supports any open-source initiative compliant containerized application on a hardware agnostic distributed Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) computing environment. Additionally, by utilizing preexisting container orchestration software the environment is inherently redundant across multiple independent processing suites. Finally, InSECTS design is configurable which allows it to function as a payload on a small satellite or as its own microsatellite. The InSECTS cloud-agnostic ground system is accessible with Internet of Things (IoT) devices and has a Development Operations (DEVOPS) pipeline that supports open-source software code development. This gives engineers and researchers building software the ability to write, integrate, and deploy software containers into the InSECTS environment using development tools broadly accessible across the industry. To verify these technical solutions, an InSECTS prototype was demonstrated at Johns Hopkins University by deploying an autonomy software cluster able to control a thermal control system model designed after the NASA/APL Dragonfly thermonuclear generator. As a result of this successful test, further InSECTS development at Johns Hopkins is planned and may include a functional small satellite for on-orbit testing. This satellite would provide a testbed for containerized processing in the space environment utilizing COTS hardware for cloud-agnostic software deployments capable of supporting the diverse processing requirements of future National Security and deep space systems.",

        "Abstract": "The Boolean network model is one of the major coarse-grained approaches for modeling Genetic Regulatory Networks. The present day technologies, such as DNA microarray chips, allow for the simultaneous monitoring of genes expression of thousands of genes. The data obtained from this technique can be used to identify Genetic Regulatory networks and to enable understanding of the complexities of Genetic regulatory processes. The topology of the network can be identified in three steps: · Identification of the elements in a Genetic regulatory network · Identification of the edges between the elements in a Genetic Regulatory Network · Identification of the Boolean functions which define the value of the vertex in the following step, depending on the present values of inputs. Once one has identified the above mentioned elements defining the specific Genetic Regulatory Network case, they can be imported in the simulation software for future simulations of real conditions. I have created computer simulation software based on the Boolean Regulatory Network model, which can be used for such simulations. The software is created using the Java programming language and Eclipse Ganymede IDE. It is created as a Java applet and it can be used via an Internet browser anywhere in the world. The software can be found at the following link: http://www.compunet.com.mk/orce/.",

        "Abstract": "Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) is a new form of online education that has attracted increasing attention from the Chinese education community in recent years. Traditional English CAI (Computer-Assisted Instruction) does not pay enough attention to the differences among students in teaching and cannot provide more comprehensive services. In the traditional LTSA (Learning Technology Systems Architecture) framework, the relationship between teachers and resources is dominant, while the relationship between learners and resources is ignored. The MOOC system can balance the relationship between teachers, learners, and teaching resources, and can automatically push personalized learning plans and develop one-on-one learning methods based on students' mastery of knowledge and their own strengths, thereby helping students improve learning efficiency. With the development of the times, more and more people are using MOOC systems, but the current GLR (Generalized Likelihood Ratio) algorithm's system running speed is not fast enough and accurate enough to effectively formulate personalized plans for people. What this paper studies is to improve the GLR algorithm to improve the running speed of the system, better design personalized learning programs for people, and develop and design a Business English MOOC system. This system uses Idea as the development tool and MySQL as the database, using the current mainstream development framework technology SpringBoot and improving the GLR algorithm to enhance system functionality. Experiments have shown that the MOOC system can indeed strengthen the connection between learners and resources and improve learners' learning efficiency. According to the proposed learner behavior evaluation model formula, the score of the MOOC system is 10 points higher than the traditional method, and the improved algorithm improves the accuracy of personalized schemes by about 10% compared to the previous one, reducing the time spent by nearly half. The improved GLR algorithm can not only accelerate the speed of formulating personalized plans, but also improve accuracy.",

The technology enables us to deliver applications easily and quickly, and provides more efficient methods to do maintenance and updates. Web application developments present specific challenges to developers, such as content-rich, security, volatile system requirements, application scalability, rapidly evolving development tools, and ever increasing demand for fast system deployment by customers. These add up to the difficulty of software project planning, budgeting, and controlling. In recent years a number of new development methodologies, called agile methodologies, have become increasingly popular in the software industry. This paper reviews several major agile methodologies, compares them with traditional methods, and proposes a selection framework for business. The paper also provides a case study of an early attempt to use agile development at Intel. The success at Intel proved that agile methods can be used to develop successful web-based applications at large organizations.",

        "Abstract": "This work describes a unique multidisciplinary and international project and experience that combines cultural studies with a digital mapping project. The program had three major education objectives. As this experience was an international one, the most fundamental objective was to introduce students to another culture and to develop an understanding of the history of that culture. The second goal was to expose students to geographical information system (GIS) applications and to develop fundamental skills in GIS and in Web page construction. The third was to develop professional interpersonal skills in the areas of multidisciplinary teamwork and oral presentations. To accomplish these objectives, multidisciplinary teams of students used GIS and Web development tools to develop chronological maps of the city of Cordoba, Spain, covering 2000 years of history. The undergraduate students were from the science, engineering, social science, and humanities backgrounds. The specific pedagogical elements of the experience, the results of the mapping project, and a summary of the lessons learned are presented.",

        "Abstract": "This paper provides a detailed exposition of the concept of ontology, focusing on the processes and methodologies involved in its construction. The utilization of ontologies has played a significant role in the advancement of the Semantic Web. It is an expansion of the existing World Wide Web, characterized by the provision of well-defined meanings to information. This facilitates the translation of unstructured data into meaningful representations, thereby enabling effective collaboration between humans and computers. Ontology can be described as a compilation of a group of concepts, along with their corresponding definitions and interconnections, which are structured hierarchically and referred to as Taxonomy. Several ontology development tools are accessible, such as Hozo, DOML, and AltovaSemantic Works. Protégé, a commonly utilized ontology development editor, has been employed to define ontology concepts. In addition, it provides support for multiple ontology representation languages, such as OWL. The present study demonstrates the process of ontology development through the utilization of Protégé 3.4.1, with a specific focus on the domain of automobiles. A case study is presented to exemplify the application of this methodology.",

        "Abstract": "Developing and experimenting IoT applications are still difficult and time-consuming, mainly due to their heterogeneous hardware and diverse software. Testbeds are useful for developers to test the performance of IoT applications before deploying them to the fields. In this paper, we present LinkLab (http://linklab.emnets.org), a scalable IoT testbed for heterogeneous devices. Compared with existing IoT testbeds, LinkLab not only supports running experiments but also supports remote development via a web-based IDE and remote compiling. Therefore, LinkLab is able to improve the efficiency of the developing-experimenting-optimizing loop for IoT developers. By using a distributed architecture, LinkLab is a scalable, multi-site, and multi-user IoT testbed, with fine-grained access control and a flexible naming mechanism. Further, an incremental online compilation and a multi-user cache techniques are used to speed up the cross compilation process. LinkLab is implemented with more than 150 IoT devices and evaluated by case studies, micro-benchmarks, and real experiments. Results show that LinkLab achieves convenient application development, efficient online compilation, and robust device management under various evaluation settings.",

        "Abstract": "A real time computer system is a system that must perform its functions within specified time bounds. These systems are generally characterized by complex interactions with the environment in which they operate and strict time constraints whose violation may have catastrophic consequences. The need for these software systems to be highly reliable is evident. One way to achieve this reliability is through formal development. Although research in the area of real time systems has been quite active and a number of experimental environments supporting formal specifications have been developed, the search for adequate notations and tools is still ongoing. In order to get designers to use formal methods to develop real time systems it is necessary to provide them with an integrated set of tools for writing and analyzing their specifications. The ASTRAL Software Development Environment (SDE), which is an integrated set of tools based on the ASTRAL formal framework, is intended to meet this need. The tools that make up the support environment are a syntax directed editor, a specification processor, a verification condition generator, a mechanical theorem prover, and a browser kit. The paper discusses the goals for ASTRAL, why they were important, and how they were met. It also gives an overview of the ASTRAL Software Development Environment.",

However, previous studies have found that existing tools provide little level of satisfaction of the teachers' and students' needs. One of these requirements is the learning of concurrent and distributed programming, despite the increasing importance of these computing paradigms. This article reports the implementation of an online judge prototype for concurrent programming and its evaluation through a quasi-experiment. Although no significant differences were found with respect to the traditional tools used in the course, indications were obtained that the students who used the online judge prototype produced solutions with fewer programming anomalies. Regarding motivational aspects, students reported a better user experience, especially those who were able to contrast the online judge against the traditional development tools used in the course.",

        "Abstract": "The amount of accessible computational devices over the Internet offers an enormous but latent computational power. Nonetheless, the complexity of orchestrating and managing such devices requires dedicated architectures and tools and hinders the exploitation of this vast processing capacity. Over the last years, the paradigm of (Browser-based) Volunteer Computing emerged as a unique approach to harnessing such computational capabilities, leveraging the idea of voluntarily offering resources. This article proposes VFuse, a groundbreaking architecture to exploit the Browser-based Volunteer Computing paradigm via a ready-to-access volunteer network. VFuse offers a modern multi-language programming environment for developing scientific workflows using WebAssembly technology without requiring the user any local installation or configuration. We equipped our architecture with a secure and transparent rewarding mechanism based on blockchain technology (Ethereum) and distributed P2P file system (IPFS). Further, the use of Non-Fungible Tokens provides a unique, secure, and transparent methodology for recognizing the users’ participation in the network. We developed a prototype of the proposed architecture and four example applications implemented with our system. All code and examples are publicly available on GitHub.",

        "Abstract": "All over the world people can gain the information at the same time by growing rate of Internet access around the world in recent years. In accordance with such a penetration of the Internet, it is increasing public awareness of the importance of online real-time and interactive functions. Therefore, software development environment has been changing into new development paradigms such as concurrent distributed development environment and the so-called open source project by using network computing technologies. Especially, such OSS (open source software) systems which serve as key components of critical infrastructures in our society are still ever-expanding now. In this paper, we propose a software reliability growth model based on stochastic differential equations in order to consider the active state of the open source project. Especially, we assume that the software failure intensity depends on the time, and the software fault-report phenomena on the bug tracking system keep an irregular state. Also, we analyze actual software fault count data to show numerical examples of software reliability assessment for the OSS. Moreover, we compare our model with the conventional model based on stochastic differential equations in terms of goodness-of-fit for actual data. We show that the proposed model can assist improvement of quality for OSS systems developed under the open source project.",

        "Abstract": "Adaptive decayed brain emotional learning (ADBEL) network is recently proposed for the online time series forecasting problems. As opposed to other popular learning networks, such as multilayer perceptron, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, and locally linear neuro-fuzzy model, ADBEL network offers lower computational complexity and fast learning, which make it an ideal candidate for the time series prediction in an online fashion. In fact, these prominent features are inherited from the mechanism employed by the limbic system of the mammalian brain in processing the external stimuli, which also forms the basis of the ADBEL network. This paper aims at further enhancing the forecasting performance of the ADBEL network through its integration with a neo-fuzzy network. The selection of the neo-fuzzy network is made as it offers features required for online prediction in real time environments including simplicity, transparency, accuracy, and lower computational complexity. Furthermore, this integration is only considered in the orbitofrontal cortex section of the ADBEL network and only three membership functions are employed to realize the neo-fuzzy neuron. Thus, the resultant neo-fuzzy integrated ADBEL (NF-ADBEL) network is still simple and can be deployed in online prediction problems. Few chaotic time series namely the Mackey glass, Lorenz, Rossler, and the Disturbance storm time index as well as the Narendra dynamic plant identification problem are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed NF-ADBEL network in terms of the root mean squared error and correlation coefficient criterions using MATLAB®programming environment.",

Solutions to these errors can often be found through discussions with other developers on the Internet. Unfortunately, many of these online discussions do not contain relevant answers. We have developed an approach to automatically query and analyze online discussions to locate relevant solutions to programming problems. Our tool, called Dora, is integrated into Visual Studio and allows developers to query and evaluate solutions within their development environment, enabling them to reduce context switching between their development tasks and their search sessions. We have performed a semi-controlled experiment to validate the utility of our search approach with 18 tasks, finding that our approach provides 55% more relevant results than traditional web searching approaches.",

This is achieved via a semi-structured editor and a programming language with several distinctive features, such as support for using smartphone hardware. In order to uncover opportunities for future tool development aimed at facilitating end-user programming of phones on phones, we have investigated the kinds of scripts that people are creating with the current tool set as well as what problems they ask for help with solving. This paper is the first to study how end-user programmers “in the wild” are programming mobile phones. In particular, no previous study has investigated the ways in which end users programmatically use mobile phones' special hardware (e.g., GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope) for practical everyday purposes. We discovered that, in essence, people are using TouchDevelop to create apps: downloadable applications with small, fairly reliable feature sets that take advantage of mobile hardware. In addition, we identified several areas for further innovation aimed at enhancing the programming tool and the online repository where users share scripts with one another.",

However, these are mainly used only in extracurricular activities to learn about the robots, take part in different contests or for research purposes. The research and practice of integrating web-enhanced learning environments and inquiry learning with robots is almost absent. The purpose of this paper is to present preliminary results of such a pilot study conducted in Estonia. Pupils used web-based worksheets, robots and a programming environment to conduct an inquiry experiment in physics. These worksheets consisted of two principal parts that followed the hypothesis and the experiment space of inquiry cycle. First results indicated that pupils manage fine in such an environment and acquire more knowledge through practical tests and inquiry learning with the use of robots.",

        "Abstract": "The system switch plays a crucial role in any automated test system as it provides ATE engineers the ability to distribute a finite amount of instrumentation I/O to multiple test points. The popularity of modular architectures such as VXI and PXI, created an opportunity for consolidation of instrumentation and switching within a single mainframe, resulting in high-channel count capability in a reduced footprint. A modular approach to switching systems also affords the ATE architect design flexibility through the use of domain-specific modules (i.e, power, RF, and analog) that can be combined to cover a broad range of the signal spectrum. Unfortunately, software development and integration can become unnecessarily complicated when the system switch is viewed simply as a collection of discrete modules that are assembled to accommodate the required I/O count. This paper will discuss web-based methodologies and software platforms that VTI Instruments has developed to create a versatile system-level switching programming environment. This framework, which is implemented on web-enabled LXI-based modular switch instruments, significantly reduces test program set development time and simplifies debugging and design validation activities without the overhead of third party configuration tools.",

        "Abstract": "The importance of content management systems (CMS) has increased dramatically in recent years, but the open source CMS is usually criticized for the lack of applications in manufacturing fields. CMS has predominantly focused on managing documents, and on the other hand, product data management (PDM) is a digital repository of product information, including non-paper representations like CAD files. In this paper, a web based PDM System is implemented and integrated with the open source CMS to cope with the tasks of the mechanical design. There are three major functions provided in this system. First of all, to provide users with a web based product data vault system for design related files storage. Secondly, a data-sharing and collaboration system are created to enhance the pre-manufacturing planning and detailed design communication. The third function of this system allows user to setup an efficient programming environment for the engineering analysis processes.",

A new Domotic OSGi Gateway (DOG) is presented, able to manage different domotic networks as a single, technology neutral, home automation system. The adoption of a standard framework such as OSGi, and of sophisticated modeling techniques stemming from the Semantic Web research community, allows DOG to go beyond simple automation and to support reasoning-based intelligence inside home environments. By exploiting automatic device generalization, syntactic and semantic command validation, and internetwork scenario definition, DOG provides the building blocks for supporting the evolution of current, isolated, home automation plants into IDEs, where heterogeneous devices and domotic systems are coordinated to behave as a single, intelligent, proactive system. The paper introduces the DOG architecture and the underlying ontology modeling. A case study is also illustrated, where DOG controls a laboratory reconstruction of a simple domotic environment.",

There exist complementary, less explorative methods, e.g., based on code search, code completion, or API documentation. In contrast, our approach is highly interactive and can be seen as an extension of what IDEs readily provide today. Exploration is based on multiple dimensions: i) the hierarchically organized scopes of projects and APIs; ii) metrics of API usage (e.g., number of project classes extending API classes); iii) metadata for APIs; iv) project- versus API-centric views. We also provide the QUAATLAS corpus of Java projects which enhances the existing QUALITAS corpus to enable API-usage analysis. We implemented the exploration approach in an open-source, IDE-like, Web-enabled tool EXAPUS.",

        "Abstract": "As computing becomes pervasive across fields, introductory computing curricula needs new tools to motivate and educate the influx of learners with little prior background and divergent goals. We seek to improve curricula by enriching it with authentic, real-world contexts and powerful scaffolds that can guide learners to success using automated tools, thereby reducing the strain on limited human instructional resources. To address these issues, we have created the BlockPy programming environment, a web-based, open-access, open-source platform for introductory computing students (https://www.blockpy.com). BlockPy has an embedded data science context that allows learners to connect the educational content with real-world scenarios through meaningful problems. The environment is block-based and gives guiding feedback to learners as they complete problems, but also mediates transfer to more sophisticated programming environments by supporting bidirectional, seamless transitions between block and text programming. Although it can be used as a stand-alone application, the environment has first-class support for the latest Learning Tools Interoperability standards, so that instructors can embed the environment directly within their Learning Management System. In this paper, we describe interesting design issues that we encountered during the development of BlockPy, an evaluation of the environment from fine-grained logs, and our future plans for the environment.",

        "Abstract": "Spoofing is a serious security issue for email applications. Although several anti-email spoofing techniques have been developed, most of them do not provide users with sufficient control and information on spoof attacks. In this paper a web-based client oriented anti-spoofing email application is proposed which actively detects, monitors and controls email spoofing attacks. When the application detects a spoofed message, it triggers an alert message and sends the spoofed message into a spoof filter. Moreover, the user who has received the spoofed message is given the option of notifying the real sender of the spoofing attack. In this way an active spoof control is achieved. The application is hosted using the HTTPS protocol and uses notification messages that are sent in parallel with email messages via a channel that has been secured by the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. The notification messages allows the application to detect spoofed emails. The application has been developed in PHP using the Netbeans IDE and provides a user-friendly interface which is easily deployable over the web.",

        "Abstract": "Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a prevalent cause of death and disability with over 3.8 million annual cases and 130 daily deaths in the United States alone. Whenever athletes suffer head trauma, concussion field tests that measure their perceptiveness and cognitive abilities are commonly administered. However, these tests have limited accuracy due to the lack of quantitative data basing the diagnosis, and often those administering concussion tests feel pressured to keep athletes playing in the game despite cognitive impairment. To solve this, an inexpensive diagnostic helmet targeting youth sports teams was created, providing quantitative data regarding how much head trauma an athlete has experienced. The helmet is connected to a web-based application system that stores real time data regarding the impact of the head injury, the region of the brain impacted, the time of injury, and speed at which the injury occurred, allowing for the design of more patient-tailored treatment plans. The device and web application were programmed using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the Node.js platform in the Intel Edison IoT IDE. Once the force sensitive resistors register an impact significant enough to cause a concussion based upon an algorithm that takes into consideration the player's height and weight, a text message is automatically sent to local paramedics through the Twilio API. This device therefore removes existing bias involved in diagnostics, allows doctors to more accurately handle injuries, and helps ensure player safety.",

        "Abstract": "To mitigate potential misinterpretation and security violations, software developers should use tools that reflect the state of web applications and visualise them as graphical models. Modelling helps to ensure that functionality and access control mechanisms are consistently interconnected. In this paper, we propose an approach to support Web application development using the Spring platform. Our proposal is supported by the Eclipse IDE plugin tool, which recognises Spring Security configuration captures, its notations, and visualises them in the role-based access control (RBAC) models. The RBAC models are represented using SecureUML modelling language. The plugin is validated through survey taken by software developers.",

State-of-the-art IoT cloud services are powerful, but the best solutions are proprietary, and there is a growing demand for interoperability and standardization. We have investigated how to develop a nonvendor-locked framework, which exploits state of the art data management technologies, and targets effective and efficient development in this article. Focusing on the concept of measurement, we abstracted an architecture that could be applied in a variety of domains and contexts. We tested the framework and its workflow in four use cases analyzing data and enabling new services in health, automotive, and instruction. Our experience showed the benefits of the development tool, which is not tied to a commercial platform, nor requires the huge set-up times needed to start a project from scratch. The tool is released open-source, particularly supporting collaborative research.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, there has been an increase in video surveillance systems in public and private environments due to a heightened sense of security like, CCTV and RFID. There are several defects in the video surveillance systems such as picture is indistinct, complex structure, Poor stability, lot of storage space is needed to save the surveillance information and prices remain relatively high. This paper proposes the real time security surveillance system using IoT. The system design uses Motion Detection algorithm written in Python as a default programming environment. This significantly decreases the storage usage and save investment cost. The algorithm for Motion Detection is being implemented on low processing power chip Raspberry pi 2 and Pi camera, which enables live video streaming with detection of moving objects and get alarm when motion is detected and sends photos, videos to a cloud server directly using pi camera. When cloud is not available then the data is stored locally on raspberry pi and sent when the connection resumes. The camera is mounted on the motor and its movement (Left/Right) is controlled through IoT webpage by the user, thus providing user with enhanced view of the surroundings.",

With advantages of these two rising technologies, we can build up a convenient parallel programming environment and make effective use of system resources in cloud computing. In this paper, we describe the effects of different virtualization technologies which one of MapReduce running environments, Hadoop, works in. Then we compared the Hadoop Distributed File System performance running in three types of virtual machines, analyze the resource utility of MapReduce using virtual machines monitor tools which detect the status of task trackers and test MapReduce performance in the cases of different numbers of virtual machines with the same total memories. Experiment results show that Xen performs better than other virtual machines both on performance and stability. And the tools of virtual machine monitor report information of MapReduce different stages and resources utility can greatly help us design a adaptive scheduling. Moreover, better performance can be achieved with more virtual machines under the adequate memory of every virtual machines.",

        "Abstract": "Traditionally, program comprehension functionality is implemented with stand-alone tools. As a result, software engineers typically have to switch between various tools during comprehension activities. Each of these tools has its own idiosyncratic user interface and interaction paradigm, causing an unfavorable learning curve. As a result, many program comprehension tools fail to be adopted. Software engineering activities that involve program comprehension (e.g., maintenance) require the use of forward engineering tools (e.g., compilers) as well as reverse engineering tools (e.g., class hierarchy visualizers). Thus, extending forward engineering tools such as IDEs (e.g., Eclipse) or Web authoring tools (e.g., GoLive) by seamlessly adding program comprehension functionality helps software engineers and improves the adoption of comprehension functionality. In this paper, we introduce an adoption-centric tool development approach that leverages a Web authoring tool, GoLive, by grafting functionality for Web site comprehension on top. The benefits and drawbacks of this approach from the tool-user's as well as the tool-builder's perspective are discussed.",

In this application, parts of a human-shaped pictogram can be moved using a command sequence called the “Pictogram Animation Command.” The application also enables the drawing of the movement history of a body and this drawing is called the “Pictogram graphics”, which is similar to turtle graphics. This paper presents extend “Pictogram graphics” to draw using the movement history of specified body parts, called “Human Motion Drawing”. Through this method, various figures can be drawn by sequentially or concurrently combining certain simple commands. We conduct the some lessons with 2-class of 80 second-year junior high school students to evaluate the effectiveness of this method by SD (Semantic Differential) scale method and analyzing free form text. We found the result of the lesson which learned by this proposed method was well as rest of lessons.",

        "Abstract": "Today's increased use of nonlinear loads injects voltage and current harmonics in Electrical Distribution Networks and creates new problems of Power Quality in the power System. Conventional power systems are designed to operate on sinusoidal power supply. Electric utilities strive to supply consumers with reliable & pure sinusoidal electric power that does not represent a damaging threat to their equipment. In the restructured power system, prices of the power are associated to power Quality. Hence it is very important to monitor and ensure Power Quality. Harmonics is the major issue in this context. This paper presents an innovative way of real time harmonic measurement using ADE 7880 and its assessment with automatic meter reading (AMR) on smart phone. During preparation of this paper fifty sight visits are done covering the non-linear loads like IT Industries, Steel Industries, Paper Industries, workshops etc. It is observed that the current harmonics generated are beyond the tolerable limits. Readings are taken at consumer end with the help of standard power analyzer for a period of 24 hrs. Sample of the readings are considered for analysis purpose. Further it is also observed that many literatures are available in the area of Harmonic measurement but they do not have the capacity to identify the limits of harmonics as per the standards used like IEC 61000-2-2 or IEEE 519-1996 or EN 50160. In this paper GUI is developed in java to assess the harmonics and identify the harmonic presence with specific color codes. The solution will display the abnormal harmonics in red color and normal below the threshold value by the green color. Through this color coding technique an unskilled worker can easily identify the objectionable presence of harmonics. It creates the awareness in the utility for measurement and control of harmonics which in turn helps to improve the Power Quality. A combined Zigbee and GSM technology is also developed to communicate the data received at consumer end to the central server. Along with the central PC information can also be transferred on smart phone by capturing the data from remote location and processing it with a programming tool on smart phone. The main advantage of this method is Remote data logging, as it does not require collecting data physically from actual site. The numeric meter sends data to microcontroller using zigbee module and further to the web server of Central Monitoring System through GSM. This data is processed and analyzed by the source code available in smart phone. For this purpose, the relevant compilers can be installed in the smart phone.",

        "Abstract": "Traffic congestion has become a major problem in the urban cities, and it is mainly caused due to an increase in population which causes traffic congestion. It therefore becomes a problem for the emergency vehicles for example, an ambulance, to arrive as early as possible to its destination without appropriate traffic control system. So it was essential to design a traffic control system which will be controlled by an android mobile device via the cloud environment. In this paper we explored other intelligent traffic light systems and other transportation systems. This system has to allow the Android mobile device (emergency vehicle) to override the normal operation of a traffic signal. An efficient and cost effective system which can solve this problem is an Android and Cloud based traffic control system using the GSM module. The system comprises of five stages which are Android mobile device, GSM module, MQTT (IoT) for Arduino IDE, Arduino Uno microcontroller and traffic signals. The developed system has allowed the Android mobile device (emergency vehicle) to override the normal operation of a traffic signal.",

        "Abstract": "IoT Devices have revolutionized how people interact with each other and their surroundings, with Gartner predicting 50 billion devices by 2020. IoT devices emerging from WSN to RFIDs are capable of sensing, actuating and sharing data but are resource-constrained devices meaning these devices have limited memory, storage, and computation power. Thus, IoT devices are incapable of securing themselves from various security and privacy threats. Moreover, current Cloud-IoT architectures are centralized; managed and controlled by Trusted Third parties also individuals have no control over their data. Fog-IoT integration has better latency, response time and is much secure compared to Cloud-IoT integration. Recently, Blockchain emerged as a decentralized, highly trusted and tamper-proof technology. In this paper, we proposed a blockchain-based scheme for secure User authentication access to Fog enabled IoT devices. The proposed scheme utilizes the Ethereum Smart Contract. We developed our smart contract using Solidity language with Remix-IDE and tested its functionalities on two test networks Test RPC (Ganache) and Rinkeby Test Network. We also analyzed security vulnerabilities of our smart contract on the ChainSecurity analyzing tool.",

        "Abstract": "Patrol and Surveillance could be dangerous and arduous in ecological environment protection. In this paper, we presents a new design of unmanned all-terrain vehicle (U-ATV) system based on open source framework. According to bottom-up design principles, this system consists four layers: robot body layer, data service layer, cloud service layer, user interaction layer. The open source based linux OS is deployed in both robot system and cloud system. The U-ATV robot is driven by ROS kinematic engine. The perception information from many kinds of sensing devices is collected by C++/Python interfaces. The user interaction is realized by QT based cross-platform IDE software. The experiments demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this design based on a hard-in-Ioop robotic driving and operation testing platform.",

        "Abstract": "In the recent years, the extensive use of cloud computing in IT industry has led to excessive consumption of energy in the data centers, which of course, has become a matter of thought. To save energy in cloud data centers, dynamic virtual machine consolidation can be thought of one of the best methods. In this approach, some of the under-loaded physical machines (PMs)are put either into low-power mode or are switched-off with the help of live migration of Virtual Machines(VMs). But the number of migrations may also produce more Carbon dioxide emissions and indirectly much energy is consumed. To avoid this situation, clustering of PMs can be done and these clusters can be assigned to the respective consolidation managers. Consolidation of VM is strictly NP-hard problem, so, we are using the hybrid of metaheuristic optimization algorithms. The hybrid of algorithms is expected to produce better results in terms of number of migrations and energy consumption. This hybrid canbe implemented using various tools like CloudSim embedded with either Eclipse IDE or Netbeans.",

Buildings, a significant contributor to energy consumption, must evolve towards becoming “smart” through the deployment of appropriate Energy Management Systems (EMS). Central to any EMS is Energy Incident Management (EIM), an essential tool in the timely detection and alerting of potential energy incidents and faults. This paper delves deeper into the complexities of designing a real-time, energy-efficient EIM, which extracts and processes data while leveraging Machine Learning (ML) predictive analytics to forecast possible energy incidents. Our methodology harnesses principles of Data Science, whereby data from diverse sources is amassed, purified, and readied for use by the ML predictive analytics model. To implement our EIM, we embrace a Cloud-based strategy, taking advantage of existing Cloud technologies to encapsulate all phases of the Data Science process within a comprehensive, unified framework (IDE).",

        "Abstract": "To be sure, flooding is one of the most devastating natural calamities that needs to be addressed. It has widespread repercussions for the economy and has caused many deaths. Lack of warning causes a great deal of annual mortality. This study employed the NodeMCU, ultrasonic sensors, and other sensors to detect and measure the depths of flood waters. Here, we measure changes in the river's level with the help of an ultrasonic HC-SR04 sensor and a NodeMCU ESP8266 Microcontroller. The information after processing will be sent to the ThingSpeak IoT Cloud Platform. With this method, river levels may be tracked graphically from any location. The circuit's software was programmed using the Arduino IDE and uploaded to the Arduino microcontroller's memory. The study concluded that the proposed sensor could precisely determine the location of an incoming object and present that information as a distance on the ThingSpeak Cloud Platform. Concurrently, the sensor shows off LED indicators for your eyes to feast over. Based on data from an Arduino Uno, this system uses the Internet of Things to issue warnings to the proper authorities ahead of time of any impending floods.",

The design circuit will contain a resistive temperature sensor connected in a bridge configuration and a capacitive humidity sensor. For the data to be read by the microcontroller, a signal conditioning block will be designed to amplify the outputs of the two sensors and bring them into the input range of the analog-to-digital converter. USB heating elements will be used to adjust the temperature. An 8-bit ATMEL family microcontroller will be used and the program will be developed using the Code Vision AVR compiler. In order to validate the data, a comparison will be made between the monitoring system described above and a LIBELIUM Smart Environment plate containing calibrated sensors that provide very good temperature and humidity values based on a set sampling frequency. The development environment for the LIBELIUM is ARDUINO, which will send the data over the Wi-Fi network using the MQTT protocol to a SQL database with a Grafana web interface for viewing. In order to alert medical staff to exceeding the range of temperature or humidity values, I will also implement a code to send email alerts from the Grafana web interface that communicates with LIBELIUM Smart Environment.",

This paper proposes a Web services-based architecture for WPS design and simulation. This novel architecture wraps the legacy energy management system (EMS) functions into standard Web service interfaces, and provides standard remote computing and security evaluation services from EMS to WPS. Under this architecture, WPS scheme is simulated and tested efficiently and the gap between the simulation environment and the running environment is filled",

Examples of such systems are Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems which are used to collect and transmit livestock’s information to host devices. Sophisticated RFID readers are very expensive, and more functional than the cheap ones whose use are mostly limited to reading and transmission of tag IDs. Cross-platform mobile applications will allow monitoring of livestock irrespective of the platform on which mobile devices are being operated. Farmers’ secured access to records via web services is not limited to a device as they can login on any mobile device with the installed application. In this work, a mobile platform which consists of a cross-platform mobile application, webservice and database is developed to cost-effectively manage and exploit records of livestock acquired using a cheap RFID reader. The mobile application was developed using a Xamarin form framework. The programming language and development environment used are C# and Visual studio respectively. Records of livestock were acquired, posted, updated, deleted and retrieved from the database via a web service. Additional advantages offer by the solution implemented include, exporting of animals’ records via email and SMS, viewing of animal’s record by scanning their tags or QR code of animals’ passports, and login system to sign users in and out of the application. Development of RFID readers with sensors to acquire health-related parameters for health monitoring is recommended.",

The main challenges of the SG are the smart metering system(SMS),. The main goal of this research paper is the design and the implementation of a smart metering model devoted to the Tunisian conventional grid using the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) to enable the intelligence of the Tunisian power grid. To achieve this goal, we have developed a web portal for the Tunisian electrical data company to acquire the realtime load use according to the previous load data measurement and the solar radiation prediction without resorting to the conventional meters for the electrical data reading. The implemented web portal for Tunisian electrical grid has predicted the daily and monthly energy consumption and has sent warning notifications to inform subscribers about the peak power period and to present the overall state of power grid. The used development environment for the smart metering implementation is Software Development kit (SDK) for Android and the obtained results are acquired by using the Am Chart of SDK for Android, the obtained curves are generated by both SDK for Android and Excel software.",

However, many problems have been exposed in pure HLA-based simulation as further expansion goes with the application of simulation, such as poor portability of RTI, less reusability of federate general code, and the limitation among the field of cross majors, interdisciplinary and the application. In the developing of the federation, the simulation technique based on the automatically generation of federate framework has greatly reduce the repeated achievement of common function, The use of Web service also solve the current limitations of HLA applications. This paper propose a solution to the development of HLA federate framework code based on the Web service, and design a kind of tool which makes federal developer do not have to take into account the RTI and underlying interface when the simulation system was developed. The difference on platform and development environment in the reuse of resources won't be a consideration, neither. In order to achieve better between applications in the simulation system and change function calls into service calls within the systems into and publish the service interfaces to the Internet, to fulfill the objective resource sharing and Cross-platform Interaction.",

Web Services have specific scenarios in which distributed processes and network resources are used. This aspect of services requires integration with the model checkers. This article presents the experimentation framework in which services can be specified and then formally analyzed for deadlock-freedom, achievement of process goals, and similar features. Rybu4WS language enriches the basic Rybu language with the ability to use variables in processes, service calls between servers, new structural instructions, and other constructions known to programmers while remaining in line with declarative, mathematical IMDS formalism. Additionally, the development environment allows simulation of a counterexample or a witness - obtained as a result of the model checking - in a similar way to traditional debuggers.",

We propose an intelligent agent-based component for Web GIS. The component comprises serveral coordinated agents for users to retrieve geographic information. Function logic of server part, processing logic of client part and underlying operation of system, including interaction with operating system, network, and database, are separately designed so as achieve maximal stability. Independence between modules ensures extensibility. Advanced functions such as map management, user management and data management are also integrated. By the Web GIS component, users can conduct roaming and zooming in several map layers, spatial information analysis and retrieval. The component provides API for application developers, data distributors and spatial database engine vendors so that they can add dynamic, data-driven map to applications. The component can be integrated into development environment easily, reducing application system complexity, easing development progress, sparing as much cost as possible and promoting maintainability as well.",

        "Abstract": "Education in information systems requires at least an exploration of alternatives in teaching software development. The following phrase is from the Free Software Foundation [1]: \"To use free software is to make a political and ethical choice asserting the right to learn, and share what we learn with others.\" At first, it is not obvious how this freedom could be applied to education. In software, services around free software [2] provide an added value that customers are ready to pay for. In education, free course material has a potential of free software. Free course material supports the right to learn and share what we learn with others. However, educational services, such as teaching courses, may hopefully provide added values. In order to provide some examples, I will focus in this paper on using free software in education of students in information systems. I will start with the issue of providing some basic development skills to new Web generations of students. In order to break from the old ways of educating, the free course material is spread over the Web with a base at the Assembla [3] development environment.",

However, it is not clear how to set the free parameters namely alpha, beta and gamma of the network. In this work, we present a fuzzy logic based model for adjusting these ADBEL network parameters in an online manner which will not jeopardize the simplicity and quickness of the network. The proposed model uses prediction error and reward signals as inputs and produces the network parameters as outputs. Further, the fuzzy logic based model employs a small rule base to vary the network parameters in order to maintain the complexity of the ADBEL network at minimum. Few chaotic time series namely the Mackey glass, Lorenz, Rossler, and the disturbance storm time index are used to check the validity of the fuzzy logic based parameter adjustment model for ADBEL network using MATLAB® programming environment.",

        "Abstract": "J-DSP is a java-based object-oriented online programming environment developed at Arizona State University for education and research. This paper presents a collection of interactive Java modules for the purpose of introducing undergraduate and graduate students to feature extraction in music and audio signals. These tools enable online simulations of different algorithms that are being used in applications related to content-based audio classification and Music Information Retrieval (MIR). The simulation software is accompanied by a series of computer experiments and exercises that can be used to provide hands-on training. Specific functions that have been developed include modules used widely such as Pitch Detection, Tonality, Harmonicity, Spectral Centroid and the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). This effort is part of a combined research and curriculum program funded by NSF CCLI that aims towards exposing students to advanced multidisciplinary concepts and research in signal processing.",

The paper will present all steps how the temperature logging is made using the LabVIEW programming environment. The analog signal acquisition from the temperature sensor is made using an NI USB-6251 acquisition system. The data is uploaded to online SQL database using the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) Post method. Because the temperature acquisition is used in a photovoltaic system, the logging of the temperature is done every 1 minute during daytime and every 15 minutes during the night. The temperature sensors are used to measure temperature at key parts of the photovoltaic system.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents an agent-based Web-mining approach to Internet shopping. We propose a fuzzy neural network to tackle the uncertainties in practical shopping activities, such as consumer preferences, product specification, product selection, price negotiation, purchase, delivery, after-sales service and evaluation. The fuzzy neural network provides an automatic and autonomous product classification and selection scheme to support fuzzy decision making by integrating fuzzy logic technology and the backpropagation feed forward neural network. In addition, a new visual data model is introduced to overcome the limitations of the current Web browsers that lack flexibility for customers to view products from different perspectives. Such a model also extends the conventional data warehouse schema to deal with intensive data volumes and complex transformations with a high degree of flexibility for multiperspective visualization and morphing capability in an interactive environment. Furthermore, an agent development tool named \"Aglet\" is used as a programming framework for system implementation. The integration of dynamic object visualization, interactive user interface and data mining decision support provides an effective technique to close the gap between the \"real world\" and the \"cyber world\" from a business perspective. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach for Web-based business transactions.",

Recently, they have been considered a hallmark of Web 2.0 technologies, placing the end user on a developer role and encouraging both collaboration and reuse. Following the increasing efforts in investigating new approaches to network management, mashups present themselves as a technology that can bring several advantages to the field. However, to this date, the usage of mashups in network management remains unexplored. Therefore, the present paper approaches this subject, proposing a Mashup Development Tool to network management. We discuss both the architecture of such system and a proof of concept prototype. We them employ our prototype to address the case study of integrating Autonomous System routing information.",

        "Abstract": "Data that measures individual programmer performance was gathered over a 12-year period in a stable work group responsible for developing and supporting a single 4.2-million-line-code operating system including associated program products, compilers, communication systems, and database systems. Analysis shows a wide variation in productivity from best- to poorest-performing individuals. A single programmer out of a workforce of almost 200 did Eight percent of the work. A variation of 200:1 separated the top programmer from the poorest performers. The top 27% of programmers did 78% of the work. This paper updates and comments on the original 1994 paper, answering questions that readers have raised in the intervening years. The prior paper had a wide following: 240,000 IEEE Xplore citations and 8900 web hits. The programming environment was stable and uniform over the time period: education, training, general ability level, work environment, development tools, and methodology were all the same or similar. The development lab was remote from company headquarters and thus largely isolated from outside distractions and influences. Programmers typically were concurrently responsible for both maintenance of existing code and development of new functions, often for the same code module(s). The average productivity of the group is several times higher than industry averages and this fact is demonstrably not caused by excessive documentation or verbose code; both were efficient in comparison to similar systems. The wide variation in productivity is apparently due to individual ability. Training, tools, methodology, and education, while important, cannot make up for individual ability. To get an accurate project plan the extremely wide range of variation in individual productivity must be taken into account. A project can only be on time and on budget if the widely varying abilities of the staff are taken into account. One person, 2 people, or 20 people depending on individual ability may properly staff a project.",

The new Toolbox provides well-known functionality for spatial mathematics (homogeneous transformations, quaternions, triple angles and twists), trajectories, kinematics (zeroth to second order), dynamics and a rich assortment of robot models. In addition, we’ve taken the opportunity to add new capabilities such as branched mechanisms, collision checking, URDF import, and interfaces to ROS. With familiar, simple yet powerful functions; the clarity of Python syntax; but without the complexity of ROS; users from beginner to advanced will find this a powerful open-source toolset for ongoing robotics education and research.",

        "Abstract": "Green computing has emerged as a hot topic leading to a need to understand energy consumption of computations. This need also extends to devices with limited resources as are common in the internet of things. RESTful services have shown their potential on such devices, but there are many choices of frameworks for their development and execution. Current research has analysed performance of the frameworks but no attention has been given to systematically studying their power consumption. In this paper we analyse the execution behaviour and power consumption of web services on devices with limited resources and make initial observations that should influence future development of web service frameworks. Specifically, we conduct experiments comparing web services in the Axis2 and CXF frameworks analysing the respective performance and power consumption. Bringing together the best features of small devices and SoC, it is possible to provide diverse, mobile and green applications — however careful selection of development environments can make significant differences in performance and energy consumption.",

        "Abstract": "Semantic Web Services (SWS) purports to extend traditional Web services with semantic descriptions - leading to services that are machine processable and interpretable. To date, the implementation of semantic services has remained minute both in academia and industry. This is commonly attributed to barriers, such as the complex and heterogeneous semantic description languages, and a lack of mature methods and unified tools that aim to facilitate the development of such services. Moreover, the current solutions that assert to facilitate the development of semantic services are fragmented (i.e. developers are required to use a combination of disconnected tools to realize semantic services). This usually leads to a number of challenges, such as prolonged service development time. Furthermore, existing semantic service development platforms are tightly-coupled to specific semantic description languages, leading to restrictive development environments. This paper proposes a generic and unified approach for designing and developing semantic web services exploiting the Eclipse platform. The key is in using common techniques such as UML - for modelling a variety of semantic services' artefacts, and Acceleo - for automatic code generations of semantic services' artefacts. The main contributions in the proposed solution are: (1) support for the specification and generation of semantic services using multiple semantic description languages, (2) seamless modelling and development of services within a unified environment, and (3) minimization of the barriers associated with the development of semantic services through complexity hiding; decoupling; and extensibility.",

Though commonly employed in industry, manual exploratory testing of web application GUIs was proven to be mundane and expensive. Gamification applied to that kind of testing activity has the potential to overcome its limitations, though no empirical research has explored this area yet. Goal: Collect preliminary insights on how gamification, when performed by novice testers, affects the effectiveness, efficiency, test case realism, and user experience in exploratory testing of web applications. Method: Common gamification features augment an existing exploratory testing tool: Final Score with Leaderboard, Injected Bugs, Progress Bar, and Exploration Highlights. The original tool and the gamified version are then compared in an experiment involving 144 participants. User experience is elicited using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire instrument. Results: Statistical analysis identified several significant differences for metrics that represent the effectiveness and efficiency of tests showing an improvement in coverage when they were developed with gamification. Additionally, user experience is improved with gamification. Conclusions: Gamification of exploratory testing has a tangible effect on how testers create test cases for web applications. While the results are mixed, the effects are most beneficial and interesting and warrant more research in the future. Further research shall be aimed at confirming the presented results in the context of state-of-the-art testing tools and real-world development environments.",

        "Abstract": "Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems challenges implementing programming logic controller (PLC) real-time technology. Firstly, the design of IIoT is fragmented and distributed. Secondly, existing PLC tools are hard to meet and dramatically complicated in emergent industries. Most of all, the deployment of IIoT is state-of-the-art engineering in complexity. A scheme to integrate the GRAFCET virtual machine (GVM) with a digital twin proposed enables IIoT systems in rapidly changing environments. They are compiling digital logic programs that support GVM at remote locations, deploying distributed manufacturing systems through IIoT communication networks, and building operational models of digital virtual and physical systems through digital twin modeling. Its behavior in dynamic operating environments is predictable. The results show that GRAFCET is not only IEC 60848 standard but also IEC 61131–3 for the PLCopen programming tool. Furthermore, a gateway of GVM performs rapid deployment of edge-cloud PLC programming. Significantly a cyber-physical system (CPS) through the digital twin improves the practicality of the digital transformation of PLC's value.",

Native Client aims to give browser-based applications the computational performance of native applications without compromising safety. Native Client uses software fault isolation and a secure runtime to direct system interaction and side effects through interfaces managed by Native Client. Native Client provides operating system portability for binary code while supporting performance-oriented features generally absent from Web application programming environments, such as thread support, instruction set extensions such as SSE, and use of compiler intrinsics and hand-coded assembler. We combine these properties in an open architecture that encourages community review and 3rd-party tools.",

Comparing with previous programming comprehension studies that are usually in controlled settings or have a small number of participants, we perform a more realistic investigation of program comprehension activities. To do this, we extend our ActivitySpace framework to collect and analyze Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) data across many applications (not just the IDEs). We collect 3,148 working hour data from 78 professional developers in a field study. We follow Minelli et al.'s approach to assign developers' activities into four categories: navigation, editing, comprehension, and other. Then we measure comprehension time by calculating the time that developers spend on program comprehension. We find that on average developers spend ~58% of their time on program comprehension activities, and that they frequently use web browsers and document editors to perform program comprehension activities. We also investigate the impact of programming language, developers' experience, and project phase on the time that is spent on program comprehension.",

        "Abstract": "JavaScript is a vital programming language for web applications and it is becoming more important as it is being adopted for developing mobile and desktop applications. Many JavaScript applications are making use of Ajax requests to communicate with remote servers to fulfill its intended purpose. The use of Ajax requests in JavaScript results in two main issues, traditional type checking in other programming languages is not available in JavaScript and JavaScript application does not know what APIs the remote server serves. In this paper, we will introduce a novel tool called Ajax Validator to solve some of the consequences of the mentioned issues. We will use Swagger to validate Ajax requests against their specifications in terms of Local Ajax HTTP Method and Body consistency, Local Ajax HTTP Method and Remote HTTP Method consistency, and Local and Remote HTTP Headers consistency. To evaluate our tool, we obtained 666 swagger specifications for different API providers using the GURU project and nine JavaScript applications from GitHub. From the nine JavaScript Applications, our results showed that eight applications were locally consistent, and one was not. Five applications were remotely consistent, one was not and three of them were not applicable to the validator checking, due to syntax errors or non-matching paths in the Swagger specification. Regarding the header validation, one application was missing two headers in one of its Ajax requests that were specified in the Swagger specification. Also, the same Ajax request specified three headers that were not expected by the Swagger specification. Allowing IDEs to have such Ajax requests checking capabilities in static time will help in reducing the testing costs as long as reducing the runtime errors that a developer could face and fix.",

        "Abstract": "This paper is published in Journal of Empirical Software Engineering (DOI: 10.1007/s10664-017-9547-8). Studying developers' behavior is crucial for designing effective techniques and tools to support developers' daily work. However, there are two challenges in collecting and analyzing developers' behavior data. First, instrumenting many software tools commonly used in real work settings (e.g., IDEs, web browsers) is difficult and requires significant resources. Second, the collected behavior data consist of low-level and fine-grained event sequences, which must be abstracted into high-level development activities for further analysis. To address these two challenges, we first use our ActivitySpace framework to improve the generalizability of the data collection. Then, we propose a Condition Random Field (CRF) based approach to segment and label the developers' low-level actions into a set of basic, yet meaningful development activities. To evaluate our proposed approach, we deploy the ActivitySpace framework in an industry partner's company and collect the real working data from ten professional developers' one-week work. We conduct an experiment with the collected data and a small number of initial human-labeled training data using the CRF model and the other three baselines (i.e., a heuristic-rules based method, a SVM classifier, and a random weighted classifier). The proposed CRF model achieves better performance (i.e., 0.728 accuracy and 0.672 macro-averaged F1-score) than the other three baselines.",

        "Abstract": "Robot manipulators are described geometrically by their Denavit-Hartenberg parameters table. This article describes a package that combines recently developed Internet-based programming tools to generate three-dimensional virtual models of robot manipulators from a DH parameter table. Robot-Draw combines hypertext markup language (HTML), practical extraction and report language (PERL), and virtual reality modeling language (VRML). Internet users can generate three-dimensional robot manipulator models on their computer screens, navigate around the robot model and examine it from any angle. The package was designed as a visualization aid in robotics education and allows educators and students to easily visualize robotic structures and directly evaluate the effect of a parameter variation on the overall robot. Robot-Draw can also be a useful tool in the structural design of robot manipulators. Users with Internet connections can use the University of West Florida Robot-Draw package at the UWF Electrical Engineering web server by connecting to http://uwf.edu/ece/robotdraw.htm.",

        "Abstract": "SaaS (Software as a Service) is software that provides the necessary service only when actually required. On the other hand, PaaS (Platform as a Service) is a platform where integrated software development is executed using the networked environment. SaaS for developers is supported by version control systems or forums. However, these services do not support deployment. Therefore, users need to use other services (like PaaS). We propose a development environment service, in which development and deployment are integrated. In this paper, we propose a development and deployment service in the Educational Cloud. The integrated system is referred to as Development as a Service (DEVaaS), which describes the system. This system currently supports a bug tracking system, continuous integration system, version control system, several well-known programming languages, an editor, and deployment environments in the cloud.",

        "Abstract": "Traditionally, multimedia delivery on the Internet has concentrated on providing a single service quality, \"best effort\", where all types of media are given the same level of importance in a network. Only recently has there been an emphasis on monitoring bandwidth in a network, and adjusting service quality depending on the current bandwidth. One important aspect on which little research has been done is: \"how can users specify the requirements and priorities by which multimedia quality should be adjusted given bandwidth limitations\"? We design a quality of service (QoS) specification strategy and delivery criteria using adaptive bandwidth monitoring that best fits the specifications to the available resources. In order to provide QoS-based delivery a prioritization method has been designed to order information according to the preferences of a user. Java applets and CGI programming tools are used to provide an interactive Web retrieval environment. At present, JPEG quality, resolution and delay are used as parameters to determine the QoS. We are extending the work to include video delivery and distributed implementation with QoS in the future.",

In this context, we propose to design and build a mobile application for the management of a patient's medical data on the Cloud. In this paper, we define the medical record in a comprehensive manner and then present the mobile applications as well as the mobile operating system used, the Android system. The proposed work is composed of two parts; firstly, we choose UML formalism to model our application. Our choice was based on its simplicity, performance and design readiness. Secondly, in order to achieve this mobile application, we used the Java programming language under the Android Studio development environment, and when implementing our application's data storage space, we used XML for data structure and Cloud Computing as a storage space for its security and to protect the patient's privacy.",

        "Abstract": "The cloud provides a flexible environment for customers to host and process their information. Many applications dealing with massive data and complex queries are routed to the cloud. The response time depends on query optimization and resource scheduling. There are several techniques to optimize the query and resource scheduling but the information about the query is not stored i.e. the frequent queries will recursively do the same set of procedures. Hence, to reduce the time consumed by redundant query processing procedure we introduce agents in Hadoop framework (JobTracker). As JobTracker is a single point of failure i.e. if this goes down, all running jobs are halted. Therefore, we introduce agents in place of JobTracker to intellectually process the query and assign the task to TaskTrackers. Here we use FIPA-OS (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents) toolkit enabling rapid development interacting agent based system in the JADE (Java Agent Development Environment) platform.",

Because of the challenges in programming such architectures, realizing this promise has proved to be difficult. In this paper, we describe the design of Lagniappe, a programming environment that simplifies the design of portable, high-throughput applications on multi-* architectures. Lagniappe uses a hybrid programming model: it combines a procedural specification (e.g., in C++) of the basic operators for processing requests with a declarative specification - expressed using a model-driven development framework - of the various features of the operators and the target hardware platform. Using the declarative specification, the Lagniappe programming environment automates the mapping of applications onto the multi-* platform, performs dynamic allocation of resources to operators, and ensures efficient and coherent accesses to persistent, shared state.",

Much of the research spawned by the introduction of Java is in the area of metacomputing, where projects that utilise the distributed capabilities of the World Wide Web are becoming more frequent. WebCom is one such system that implements a framework to harness these distributed resources. Although WebCom supports different models of computation, by incorporating them as distinct modular components, an implicitly parallel graph-based model is used. Visual programming tools for simulation steering are employed allowing the creation, submission and dynamic manipulation of programs.",

        "Abstract": "Currently, front-end web developers spend countless hours overcoming programming challenges while debugging unexpected asynchronous behaviors, writing code to interact with a framework's API, or fixing faults. Such problems demand rethinking programming tools, and for that, we systematically analyzed 301 posts from Stack Overflow, and sought to identify the programming activities developers struggled with and find information barriers that were the primary cause of their challenges. Our results reveal that developers most commonly post questions to change behavior of existing code. Further, specific discussions or changes in code fragments that conceptually have the same intention (e.g. both document.querySelector(“x”) and $(“x”) retrieve references from the DOM), often presented reoccurring challenges that demanded different reasoning to obtain equivalent runtime information (e.g. check if a DOM reference matches what is intended in the output). Code idioms are those concepts underlying patterns in code and by categorizing them, we were able to associate their challenges to execution information barriers that prevent developers from observing relevant state and behavior at runtime (e.g. mapping a DOM reference in a code fragment to its element in the output), and selection barriers that prevent developers from finding or choosing the correct object, method, or parameter values to achieve a desired behavior (e.g. generating code that references a DOM element).",

        "Abstract": "Based on a statement by the General Election Commission of the Republic of Indonesia, 190.022.169 voters will vote in the 2024 election. With a very large number of voters and TPS, this manual recapitulation process raises several problems. As an effort to overcome this problem, an electronic election recapitulation system application is raised to become one of the solutions to be used at the 2024 election. An important part of this application is a scalable backend system. This paper aims to provide a design and also build a backend system that is able to serve every request well. Aspects that are considered in this application are database schemes and flow and implementation at the application level, and application deployment environment to support application performance in dealing with large numbers of requests, but mainly focuses on the aspects of load testing and cost analysis of the deployment environments. The solution that was successfully developed is an application using the Golang programming language connected to the PostgreSQL database and deployed both server-based and serverless Kubernetes on Alibaba Cloud and Google Cloud. After the system has been built, load testing is carried out to test the system's ability to deal with many requests at the same time. The results of load testing show that the system has been able to serve peak requests similar to what will be encountered on election day or regional elections in 2024 with variations in results for each different development environment.",

For transferring data between controller and view XML is very suitable. And to transform it into final form it's better to use XSLT. XSLT is not very popular among developers, because they think this is just yet another “strange” language, without any real advantage comparing to usual languages. But advantages are real - XSLT allows for very interesting results, not possible with other templating languages. It definitely worth studying and this is not hard.",

Therefore, program development regarding the IoT is becoming a field that attracts researchers and teachers to explore. However, low-level programming tools are often used in the learning process, which are not always user-friendly for beginners. Therefore, this study proposes a set of visual environmental analysis systems of self-directed learning courses to write instructions by dragging and dropping building blocks to reduce beginners’ learning obstacles. Additionally, this system uses the concept of self-directed learning in the study design. As such, we expect it to assist students in adjusting their learning speed to make learning personalized and reduce the situation of different states during unified learning. Moreover, this system also records all data detected. It presents the charts drawn after data analysis through web pages to increase students’ mastery of environmental changes at various time points. This study designed a complete experiment to explore the differences in the learning effects of this system on students.",

        "Abstract": "E-learning refers to the way by which the learning content is provided by means of electronic technology. E-learning system is classified as either synchronous or asynchronous. It is the effective learning process so that the Web-based learning system has become a promising paradigm in education. Agent based E-learning can manage the information overload, serve as academic experts, and create programming environments for the learners. There are several characteristics specific to E-learning system such as Interaction, Personalization, Adaptation, Intelligence, Interoperability, Accessibility and Security. Agent based architecture for E-learning system provides the above mentioned features to support instructional design, to retrieve relevant learning materials, to process and analyze data to enable meaningful E-learning recommendations to instructors and learners. But most of the existing E-learning architectures doesn't consider all the features in a single system. So there is a need for a generic architecture that should support all the features to make the E-learning system more efficient. In this paper, we provide a generic architecture for E-learning system. This architecture considers interactivity, personalization, adaptation, interoperability, collaboration, security to enhance the quality of learning process.",

        "Abstract": "Having taught software development at tertiary level for the past 20 years, the author has found that one of the key concepts that students struggle with is to progress from programming basic constructs like FOR-loops to solving real engineering problems. Once students have mastered the basic programming constructs they fall into the rut of the cookiecutters due to the lack of “seeing” the bridge between theory and practice or in this case construct and application. At Tshwane University of Technology the focus is on vocational training and solving this dilemma is key to the University's mission. Having exhausted efforts in promoting the philosophy of Logical Thinking, Analyzing Sequential Actions and Visual Programming Environments a new initiative in sustainable engineering training is making new inroads to addressing this issue. A new visual simulated virtual world has been created where students now have to write control software to manipulate items within this virtual world. Access to the simulated world can either be through a computer terminal connected to the World Wide Web or through an application running on an Android platform. Together with an artificial intelligent tutoring platform the engagement of students with the virtual world is showing that students are crossing over to become programmers of note and no longer mere cookie-cutters.",

        "Abstract": "Context: Client-side JavaScript is widely used in web applications to improve user-interactivity and minimize client-server communications. Unfortunately, web applications are prone to JavaScript faults. While prior studies have demonstrated the prevalence of these faults, no attempts have been made to determine their root causes and consequences. Objective: The goal of our study is to understand the root causes and impact of JavaScript faults and how the results can impact JavaScript programmers, testers and tool developers. Method: We perform an empirical study of 317 bug reports from 12 bug repositories. The bug reports are thoroughly examined to classify and extract information about the fault's cause (the error) and consequence (the failure and impact). Result: The majority (65%) of JavaScript faults are DOM-related, meaning they are caused by faulty interactions of the JavaScript code with the Document Object Model (DOM). Further, 80% of the highest impact JavaScript faults are DOM-related. Finally, most JavaScript faults originate from programmer mistakes committed in the JavaScript code itself, as opposed to other web application components such as the server-side or HTML code. Conclusion: Given the prevalence of DOM-related faults, JavaScript programmers need development tools that can help them reason about the DOM. Also, testers should prioritize detection of DOM-related faults as most high impact faults belong to this category. Finally, developers can use the error patterns we found to design more powerful static analysis tools for JavaScript.",

        "Abstract": "This paper defines a service-oriented solution architecture for n-tier applications (SANTA), primarily for Web-based distributed systems. Most conventional Internet applications have been built on three tiers - Web, application, and database tiers as described in the predominant 3-tier architectural style on both Java EE and .Net platforms. However, a number of leading-edge technologies have matured, which need to be incorporated into the logical solution architecture, such as portal, process choreography, business rule engine, enterprise service bus, Web services, service composition, etc. A new service-oriented model is proposed in this paper, to extend the traditional 3-tier architectural style and position the emerging technologies/products in the right places in the architecture structure. This new architecture model comprises a stack of six interrelated layers, coupled with six vertical pillars. The six layers are access & integration, business process, composite services, services & components, integration & communications, and enterprise resources layer. The runtime infrastructure pillars are composed of the operational management, security, and hosting environment pillar, whereas the development process pillars consist of the application & service frameworks, crosscutting aspects & patterns, and modeling & development tools pillar. This holistic application architecture framework is a systematic taxonomy of major technical constituents of a distributed application in a service-oriented paradigm. Part of this comprehensive model has been extensively utilized in one form or another to design various SOA solutions in different industry sectors",

        "Abstract": "Social coding platforms such as GitHub have become defacto environments for collaborative programming and open source. When these platforms do not support specific cognitive styles, they create barriers to programming for some populations. Research shows that the cognitive styles typically favored by women are often unsupported, creating barriers to entry for woman newcomers. In this paper, we use the GenderMag method to evaluate GitHub to find cognitive style-specific inclusivity bugs. We redesigned the \"buggy\" GitHub features through a web browser plugin, which we evaluated through a between-subjects experiment (n=75). Our results indicate that the changes to the interface improve users' performance and self-efficacy, mainly for individuals with cognitive styles more common to women. Our results can inspire designers of social coding platforms and software engineering tools to produce more inclusive development environments.General Abstract—Diversity is an important aspect of society. One form of diversity is cognitive diversity—differences in cognitive styles, which helps generate a diversity of thoughts. Unfortunately, software tools often do not support different cognitive styles (e.g., learning styles), disproportionately impacting those whose styles are not supported. These individuals pay a cognitive \"tax\" each time they use the tools. In this work, we found \"inclusivity bugs\" in GitHub, a social coding platform. We then redesigned these buggy features and evaluated them with users. Our results show that the redesign makes it easier for the group of individuals whose cognitive styles were unsupported in the original design, with the percentage of completed tasks rising from 67% to 95% for this group.",

From smart cities to smart watches, modern industries are increasingly supporting the Internet-of-Things (IoT). SysMART aims at making supermarkets smart, productive, and with a touch of modern lifestyle. While similar implementations to improve the shopping experience exists, they tend mainly to replace the shopping activity at the store with online shopping. Although online shopping reduces time and effort, it deprives customers from enjoying the experience. SysMART relies on cutting-edge devices and technology to simplify and reduce the time required during grocery shopping inside the supermarket. In addition, the system monitors and maintains perishable products in good condition suitable for human consumption. SysMART is built using state-of-the-art technologies that support rapid prototyping and precision data acquisition. The selected development environment is Lab Viewwith its world-class interfacing libraries. The paper comprises a detailed system description, development strategy, interface design, software engineering, and a thorough analysis and evaluation.",

This system is to deal with difficulties in applying 3D information system in virtual reality experience, which is written in Extensible-3D (X3D) and Java. In order to achieve an accurate 3D representation, the process was divided in phases to better structure and fundament such development: historical data gathering and analysis; 3D modeling and; interactive immersive visualization. Due to the nature of this project, different people from different areas of expertise were involved, working together in a unified development environment. It is our opinion that the online design review has achieved its objectives. However we identified some features that would improve collaboration such as digital 3D annotation and support for online collaboration in current X3D browsers.",

        "Abstract": "This article proposes an efficient quantum train engine (EQuaTE), a novel development tool for quantum neural network (QNN) autonomous driving software, which plots gradient variances to confirm whether the QNN falls into local minima situations (called barren plateaus). Based on this runtime visualization, the stability and feasibility of QNN-based software can be tested during runtime operations of autonomous driving functionalities. This software testing of a QNN via dynamic analysis is essentially required due to undetermined probabilistic qubit states during runtime operations. Furthermore, an EQuaTE is capable of visual feedback because the barren plateaus can be identified at local autonomous driving platforms, and the corresponding information will be visualized at remotely connected cloud. Based on this visualized information at the cloud, the QNN, which is also stored at cloud, should be automatically reorganized and retrained for eliminating barren plateaus. Then, the trained parameters can be downloaded into the QNN of autonomous driving platforms.",

        "Abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in Canada. There are identified incentives to the transfer of breast cancer follow-up care to family physicians after primary treatment has been completed by oncologists at the tertiary care centers. This paper presents a semantic web approach to develop a clinical decision support system to support family physicians to provide breast cancer follow-up care. Our approach involved the computerization and execution of a breast cancer follow-up clinical practice guideline. The computerization of the clinical practice guideline led to the development of a breast cancer ontology. We present our breast cancer ontology which models the knowledge inherent within the breast cancer follow-up clinical practice guideline - the breast cancer ontology serves as the knowledge source to determine patient-specific recommendations. In this paper, we discuss the ontology engineering process that highlights the specification of our breast cancer ontology in terms of clinical concepts and the relationships between the concepts expressed as OWL classes and properties, using the protege ontology development tool.",

        "Abstract": "As video cameras proliferate, the ability to scalably capture and search their data becomes important. Scalability is improved by performing video analytics on cloudlets at the edge of the Internet, and only shipping extracted index information and meta-data to the cloud. In this setting, we describe interactive data exploration (IDE), which refers to human-in-the-loop content-based retrospective search using predicates that may not have been part of any prior indexing. We also describe a new technique called just-in-time indexing (JITI) that improves response times in IDE.",

This mobile app is a map wherein you can track your current location, browse over the directories of the campus and trace the shortest and possible routes to your destination inside the university[1]. And to satisfy the users more, we added the News and Updates feature, to keep them updated on the latest events and happenings in the university [2]. The application is a navigation app, so we apply GPS to acquire location data. Since the map data from Mapbox is outdated and not detailed, we integrated an OpenStreetMap to enhance the map layout. Then through a local database, we stored the latitude, longitude, zoom, and bearing of each building to place a marker on their position. Just like most of the other mobile applications, the Android Studio is the development tool of the project.",

The development tool intended for carrying out experiments in the field of artificial intelligence and it is based on multi-agent technology. In addition, the toolkit will be the maximum possible reuse of elements (tasks, processes, etc.). The basis for the development is the idea of combining, within the framework of one tool, both the real execution of the algorithm by the robot, and its simulation. It allows talking about testing partially implemented hardware (sensors and actuators). Development is carried out based on open source technology; all texts of programs are available at web source: https://github.com/unclesal/tenguai.",

        "Abstract": "In the fashion industry, good trend prediction is the key to success for both manufacturers and retailers. Currently, the speed at which the industry is working is faster than ever before. The Colour forecasting process in many fashion organizations is not visible to the public. A forecasting method is proposed in this study to provide colour trends to industries in advance. Predicting colour trends would allow retailers to improve their logistics for the storage/shipping of clothes. This research proposes a systematic prediction model to forecast colour quickly and cost-effectively in real-time data. This research examines the colour forecasting process, its methodology, and how it is presented and used in the fashion industry. This study used Machine Learning (ML) to examine image data from the latest fashion trends to collect data via web-scraping images, extracting colours from images using k-means algorithms, and assessing the most trending 45 colours. We feed trendy clothing colours from different Pakistani brand websites to the algorithm. The algorithm predicts the frequency of each colour to either be positive or negative in the future. This research uses a forecasting model like ARIMA to forecast colour trends. Furthermore, the mean squared error is quite low, at 0.025. As a result, the current intelligent prediction system meets the criteria for capturing colour in trends for organizations. It would be a good development tool to maximize the profits of fashion companies and minimize the loss. Furthermore, it enables industries to make decisions for selecting colour trends.",

        "Abstract": "This paper has a description of a new approach for finding the solution of economic dispatch problem using Fuzzy sets. The objective of the economic dispatch is to minimize the cost of generation. This solution has another objective for risk term, which represents uncertainties in the operation. The risk term is represented by Taguchi's loss function. A multi-objective formulation of the solution using Fuzzy sets is given here. The solution of the multi-objective economic dispatch based on Fuzzy sets, is performed using programming tools and results are presented, here. Next, the second objective for the risk term may be represented using Map-reduce method. The map-reduce method is a common term in context to Big data. Using this method for representing risk term in economic dispatch problem, is a novel strategy, which is described here. Lastly, the computation of risk term using graph algorithms is given and using a classification method of machine learning in the strategy is discussed. This strategy presented here, provides a tool to represent the economic dispatch problem as a multi-objective problem with objectives of cost and risk. The use of machine learning methods helps for its applicability in recent smart-grid scenario, where cloud-computing and Big data have significant impact.",

        "Abstract": "5G networks are highly distributed, built on an open service-based architecture that requires multi-vendor hardware and software development environments, all of which create a high attack surface in the 5G networks than other proprietary fixed-function networks. Besides that, cloud-native architectures also present new security challenges. Cloud-native separates monolithic virtual machines into microservice pods, resulting in higher volumes of signaling and communication flowing through and between microservices. In addition, secure connections in monolithic applications have been replaced by untrusted communication between microservice pods, requiring additional cybersecurity capabilities. Access control systems were created to provide reliability and limit access to an organization’s assets. However, due to technology's constant evolution and dynamicity, these conventional security systems lack the security to protect an organization’s information because they were created to address access control for known users. For 5G based cloud native technology, these access controls need to be taken further by implementing a Zero Trust model to secure one’s essential assets for all users within the system. Zero Trust is implemented in an access control system under the concept \"Never Trust, Always Verify\". In this paper, we implement zero trust as a factor within access control systems by combining the principles of access control systems and zero-trust security by factoring in the user’s historical behavior and recommendations into the mix.",

In particular, novice programmers waste a lot of time finding bugs, so a feedback system to support debugging is required. Although existing editors and IDEs support finding syntax errors, their functions for detecting logical errors are limited. In the present paper, we present bug detection methods for the feedback system of an online judge system which contains many programming problems and accumulates numerous lines of solution source code. The proposed method uses the solutions and a language model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for bug detection. In addition, since LSTM networks have some hyperparameters, we investigate the best model for bug detection in terms of perplexity and training time. The results of experiments show that models trained by solutions can detect bugs in a compiled code based on the static structure of a program.",

In the method, the cooperation between stationary and mobile agents is used to make more efficiency. The meta-search engine gives the user needed documents based on the multi-stage mechanism. The merge of the results obtained from the search engines in the network is done in parallel. Using a reduction parallel algorithm, the efficiency of this method is increased. Furthermore, a feedback mechanism gives the meta-search engine the user's suggestions about the found documents, which leads to a new query using a genetic algorithm. In the new search stage, more relevant documents are given to the user. The practical experiments were performed in Aglets programming environment. The results achieved from these experiments confirm the efficiency and adaptability of the method",

A number of trends under the broad banner of crowdsourcing are beginning to fundamentally disrupt the way in which software is engineered. Programmers increasingly rely on crowdsourced knowledge and code, as they look to Q&A sites for answers or use code from publicly posted snippets. Programmers play, compete, and learn with the crowd, engaging in programming competitions and puzzles with crowds of programmers. Online IDEs make possible radically new forms of collaboration, allowing developers to synchronously program with crowds of distributed programmers. Programmers' reputation is increasingly visible on Q&A sites and public code repositories, opening new possibilities in how developers find jobs and companies identify talent. Crowds of non-programmers increasingly participate in development, usability testing software or even constructing specifications while playing games. Crowdfunding democratizes choices about which software is built, broadening the software which might be feasibly constructed. Approaches for crowd development seek to microtask software development, dramatically increasing participation in open source by enabling software projects to be built through casual, transient work. The 4th International Workshop on CrowdSourcing in Software Engineering (CSI-SE) seeks to understand how crowdsourcing is shaping and disrupting software development, shedding light on the opportunities and challenges. We encourage submissions of studies, systems, and techniques relevant to the application of crowdsourcing (broadly construed) to software engineering.",

        "Abstract": "Composed image retrieval (CIR) is an emerging and challenging research task that combines two modalities, a reference image, and a modification text, into one query to retrieve the target image. In online shopping scenarios, the user would use the modification text as feedback to describe the difference between the reference and the desired image. In order to handle the task, there must be two main problems needed to be addressed. One is the localization problem: how to precisely find those spatial areas of the image mentioned by the text. The other is the modification problem: how to effectively modify the image semantics based on the text. However, existing methods merely fuse information coarsely from the two-modality, while the accurate spatial and semantic correspondence between these two heterogeneous features tends to be neglected. Therefore, image details cannot be precisely located and modified. To this end, we consider integrating information from the two modalities more accurately from spatial and semantic aspects. Thus, we propose an end-to-end framework for the CIR task, which contains three key components, i.e., Multi-level Collaborative Localization module (MCL), Differential Semantics Discrimination module (DSD), and Image Difference Enhancement constraints (IDE). Specifically, to solve the localization problem, MCL precisely locates the text to the image areas by collaboratively using text positioning information on multiple image layers. For the modification problem, DSD builds a distribution to evaluate the modification possibility of each image semantic dimension, and IDE effectively learns the modification patterns of text against image embedding based on the distribution. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance against the SOTA methods.",

SwhFS provides a POSIX filesystem view of Software Heritage, the largest public archive of software source code and version control system (VCS) development history. Using SwhFS, developers can quickly \"checkout\" any of the 2 billion commits archived by Software Heritage, even after they disappear from their previous known location and without incurring the performance cost of repository cloning. SwhFS works across unrelated repositories and different VCS technologies. Other source code artifacts archived by Software Heritage (individual source code files and trees, releases, and branches) can also be accessed using common programming tools and custom scripts, as if they were locally available. A screencast of SwhFS is available online at dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4531411.",

The approach is based on a two-step redesign process: first a semi-automatic reverse modeling phase analyzes the html pages of the application front-end to abstract a model of the “as-is” design, according to the UWA formalism; second, a forward design phase starts from the recovered models and the (new) requirements available for the application to identify lacks and opportunities of improvements in the “as-is” design and produce the “to-be” version of it. The reverse modeling phase applies clustering and clone detection techniques and is supported by an Eclipse IDE environment. The forward design phase is supported by a set of UWA modeling tools which are built on top of the Eclipse Graphical Editing Framework (GEF) and of the Eclipse Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF) and that allow developers to evolve the recovered models. The results from a concrete case study to assess the validity of the redesign approach are also presented and discussed.",

        "Abstract": "When comparing digital board games with their traditional counterparts, it becomes clear that certain features such as graphics, mundane task automation or saving and restoring the state of the game have been greatly improved.Nonetheless, the transition to a digital environment leads to a loss of the flexibility that makes traditional board games inherently popular. While modifying aspects of the game is straight forward in traditional board games, achieving such a level of customization in the digital domain requires deep knowledge of and access to the game source code. In this paper we focus on board games and by means of an in-depth online survey we validate our previous observation, namely that enhancements should be made to digital board games by incorporating gaming facets found in the physical environment,e.g. support for flexibility by means of house rules. To this end,we introduce a conceptual model for the design of digital board games, which is supported by a set of visual programming tools to enable game development according to the principles set out by our proposed model. The set of the tools along with the underlying intuitive model comprise the FLEXIBLERULES framework, which enables and facilitates flexible and extensible game design and development.",

In this work, hidden text message containing the personal details with different payload (1kbyte to 4kbytes) converted into binary, and then the binary hidden message is embedded into the cover image to obtain stego image. The stego image is transformed using DCST, FDOST, bior2.2, and Haar to produce DCST, FDOST, bior2.2 and Haar coefficients. The hidden message using different keys with the original image is retrieved by applying four different inverse transform methods. LabVIEW programming tools are used for the development of scheme presented and execution of the graphical code for simulation. Finally, the performance of the four methods is analyzed using image quality metrics PSNR and MSE with and without steganography.",

It is a new standard for creating usable and reusable object-oriented simulation components and models. The Silk modeling language is usable because it represents a unique marriage of familiar process-oriented modeling constructs and the powerful object-oriented features of a general purpose programming language. Silk models are reusable because they are created using professional Java visual development environments that support graphical assembly of self-contained Silk modeling components based on the JavaBeans component architecture. Java's adoption as the standard language for computation on the World Wide Web also means that Silk models can be deployed in ways that exploit this new medium.",

Modern agile development environments support this approach by providing tools that automate most of the work required to effectively deal with change, including unit testing and different forms of refactoring. In this paper we discuss how to apply such techniques within the JOpera Visual Composition Language. More precisely, we show how we used the visual language to implement a regression testing framework for compositions written in the language itself and how we introduced support in the visual environment for refactorings such as renaming, synchronization of service interface changes, and extraction/inlining across different levels of nesting. This is done in the context of the Web service composition tools provided with the JOpera for Eclipse research platform.",

        "Abstract": "The lack of development environments for interdisciplinary research conducted on large-scale datasets hampers research at every stage. Projects incur large startup costs as disparate infrastructure is assembled; experimentation slows when software components and environment are mismatched for specific research tasks; and findings are disseminated in forms that are hard to examine, learn from, and reuse. Behind these problems is a common cause - the lack of good tools. When large, heterogeneous and distributed data is added to the equation, further frustration, at the least, ensues. As a result using existing platforms, the programmers of 21st century interactive visualizations are reduced to working in the same fashion with the same tools as 20th century database programmers. Our contribution is to bring the tools of digital artists to bear on the aforementioned data analysis and visualization challenges. Here we report on the current state of progress in adapting Field for large-scale, web-based scientific data analysis and visualization with an emphasis on Linked Open Data [1] and especially the current data hosted by RPI [2].",

        "Abstract": "Currently, object-oriented technology is being widely adopted in multimedia development environments which provide integrated real-time services. Since various user demands cannot be satisfied with the conventional structured development technology, this trend is accelerating. This paper describes an object-oriented approach in constructing a reliable synchronous collaboration environment providing integrated real-time services. The approach utilizes the CORBA framework to support distributed objects and World Wide Web (WWW) technology to handle multimedia data. Also, by extending the real-time transport protocol, the approach supports scalable and reliable transportation of multimedia data. In this paper, we present our approach with a video conferencing system requiring high reliability.",

        "Abstract": "Docker and Vagrant are virtualization containers. Both worlds have their own quirks but each one serves their purpose well. Vagrant, the older brother, uses virtual machines to create isolated environments for software development. On the other side, Docker uses another technique called Containers for isolation and in that term uses local system files and resources. Before those tools, there were so many problems with porting applications, setting them up on other development machines or servers. The problem was that all machines had different setups, some had different versions of required files or they didn't have required extensions. Modern distributed applications development often faces two problems, first problem is inconsistency of development environments because of multiple versions of operating systems and packages and the second one is services and discrepancies between development and test/deployment environments. Virtualization technology, such as virtual machines (VMs) and containers that can handle these problems effectively, but they are often difficult to use in real-world development processes due to the lack of appropriate tools for developers. Modern distributed applications, especially web applications, are typically built using a set of loosely coupled services, with rapid development and deployment cycles. These services may run in multiple virtual machines and are ephemeral according to clients demands. This paper presents both tools, compares them and shows which one of them is the best for which specific use. The purpose of this paper is to show when and why to use which tool and to show advantages and disadvantages of each one.",

        "Abstract": "This article presents an application of real-time control of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) and its integration into Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA). Starting from the operating equations of the PMSM and by implementing the global Field Oriented Control (FOC) control strategy, in which the saturation of the integral component of the PI-type controller is prevented by using an anti-windup technique, the numerical simulations performed in Matlab/Simulink lead to good performance, which recommends the real-time implementation. The numerical simulation step is necessary to choose the type of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) used for the real-time implementation, considering that a global criterion of successful implementation is the performance/cost ratio. Moreover, the integration into SCADA provides flexibility of the control system but also the possibility of online/offline processing from the point of view of other specific requirements. Among them we mention the energy quality analysis, whose first exponent calculated also in real-time is Total Harmonic Distortion (THD). Real-time implementations are performed in Matlab/Simulink and LabVIEW programming environments. According to the trend of the last years, the use of an Internet of Things (IoT) platform for viewing the variables of the control process on the Internet has a special place.",

New online monitoring devices may generate large amounts of data that must be interpreted quickly and accurately. The use of statistical methods and artificial intelligence tools to summarize and interpret high frequency physiologic data such as the electrocardiogram (EKG) are investigated. The development of a methodology and its associated tools for real-time patient data monitoring and diagnosis was accomplished by using the commercial programming environments MATLAB and G2, a real-time knowledge-based system (KBS) development shell. A KBS was developed that incorporates various statistical methods with a rule-based decision system to detect abnormal situations, provide preliminary interpretation and diagnosis, and to report these findings to the physician.",

        "Abstract": "With an increased emphasis on the cyber-physical security of safety-critical industrial control systems, programmable logic controllers have been targeted by both security researchers and attackers as critical assets. Security and verification solutions have been proposed and/or implemented either externally or with limited computational power. Online verification or intrusion detection solutions are typically difficult to implement within the control logic of the programmable logic controller due to the strict timing requirements and limited resources. Recently, there has been an increased advancement in open controller systems where programmable logic controllers are coupled with embedded hypervisors running operating systems with much more computational power. Development environments are provided that allow developers to directly integrate library function calls from the embedded hypervisor into the program scan cycle of the programmable logic controller. In this paper, we leverage these coupled environments to implement online cyber-physical verification solutions directly integrated into the program scan cycle as well as online intrusion detection systems within the embedded hypervisor. This novel approach allows advanced security and verification solutions to be directly enforced from within the programmable logic controller program scan cycle. We evaluate the proposed solutions on a commercial-off-the-shelf Siemens product.",

        "Abstract": "Mapping rice area is a critical resource planning task in many South Asia countries where rice is the primary crop. Remote-sensing-based methods typically rely on domain knowledge, such as crop calendar and crop phenology, and supervised classification with ground truth samples. Applying such methods on Google Earth engine (GEE) has been proven effective, especially at large scale owing to the comprehensive and up-to-date data catalog and massive server-side processing power. However, writing scripts through the code editor requires users to program in JavaScript and understand GEE application programming interface (API), which can be challenging for many researchers. Thus, this article presents a GEE-based web application that aims to eliminate the programming requirements for data selection, preprocessing, and visualizations so that users can easily produce rice maps and refine ground truth collections through intuitive graphical user interfaces (GUI). This software includes three submodule apps, namely the ground truth collection app, threshold-based rice mapping app, and classification-based rice mapping app. Users can customize data processing flow using GUI designed with Bootstrap, and the backend server uses GEE Python API, and a Google service account for authentication to execute the workflow on Google cloud servers. The experiment shows that both the overall accuracy and Kappa scores of the mapping result are higher than 0.9, which suggests that RiceMapEngine can significantly reduce the complexity and time costs it takes to produce the accurate rice area maps and meet the demands of real-world stakeholders.",

        "Abstract": "Given the recent difficulty in continuing the classic CMOS manufacturing density and power scaling curves, also known as Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling, respectively, we find that modern complex system architectures are increasingly relying upon accelerators in order to optimize the placement of specific computational workloads. In addition, large-scale computing infrastructures utilized in HPC, data intensive computing, and cloud computing must rely almost exclusively upon commodity device architectures provided by third-party manufacturers. The end result being a final system architecture that lacks specificity for the target software workload. At the same time, there is a trend in the FPGA space of much larger FPGAs with a lot more resources and hardened IP blocks, making this type of architecture design space exploration much easier. The OpenSoC System Architect infrastructure combines several open source design tools and methodologies into a central infrastructure for designing, developing, and verifying the necessary hardware and software modules required to implement application-specific processors for use in FPGAs. The end result is an infrastructure that permits rapid development and deployment of application-specific accelerators and softcores, including a fully functional software development tool chain.",

        "Abstract": "Cloud computing has been growing at an increasing rate over the last few years. Commercial and scientific applications have come to rely on it as a development tool due to its exceptional characteristics in processing power and storage. The trend has been augmented with the emergence of the Internet of Things and smart processing devices at the edge. Contrary to the line of thought commonly adopted, we present in this work an alternative platform that considers edge devices as possible processing nodes, and provide a two-level task scheduling deployment that can handle not only binary module s, but also code-level fragmentations. We also go through a simple implementation of the platform, using production-ready solutions, while validating it on public and private clouds, and physically-separated edge devices.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate data acquisition and processing is important to analyze the experimental results and research the theories of grain drying. Experiments of grain drying in a deep fixed-bed usually have characteristics of long period, difficult dynamic signal acquisition, large amount of experimental data and cockamamie data processing, etc. Aiming at the disadvantages of tiresome procedure, low efficiency and big error which exist in the traditional manual record and data processing mode for test process, an automatic multiparameters collecting and processing system for the experiments of grain drying in a deep fixed-bed is developed. The system mainly consists of two parts: testing software of master computer, hardware and software of slave computer. A microcontroller is used as the central control unit of the slave computer. Both design of the hardware interface circuit and the data acquisition program have been accomplished. Analog signals of sensors are collected and sent to the master computer by serial communication mode. Software of data processing and analysis used for the master computer operation is developed by using software development tool Excel and VBA on the base of software engineering method, theories of grain drying and experimental design method. The software can automatically analyze and process the regulate control parameters of drying air temperature, drying air velocity, humidity, paddy thickness and intermittent drying time, which were all collected and sent by the slave computer system,and then it can give regression equations and graphics of influence laws of each regulate control parameter on paddy rice dried-quality( additional crack percentage, drying homogeneous degree and drying time, etc.) automatically by applying the function modules of regression analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) and parameterization drawing, etc. A series of paddy drying experiments including single-factor experiments and quadratic orthogonal rotary combination experiments in a deep fixed-bed were conducted with the developed system. The results showed that the system works stably and reliably by compared with the traditional manual record, while labor intensity and interference on data processing of manual operation cloud be decreased during the drying experimental study, and data analysis precision and reliability of experiments also be improved.",

        "Abstract": "A retail store management system is a retail store that uses stock management and orders through the basket by adding a function to classify products from images to facilitate customers and create competitive efficiency for traditional retailers. Product classification is used to improve the performance of traditional retailers by classifying products within a modern retail store by using deep learning on product images to create a model for mobile applications. The best model is selected by comparing the results from learning and evaluating models based on MobileNetV2, VGG16, CNN, InceptionV3 and ResNet. Then, mobile applications have developed by using the best model to support product management for modern retailers. In a mobile application for modern retail management, there are users consisting of retailers and customers, whose functions include stock arrangement, shopping cart arrangement, and product classification. A mobile application is developed by implementing Flutter with the Dart language. It is a cross-platform mobile application development tool that uses Firestore as a database on the Firebase cloud.The results of the five models, it was found that the MobileNet, VGG16, CNN, InceptionV3 and ResNet models validity were 92.80, 80.79, 55.67, 49.68, and 04.59 respectively. The model with the highest accuracy was developed as a system for modern retail stores. The system has been tested for 6 months. The retailers 1, 2 and 3 have the highest number of products sold in the 1st, 6th, and 4th months, respectively.",

        "Abstract": "The move from face-to-face to distance learning poses a challenge for courses that rely on hands-on experience such as embedded systems. In this course, students need to work with hardware and software to achieve various learning objectives. For full advantage, the hands-on experience should be aligned with the acquisition of related concepts and procedural knowledge. The alignment of conceptual learning with hands-on experience is a big challenge, in general, and for distance learning, in particular. This article describes how different learning technologies can be integrated to achieve such alignment for embedded systems in a distance learning mode. A framework for active, lecture-free learning was established using a learning management system, YouTube, various web resources, a hardware kit, and a software development environment. The learning activities were implemented as ungraded quizzes on Moodle with different types of questions. These include review questions, conceptual questions, procedural questions, brainstorming questions, code analysis questions, and code creation questions. Our students used the provided hardware kit and the software development environment to complete the learning activities throughout the semester without listening to any live or recorded lecture from our end. This instructional design was evaluated by analyzing learning data generated by Moodle as well as self-report data. The results show high student engagement and positive perceptions of the course content and the learning method. We believe that the proposed pedagogical framework of this design is of general value and can be adopted in other engineering courses with similar requirements of hands-on experience in distance learning.",

        "Abstract": "A priori information regarding the land cover in remote sensing applications is critical to the effectiveness of the results yielded by the analysis, particularly in complex terrain. Mostly, such information is estimated from spectral indices using either, software with heavy pre-requirements on the machines, or by introducing programmable codes using different programming languages, or other development tools. This paper intends to introduce and demonstrate the details of a simple tool “Ppmask” to generate pre-processing masks for generalized remote sensing analysis of land cover in mountainous regions. The tool yields cloud and cloud shadow masks irrespective of the existence of thermal bands in the source imagery. Further, the tool is capable of extracting several spectral indices and corresponding land cover masks based on these indices. The applicability of the tool is demonstrated using data sets of Landsat-8 and Sentine1-2 imagery. To assess the quality of masks, a comparison is made with the results from the ”Fmask” algorithm for cloud and shadow masks. Another assessment is made by comparison of land cover masks generated by the utility “Ppmask” for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery.",

The detection circuit will be implemented using BISTER configuration. We have configured the Block Under Test (BUT) with a pseudo-delay independent asynchronous element. Since we have exploited the concept of asynchronous element known as Muller-C element in order to detect the fault, the fault has high ingredient of delay dependent properties due to variation of the feedback path delay. Xilinx Jbits 3.0 API (Application Program Interface) is used to implement the BISTER structure in the FPGA. By using Jbits, we can reconfigure dynamically the device, in which the partial bit stream only affects part of the device. In the comparison to the traditional FPGA development tool (ISE), Jbits is faster to map the specific portion of the circuit to a specific tile. We also have more controllability over the utilization of internal resources of FPGA, so that we can perform this partial reconfiguration.",

This approach leads to decrease attention and interest among students due to having no interaction. Game is a relatively new tool to serve educational purposes. However, there is little research dedicated to massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) developed for educational purposes. This research provides a conceptual framework for MMORPGs in education and empowers students to be more engaged in the learning processes. Therefore, a survey analysis is conducted to determine students' perception about effectiveness of MMORPGs and the required features of a game development tool. It also helped to establish learning possibilities and solutions that can be incorporated into a university program from these tools in order to invigorate creative talents of students. It is expected that the findings of survey analysis can help to create more dynamic interactions between students and lecturers, and improve content instruction via MMORPGs. Both lecturers and students teach and learn in a new way, forming a more creative environment to allow a more productive communication between students and lecturers.",

        "Abstract": "Vector Calculus is an important topic in a typical engineering mathematics curriculum. Acquiring both conceptual and procedural knowledge in this abstract topic is required to understand and apply relevant techniques in solving engineering problems. With the objective of bridging the gap between conceptual and procedural elements in vector calculus a set of e-learning aide with visual representation of the involved abstract concepts has been developed. Effectiveness of such tools is enhanced if it is capable of serving students with varied learning modalities. To accomplish that, interactive elements are included in the design of the e-learning content, promoting experiential learning in students. Factors considered in the development tool include the simplicity of adoption of the aids through integration with online learning management system. The context of adopting the platform in a particular course and the qualitative assessment through student feedback, on the effectiveness of the developed learning tools are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Under the background of big data, network data presents a complex and multi structural feature. In the computer network, clustering is the key feature of big data hiding in heterogeneous network. In a word, the data chain in the network is more compact, and the data link between structures is more evacuation. As an important network data application method and traditional data development tool, clustering algorithm has been widely used in academia and society. Based on this, a parallel clustering algorithm for feature hiding big data in heterogeneous networks is proposed. On the premise of establishing the fuzzy equivalent constraint Association of hidden data, the heterogeneous measurement of mixed data is calculated, and online clustering is realized by reconstructing data structure. The experimental results show that the parallel clustering algorithm designed in this paper can achieve good clustering results in data sets, and can measure the differences between data and classes more accurately and reasonably. The new algorithm overcomes the shortcomings of traditional clustering algorithm which classifies attributes according to the overall size of data set or the dispersion degree within the cluster. Compared with other data clustering algorithms, the algorithm proposed in this paper has higher practicability and higher clustering quality.",

As this technology continues to develop, the numbers of agents that comprise a system and their usage of computing resources are both likely to grow. Distributed agent platforms such as JADE (Java Agent Development framework) provide a partial solution to such scalability issues. The emergence of infrastructure as a service (IAAS) cloud computing environments which allow the dynamic scaling of resources provides us with new ways of harnessing the distributed nature of multi-agent systems and their development environments. In this paper we introduce Elastic-JADE, the aim of which is to allow a local JADE platform to automatically scale up and down using Amazon EC2 resources when the local platform is heavily loaded. This paper describes the system architecture, a prototype and comments on future directions that this work may take.",

        "Abstract": "WSBPEL opens up the possibility of applying a range of formal techniques to the verification of Web service behaviors from two points of view: constraints between activities within the same process and dependencies between activities of different processes. In a previous work, we have described an approach for the verification of Web service compositions defined by a set of BPEL processes. The key aspect of such a verification task is the model adopted for representing the communications among the services participating to the composition. In this paper, we propose to extend this approach to handle dependencies between activities of different process orchestrations through message exchanges. Our aim is to enable supporting models of service choreography with multiple interacting Web services compositions, from the perspective of a collaborative distributed composition development environment. The process of behavior analysis moves from a single local process to that of modelling and analyzing the behavior of multiple processes across composition domains.",

FaaS provides a significant business value proposition to users and offloads the security issues of the platform to the provider. The user is responsible for the security of their implementation. FaaS application implementations are typically subject to OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities and require corresponding security controls. For simple implementations this is straightforward. For large FaaS applications, strong process and operational controls combined with automation are necessary to provide reasonable assurance of application security during the development and deployment process. Without these controls, particularly in DevOps/continuous development environments, maintaining security can be problematic. The issue and control approaches are reviewed.",

This paper introduces \"Cyclops\": a web-browser-based IDE that facilitates the development of embedded applications on the Beaglebone Black's PRU. Users write PRU code in a simple JavaScript-inspired language, which Cyclops converts to PRU assembly code and deploys to the PRU. Cyclops automatically configures the Beaglebone's pinmux controller to use common I/O peripherals like ADC and PWM.

        "Abstract": "A prototype of a remote lab for providing cloud computer resources in optimal manner to achieve an infrastructure lab service is discussed. It has the ability to offer training sessions for different operating systems and networking techniques that are used to build hybrid IT infrastructure solutions. Topologies consisting of machine servers equipped with different operating systems such as Linux, Windows, Solaris etc. that are coupled with each other through different network components and devices, presents an IT infrastructure solution. Such a laboratory will solve many of the problems facing students in developing countries, as academic institutions are not equipped with the appropriate platforms and network components for teaching IT. Moreover, IT departments of business enterprises or IT academic institutions will save big amounts of money as there is no necessity to purchase such expensive systems. Currently, the first prototype is being built using VMware ESX server, VMware vSphere client, GNS3, among others. The development environments used have the capability to manage large pools of virtualized computing infrastructure, including software and hardware. The research is also aimed at carrying out a comparative evaluation to measure some pedagogic and usability criteria.",

        "Abstract": "AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML) is a confederation of technologies aimed at providing improved user interaction with web-based applications. While AJAX provides an improved user experience, it also comes with its baggage of problems. The lack of formal semantics makes AJAX applications difficult to build, debug, understand, and validate. Different component technologies of AJAX (e.g., XMLHttpRequest or Javascript) are browser-sensitive and have different implementations and provide distinct functionalities. Source code is downloaded and run on the clients machines, raising security concerns. In this paper, we present an ``AJAX''-like framework in an event-driven secure synchronous programming environment. Our framework is supported by a formal operational semantics. Applications written in our language can be verified using formal static analysis techniques such as theorem proving. The applications are compiled and run on the SINS (Secure Infrastructure for Networked Systems) infrastructure jointly developed in collaboration with the Naval Research Laboratory.",

        "Abstract": "This chapter explains how a user can use network isolation to protect valuable infrastructure resources. It looks at designing networks, creating “safe‐space” sandbox environments, and building virtual walls to more closely control who gets access to specific resources. Firewalls and other network configuration tools can be used to segment his/her resources, reducing risk exposure for vulnerable devices. Multitiered network designs can provide significant protection. Such designs include demilitarized zones, bastion hosts, and networks divided by purpose (development/staging/production). For local infrastructure, isolated development environments are built using traditional physical or virtual networking. Cloud providers offer simpler—and often much cheaper—alternatives for isolation using, as in the case of AWS, distinct virtual private clouds or even organizational accounts for each environment he/she needs. The chapter also describes how OS operation can gain additional security through the use of mandatory access controls.",

        "Abstract": "Block-based programming languages like Scratch support learners by providing high-level constructs that hide details and by preventing syntactically incorrect programs. Questions nevertheless frequently arise: Is this program satisfying the given task? Why is my program not working? To support learners and educators, automated program analysis is needed for answering such questions. While adapting existing analyses to process blocks instead of textual statements is straightforward, the domain of programs controlled by block-based languages like Scratch is very different from traditional programs: In Scratch multiple actors, represented as highly concurrent programs, interact on a graphical stage, controlled by user inputs, and while the block-based program statements look playful, they hide complex mathematical operations that determine visual aspects and movement. Analyzing such programs is further hampered by the absence of clearly defined semantics, often resulting from ad-hoc decisions made by the implementers of the programming environment. To enable program analysis, we define the semantics of Scratch using an intermediate language. Based on this intermediate language, we implement the Bastet program analysis framework for Scratch programs, using concepts from abstract interpretation and software model checking. Like Scratch, Bastet is based on Web technologies, written in TypeScript, and can be executed using NodeJS or even directly in a browser. Evaluation on 279 programs written by children suggests that Bastet offers a practical solution for analysis of Scratch programs, thus enabling applications such as automated hint generation, automated evaluation of learner progress, or automated grading.",

Mincom currently markets a successful product, MIMS (Mincom Information Management System), which is a large, integrated OLTP system consisting of about 16,000 KLOC (kilo-lines of code), mostly COBOL. Our research group is developing prototypes in preparation for migrating MIMS into a distributed architecture. CORBA is our current research focus. This paper examines the limitations of CORBA for current use in enterprise OLTP development. Major concerns include: the lack of a standardised persistence interface for use with major database vendors; the immaturity of the Object Transaction Service and Concurrency Service; the lack of integrated workflow solutions; scalability and robustness; the lack of performance monitoring tools; and poor enterprise development environments. We are optimistic that vendors and the OMG will eventually solve these problems, but feel that it may be a few years before workable commercial solutions are in place.",

This study investigates the application of a number of these technologies and teaching strategies across university courses in OOAD and OOP, using an empirical approach based upon attitudinal and student performance data. The systems used include: development environments that provide two-way linkage between UML diagrams and OO program code; interactive whiteboards to allow educational demonstrations that more closely represent actual practice; and an online delivery tool for course content, messages and discussions. Close integration between the processes of OOAD and OOP courses is also investigated. The approaches significantly improved student grades, perceived levels of understanding and productivity. The integration of course concepts and assignments, and the electronic discussion boards, are key benefit drivers.",

        "Abstract": "The NIST DMC (distributed measurement-and-control) demonstration project that has been described spans all levels of the DMC system. This multilevel data communication capability is a viable one as a result of standardized networks, protocols, and transducer interfaces. Common Internet-based software technology was used to provide the ease of data migration between the various communication pathways. Standard and de facto software languages such as C and Java were used with off-the-shelf development tools to implement the embedded network node applications and the web-based application, respectively. Internet-based TCP/IP protocols and Ethernet technology were used to design the networking infrastructure. The distributed measurement and control concept with networking sensors and actuators should work quite well with advanced system design, particularly where sensor-based monitoring and control applications are important. Taking this approach in system design can reduce the total life-cycle cost of the system by use of modular sensor system design and commercially available smart transducers with standardized interfaces, and easy maintenance and upgrade via simple plug-and-play sensor and actuator components. In addition, using standardized components and interfaces will certainly reduce interoperability problems.",

        "Abstract": "We are developing and extending the CMake family of software development tools (www.cmake.org) for use in the Mobile Network Institute and the Multi-Scale Reactive Modeling Institute. These tools are used to build, test, and package C/C++ and FORTRAN software in a cross platform manner. By using CMake, a software project can be built just as easily on a Windows PC as on a Cray XT5 super computer. In addition, CMake's CTest facility can test and then populate the testing dashboard CDash (www.cdash.org), which is a web-based tool used to monitor and display the “health” of a software system. In combination with CTest, CDash provides a continuous integration testing system. Finally, CPack can be used to package and deploy software across multiple computing platforms. This paper will describe these tools, how they are used in the software process, and provide specific application of their usage in support of Multi-Scale Reactive Modeling (MSRM) and the Mobile Network Modeling (MNM) High Performance Computing Software Applications Institute. The tools described in this paper are open source and available to any high performance computing (HPC) project. The paper will provide a high level overview of the CMake tools with enough specifics to enable any HPC development effort to begin working with them. We will also describe how these tools and the associated software process provide the computational infrastructure required to rapidly develop next generation HPC software.",

        "Abstract": "A new remote laboratory system for learning hardware designs and experiment of digital circuits has been developed. Wide use of the Internet motivated us to develop seamless remote and actual hardware laboratories for hardware design laboratory course. Unlike existing virtual laboratories, the proposed remote laboratory utilizes actual hardware and actual measurement tools in a time sharing fashion. Hardware experimental environment is usually treated as an exclusive resource, for single user usage. However, the actual test run time is rather short and most of the time is wasted leaving those precious resources idle. To make those resources operate more efficiently, it employs shared resources and enhanced service management scheme based on the Web services. It finds an available service site and schedules the executable processing. The combinatorial use of FPGA/PC connected test hardware and PC based measurement equipments such as logic analyzer or pattern generator has make it possible to develop a remote multi-user time sharing hardware experiment system, where students at remote sites can perform actual experiments using actual hardware equipments and tools concurrently. As all students are equipped with high performance laptop PCs, CPU intensive tasks such as development of the digital circuits for FPGA can be off-loaded from the server host and can be performed by each student's client PC. A floating license scheme allows students through the Internet to utilize commercial FPGA development tools. Thus, we created virtual private network to access the floating license server over firewalls. Such a rich client configuration allows the server to concentrate on the service management tasks, such as hardware resource managements. The prototype system is scheduled to be used for the third grade CS students from year 2005.",

The target systems of this development process are web based information systems running on a J2EE platform. The automation and optimization of that process was achieved by the application of model driven techniques, mainly the integration of development tools via a Meta Object Facility (MOF) repository backbone.The internal evaluation of NTT Data pointed out a development effort and time reduction of more than 50%. The main lessons learned form this case include the necessity of model-to-model transformations, the need to preserve advantage of existing development process and tools landscape, the requirements to care about configuration and change management from the beginning and the requirements to support also non modeling tools. Also, we identified a new business role, which is that of a tool and process integrator.",

This paper presents the methodology used to design several web-based simulation tools for undergraduate topics in digital design and computer organization and architecture. It discusses the design criteria common to all projects, as well as such logistical items as development tools and student support. This paper also discusses simulation tools for a computer system, a microprocessor, and a programmable logic device, which were developed using this methodology.

GitHub includes development tools such as issue tracking (bug reports and feature requests), notifications, diffs, and status dashboards; as well as social features. There are three options for documenting a project in GitHub: Readmes, a wiki, and GitHub Pages. All of these options can be authored in Markdown syntax. Because docs are stored in the same repository as code, they can follow the same workflow, which is especially useful in an Agile environment.",

IoT has already been leveraged by many industries and it will be extensively used very soon. Automated emergency alert system is one such application which can commercially scale and can achieve high operating efficiency when integrated with IoT. In this paper, an end-to-end architecture of an intruder alert system has been proposed. The proposed work uses MQTT protocol and web development tools like MEAN. The merits of using these protocols over other protocols and tools in resource constrained IoT applications were discussed. Finally, the real-time implementation of the proposed architecture has been demonstrated.",

On the technological front, the main driving forces are powerful operating systems, the widespread availability database management systems, a wide selection of libraries, interoperability standards, versatile programming languages, ample processing power, and sophisticated development tools. On the environment front, agility is driven by specialized education, informal management structures, Web access, open source software, shifting user expectations, and the ubiquitous availability of IT infrastructures. Where agility drivers are present, we must adjust our development processes, demand more from our software suppliers, and develop in-house capacity to organically grow applications and services that will delight and even captivate our users and customers.",

        "Abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach towards designing a Computer Vision (CV) based low cost and self sustained intelligent flood early warning system named AquaEye, keeping in view the annual damage floods inflict to the people of Pakistan. The traditional SONAR based system deployed at various places is an expensive solution which needed dedicated supervision. AquaEye uses commercial off the shelf components and open source web dashboard development tools as the key elements of its design. It takes real time image of the water level on sites, computes it through a CV blobs detection technique and sends the water level telemetry encapsulated in an SMS to the main server. The main server is equipped with an intelligent SMS broadcasting system which alerts only those mobile users who are close to the vicinity of flood danger areas. The design proves to be a simple and easy to develop low cost inundation alert system using readily available components.",

        "Abstract": "The digital ecosystem (DE) paradigm is a holistic management/design/integration paradigm that is based on the notion of self-interested, self-managing, proactive and autonomous digital entities that evolve and self-organize. While a DE can be realized using different technologies Web services (WS) are particularly promising due to their widespread acceptance within industry and academia, established and open standards, a wealth of development tools and infrastructures, and maybe most importantly the number of successful deployments. A key issue in the development/deployment of any system is the behaviour exhibited by components (e.g. providers & consumers). Service-oriented systems tend to use a contract approach in which implicit, predefined or negotiated service-level agreements (SLAs) are established between providers and consumers. A SLA defines from a provider's point of view the guaranties, responsibilities and warranties (e.g. availability, reliability, performance, throughput, compensations, etc) towards a consumer. While being conceptually fairly straightforward, SLAs have the unfortunate side effect of forcing providers to use reservation/locking of resources as a means of ensuring their availability should the consumer request them. This in turn leads to the problem of resource underutilization that threatens the efficiency of the service-oriented system. This paper focuses on the use of cooperation between providers and consumers in service ecologies as an alternative to the constraining SLAs. By enabling the consumers and providers to exchange information regarding their current needs and capabilities it becomes possible to better utilize the resources and therefore improve overall system performance.",

The poST language, developed at the Institute of Automation and Electrometry SB RAS, is a language for describing programs for cyber-physical systems implemented on the basis of PLCs. The service allows one to create small programs in the poST language without installing software on the user's side, which simplifies the initial acquaintance of users with the poST language. The service provides checking the syntax and semantics rules of programs and generating ST code and PLCopen XML Exchange format, which can be used in existing IEC 61131-3 development tools such as CoDeSys. The relevance of such a service is substantiated, its graphical interface and functionality are described.",

        "Abstract": "The allocation of cross-border transmission capacities is a basic precondition for cross-border electricity trade. Insufficient transmission capacities are the factor that limits this trade and therefore they must be allocated in the economically efficient manner in order to alleviate its negative influence on the trade but along with the preservation of electric power system stability. The flow-based coordinated auctioning method introduces economic criteria for selection of requests for transmission capacities use when those requests exceed available amounts (congestion), along with a better representation of cross-border electricity transactions influence on transmission network. With the use of Internet development tools, Web simulator has been created, which allowed practical implementation and testing of coordinated auctioning method, especially a possibility to apply netting of counter-flows. Several sensitivity analyses and case studies have been conducted and the results that show the advantages of application of netting principle are elaborated.",

In addition to the analysis and visualization of software systems, it is useful to analyze the software development process to obtain better information about the quality, reliability, and trustworthiness of the software. To gain insights and knowledge about software development processes, we extract the provenance of development processes, especially from version control systems for Git-based software projects, and visualize the provenance information using graph visualization, metrics representation, and development timelines; including an integration of these methods into a web-based dashboard. With the help of visual provenance representations, project managers can gain an overview and insights into development progress, effects of process changes, and interactions among developers and with external contributors, which we exemplify with a case study of a software with high social relevance.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, with the diversified development of education and training in China and the continuous \"Internet +\", enterprises and society have put forward higher requirements for the ability of skilled talents. However, in the vocational specialty colleges that transport a large number of skilled talents, it is increasingly difficult to meet the needs of students' learning and development. At the same time, it is difficult for students to select appropriate content for independent learning in the vast information on the Internet. Hybrid teaching is a teaching mode that combines the advantages of both traditional teaching and networked teaching. The specialty courses teaching system is based on hybrid teaching mode. It uses Java Web technology as the basis for adopting B/S development mode, MySQL database and eclipse, Navicat as Development tools. The research and implementation of the hybrid teaching system is conducive to the school to help bridging the communication between the students and the enterprise, so that students can learn more directly and provide high-skilled talents with basic professional knowledge and skilled skills. On the other hand, through practice, it also helps to promote the development of hybrid teaching reform, thus solving the complexity and particularity of the informationization process in higher vocational colleges.",

        "Abstract": "In this research full paper, we examine students’ improvement in spatial visualization skills when using MYR (short for \"My Reality\"), a browser-based, cloud-hosted programming environment for beginning through advanced programmers to create immersive, three-dimensional virtual reality scenes.The research literature suggests that there is correlation between students’ spatial abilities and their success in programming. In this study, we conducted a three-week (six hour) virtual after-school program which introduced high school students with different programming backgrounds to coding in MYR. During the program, students learned the basics of MYR, introductory CS topics, and completed individual coding projects, creating an original MYR scene.A study examined changes in students’ spatial reasoning as a result of this intervention. The students’ performance in spatial skills was measured using the Revised Purdue Spatial Visualization Test: Visualization of Rotations (Revised PSVT:R) [1]. Students completed this instrument using a pre/post survey design. We analyzed the impact of the intervention using a paired samples T-test. We further developed a rubric for analyzing the sophistication of students’ MYR code and applied it to evaluating the programming expertise of our study participants.The program was hosted twice with two different groups of high school students. Most showed interest in MYR programming and expressed their creativity and learned skills in their original project. With the first group of students, we found increases in their spatial visualization performance after the intervention with MYR, though statistical significance was not reached. The second group of students had higher baseline prior experience in computing and spatial visualization skills; these students did not further increase in their spatial visualization skill.The analysis showed that the MYR has a potential to improve spatial skills and engage students’ interest in computing. We recommend that MYR and related computational environments be further studied and made available to students.",

        "Abstract": "This paper analyzes the optimization design process and implementation method of green building scheme stage based on BIM Technology. From the perspective of BIM Technology, the integrated design mode of green building is proposed, according to its characteristics of visualization, coordination, simulation and optimization risk. In the decision-making model design of building scheme, three objective functions are established from three aspects of building energy consumption, natural lighting and natural ventilation. Then, by combining BIM Technology and Bayesian network, a comprehensive evaluation optimization model is constructed. Through the knowledge component and item evaluation of the above evaluation criteria, the system framework, the system function module and system workflow are determined. At last, we use software engineering related ideas and a variety of software development tools to complete the development of Revit end compliance check plug-in and web end information interaction platform, as well as the application and evaluation of related engineering cases.",

        "Abstract": "The AT&T Advanced Software Construction Center (ASCC) has developed a system that provides a powerful implementation of software reliability engineering (SRE) measurement. The Data Analysis and Representation Engine (DARE) supports quantitative analysis from data definition and collection through to metric calculation, visualization and use. Data input is automated from several vendor software development tools, and a form-based interface assists in data collection from developers. A number of metrics related to SRE are calculated and a metric visualization interface provides access to the graphs and reports via World Wide Web (WWW) browsers. DARE also provides a facility for further data analysis and is integrated with the AT&T Silver Bullet software development processes. This paper describes the design and features of DARE and how it supports SRE.",

        "Abstract": "A Grid environment is a collection of a large number of geographically distributed resources managed by various organizations. And it is considered as a powerful computing infrastructure to solve large and complex problems. To support the software development, until now, many Grid programming languages have been investigated. Most of them use proprietary protocols or TCP-based protocols to communicate. Connectivity, especially the network firewall and the heterogeneous interoperability is one of the big issues for Grid applications and development tools. POP-C++, which is a programming language adding a new type of “parallel object” to C++, also faces the same problem in its communication protocol which heavily based on TCP socket/XDR. This research aims at providing POP-C++ a novel mechanism for objects to choose a suitable protocol and message encoding to communicate among them. Web Services, which is a broadly accepted standard, is a good choice because it is widely used in structuring interactions among distributed software services. Its communications mostly use SOAP buffer over HTTP protocol which is normally allowed in all firewalls. In this paper, we discuss an extension of POP-C++ toward HTTP/SOAP to overcome the connectivity issue.",

The file management information system has realized three functions of service, management and maintenance. A multi-objective differential evolution algorithm based on elite file and reverse learning is proposed. In this algorithm, an external file is established to save the non-dominant solutions in the process of population evolution, and the convergence speed is improved. The test results show that the system can effectively solve the practical problems encountered in the archives management.",

The unknown and fluctuating environment in which pervasive applications are executed discards traditional approaches. As a result, there is an increasing need for a reproducible and dynamic deployment process. In last years, we developed several industrial pervasive platforms and applications. Based on these experiences we propose Rondo, a tool suite for deploying pervasive applications. Rondo includes a domain-specific language for declaratively describing applications, a deployment manager that can dynamically apply these descriptions and development tools for helping the description of applications. In this paper we present this tool suite and a set of deployment scenarios in which we validated our approach, including a web framework and a home automation platform.",

However, it can be difficult to recognize people who are pertinent to our area of expertise quickly in situations like conferences, meet-ups, and workshops. This article outlines the requirement for a system that can improve networking by speedily locating people with pertinent skills. The suggested technology, dubbed “People’s Lens,” uses a face recognition model and Firebase database to scan and recognize people’s faces in business gatherings and determine whether they are experts in a particular field. For the system’s front end, web development tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used, as well as the face-api.js service for face recognition and classification. Additionally, the system scrapes information from the backend database to give the user a summary of the corresponding individual. The proposed system has the potential to make networking at professional meet-ups more efficient, especially when time is limited.",

We have designed and implemented a middleware platform for enabling contextual collaboration, and built collaborative applications on top of the platform. The platform embodies three main themes: on-demand, adaptive, and integrated. It is on-demand in that it allows collaboration data and services to be accessed from within business applications as the business need arises. It is adaptive in that it brings the right set of collaboration elements to the user, in a manner sensitive to business context. It integrates collaboration elements across multiple sources, multiple modalities, and multiple vendor technologies. In addition, it integrates structured collaborative activities with ad hoc peer collaboration tools, and with the business processes at large. To validate and leverage the contextual collaboration platform, we have developed an eclipse-based collaborative development environment and a browser that enables collaborative Web applications. Our contextual collaboration platform and applications promise to yield a more productive and more satisfying business practice.",

        "Abstract": "The Neo-Fuzzy integrated Adaptive Decayed Brain Emotional Learning (NF-ADBEL) network has recently been proposed for online time series predicting problems. The NF-ADBEL network is suitable for online time series prediction with shorter update intervals and offers features such as fast learning, accuracy, simplicity, and lower computational complexity. However, the neo-fuzzy neuron network in NF-ADBEL was integrated only in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) part of the ADBEL network. This paper aims to further improve the performance of the NF-ADBEL network by integrating the neo-fuzzy neuron network into the amygdala (AMY) section as well, inspired by a fully integrated version of a neo-fuzzy-based pattern recognizer. As is known, the AMY has two outputs: one response is based on imprecise information received from the thalamus, and the second response is based on information received from the sensory cortex. In this study, the imprecise response generation is operated as previously, while the other AMY process is treated by neo-fuzzy neurons. The resultant network is called Expanded Neo-Fuzzy integrated Adaptive Decayed Brain Emotional Learning (ENF-ADBEL). The modified network is still simple and meets the requirement for online prediction problems. A few chaotic and stochastic nonlinear systems, namely the Mackey-Glass, Lorenz, Rossler, disturbance storm time index, Narendra dynamic plant identification, wind speed and wind power series, are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed network in terms of the root mean squared error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient (COR) criteria in a MATLAB programming environment.",

        "Abstract": "Full Paper Research-to-Practice The current COVID-19 crisis has created significant challenges for schools. The growing importance of “flipping the classroom” and the needful emphasizing of online-learning were owed to the situation. To meet these requirements, materials and tasks must be adapted. The Open Educational Resource (OER) textbook “Computational Thinking with the BBC micro:bit” was developed for the introduction of Computational Thinking (CT) for 10-14-year-old pupils in Austria's secondary schools. Example tasks in the textbook are designed with an open end and present extensions with ideas for further development instead of ending abruptly. This article provides a guideline for a clear distinction in redesigning existing lessons following the Inverted Classroom Model (ICM) using videos for pre-class work and live task extensions for in-class work. Which parts in the learning design must remain as live lessons and which parts can be adapted for video lessons? The respective research shows that examples that have a makerspace activity as an extension are especially helpful for an efficient determination of the appropriate part in the learning design and particularly suitable for an adaptation with ICM. The central advantage of the ICM is that it responds flexibly to the individual learning needs of each student. It allows students to take their time reviewing the material at their own pace without getting left behind. The textbook used here encourages pupils to find their own solutions by explorative learning using the block-based programming environment MakeCode. Additional information to be uncovered by the learner is provided for every single step in the accompanying online wiki website. Results from observations showed that this uncover-function, being a central element of the online material, encouraged the learners to explore their own way in finding a solution with playful elements and increased motivation. The many haptic elements of a makerspace activity are in particular useful for consolidation of the learned and are predisposed for in-class work and deepening the understanding following the constructionism theory. A Design-Based Research (DBR) approach is used to create and evaluate the redesign of a proven example task in a pilot project. Teachers, who are already familiar with the BBC micro:bit and the OER textbook, were trained on how to use the “flip-version” of an example task in their lessons and asked to develop a lesson plan for implementation. The didactic approach to redesigning the material and teacher training was evaluated during the first cycle of DBR. Results from expert interviews showed that the redesigned material and training deliver a solid ground for rework and further research on a larger scale.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, online marketplaces have seen a large increase in business. Managing and making sellers' reputations available to buyers is vital for the success of these markets since buyers may be dealing with unknown online sellers. Typically, prospective buyers assess sellers' performance by looking at past buyers' reviews, prior to making a purchase. In current online marketplaces, buyers' reviews are associated with their identities, raising privacy issues. Several decentralized solutions have been proposed using blockchain technologies to solve this problem. However, some of these systems are not entirely decentralized or have some weaknesses such as requiring a trusted third party. In this paper, we propose a system for decentralized reviewing that trades off cost for unlinkability. Using blockchain-based smart contracts, we propose a fully decentralized marketplace to provide reviewers with a secure and trusted platform. Here, buyers can use one-time identities to provide feedback on their transactions. The system also ensures that a review can only be submitted after a transaction is completed, and that at most one review may be submitted per transaction. The system enforces these properties through blockchain technologies and smart contracts. In addition, we propose an innovative approach to encourage buyers to submit reviews. The system has been prototyped using Remix IDE.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we describe COCA -- Computation Offload to Clouds using AOP (aspect-oriented programming). COCA is a programming framework that allows smart phones application developers to offload part of the computation to servers in the cloud easily. COCA works at the source level. By harnessing the power of AOP, COCA inserts appropriate offloading code into the source code of the target application based on the result of static and dynamic profiling. As a proof of concept, we integrate COCA into the Android development environment and fully automate the new build process, making application programming and software maintenance easier. With COCA, mobile applications can now automatically offload part of the computation to the cloud, achieving better performance and longer battery life. Smart phones such as iPhone and Android phones can now easily leverage the immense computing power of the cloud to achieve tasks that were considered difficult before, such as having a more complicated artificial-intelligence engine.",

        "Abstract": "FPGA has recently been deployed in the multi-tenant cloud to provide high-performance computing capabilities. Such deployment of FPGA creates a new attack surface for adversary. It has been recently demonstrated that the capacitive crosstalk between FPGA long-wires can be used as a side-channel to extract secret information. In this paper, we present HILL: a Hardware Isolation framework against information Leakage on multi-tenant FPGA Long-wires. As a defense framework, HILL can prioritize the placement and routing of security-critical hardware instances and isolate them from other parts and tenants. For data and communication interfaces that use FPGA long-wires, such as UART, PCIe, and AXI4, HILL employs a long-wire obfuscation technique to reduce the side-channel leakage. We evaluate the performance of HILL with Xilinx Artix-7 FPGAs using two prevalent FPGA development tools: Xilinx ISE 14.7 and Vivado 2018.3. The experimental results demonstrate that HILL can effectively reduce the crosstalk-caused side-channel leakage by 138 times. The long-wire obfuscation technique reduces the correlation between the side-channel leakage and secret key from 81.7% to 50.3%, which is close to random guess.",

        "Abstract": "The field of cloud computing has been evolving rapidly since inception. Cloud is the virtual pool of resources which can be served to the user through SaaS, PaaS and IaaS flavours. No cloud can be existed without virtualization. With Virtual Machine, the bare metal is virtualized to run multiple Operating System instances. These VMs serve to the users for performing the tasks. All are independent units and user has complete ownership and control to install the required softwares and use as per the wish. The VM solves many problems by optimizing the resources. The developers concern that the code is working fine on the development environment, but fail to work on testing or production environment due to the environment differences, if any. So, the Containerization comes into the picture to address such challenges. In this paper, various aspects of Containerization are explored and highlighted. The Container runtime environment-Docker and Container orchestration tool-Kubernetes are focused and deployed for exploring the possibilities of Containerization adoption, which automate the Container deployment, scaling and load balancing.",

        "Abstract": "In this multi-screen world, we spend most of our time shifting through devices from desktops to laptops, tablets, and smart phones, in different modes, sequentially and simultaneously. Orchestration of these learning contents from multiple devices is not an easy task. It is also a fact that there has been an explosive growth of mobile devices and practically every learner nowadays has a mobile device. This represents an immense potential for learning purposes. Mobile learning is undoubtedly not e-learning on mobiles. Expecting all e-learning courses designed for desktops to work equally well on mobiles is against the basic thinking of ubiquitous learning, since each of these devices is perfected for different needs, and possesses unique features. Presently, most of the rapid e-learning development tools in the market do not support responsive design. The aim of this research has been to develop a responsive mobile learning application and to investigate on its ability to provide content adaptation based on certain conditions such as limited bandwidth. A mechanism has been designed whereby the mobile device can identify the strength of the Internet connection available. The system operates on two metrics; round trip time and bandwidth and using these two metrics, contents to be displayed on the mobile device are eventually adapted. Azure Cloud storage has been used to build this platform. The resulting application is cross-platform and can be run on Android, Windows phone and iOS.",

UML (Unified Modeling Language), though being a set of software development tools, is often used to conceptually model data and relationships. This paper presents a methodical approach to logically and physically model data in MongoDB by utilizing UML conceptual modeling aids. Application of data models greatly impacts performance, scalability and flexibility of data systems. Furthermore, application life-cycle and expansion impact long-term decisions made during modeling. This paper takes into consideration application requirements, access patterns and life-cycle during logical and physical modeling in a cloud environment. The flexibility that a NoSQL modeling paradigm embodies makes logical and physical modeling complex, with no hard-and-fast rules. This paper presents logical and physical modeling concepts required during designing database applications with MongoDB.",

        "Abstract": "Traditionally, most definitions seeking to characterize middleware suggest that it is the software that facilitates remote database access and systems transactions. More recently, the term has come to be associated-somewhat limitingly-with distributed platforms such as the Open Software Foundation's Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) and the Object Management Group's Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA). And some have loosely applied it to systems as diverse as workflow support environments and even to the Web itself. We believe the essential role of middleware is to manage the complexity and heterogeneity of distributed infrastructures and thereby provide a simpler programming environment for distributed-application developers. It is therefore most useful to define middleware as any software layer that is placed above the distributed system's infrastructure-the network OS and APIs-and below the application layer.",

Sapnias et al., June 2000]. In this paper, we describe innovative software extensions on J-DSP to accommodate on-line laboratories for speech processing, image processing, and communications systems. Significant modifications in the object-oriented GUI of J-DSP that enable simulation of feedback systems are also presented. The speech processing functions enable on-line simulations of speech coding algorithms and include PCM and ADPCM quantization as well as more elaborate algorithms such as the LPC and the CELP. Image processing functionalities include development of 2-D signal processing capabilities including 2-D-FFT, 2-D-filter design, and 2-D graphics and picture processing. Communications functionality covers several aspects of analog and digital modulation and demodulation. On-line laboratory exercises have been developed in the aforementioned areas and posted on a web site (http://jdsp.asu.edu). This site also includes on-line evaluation forms for the exercises. Statistical and qualitative evaluations that assess the learning experiences of the students that use J-DSP are presented.",

        "Abstract": "Building an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) from scratch usually requires technological skills, expertise about the domain and tasks, and pedagogical knowledge. We propose a middleware which facilitates the construction of intelligently supported learning systems independently from the underlying (formalized) domain knowledge using typical re-usable components of ITSs, exchangeable plug-ins, and machine learning techniques running in Matlab. We proved our concept using a web-based programming environment as an example of an user interface component interacting with our ITS middleware.",

We also present, RDF triples production methodologies from JSON and JSON-LD data as infrastructure to support the linked open data. For this reason, we propose a related algorithm and its implementation in programming environment, and we are testing this on open data retrieved by the Greek open data repository.

        "Abstract": "In this study, we developed a programming exercise support system that visualizes the coding status of students and presents it to the teachers with the aim of improving lessons. This system provides a Web-based programming environment for students. In addition, for teachers, whether the student's learning status corresponds to going well, stumbling, giving up, or cheating is determined and presented in real time based on the system operation log. Moreover, the progress of each student, the source code creation process, the occurrence of errors, and how well the student is coping with them are also presented. In order to evaluate the usefulness of this system, we conducted a simulated exercise class using a prototype of the system. As a result, it was confirmed that the system is an effective way for teachers to ascertain the progress and coding status of students. However, it was not possible to identify the location and cause of the student's stumbling in real time. Future issues are the accumulation of log data by use with a large number of people, improvement of the accuracy of determining the coding status, establishment of a method for identifying and presenting the stumbling point, and security measures.",

This paper presents an evaluation of JaguarCode, supporting those UML diagrams to investigate its effectiveness and user satisfaction.

Owing to the fact that conventional query languages such as SQL cannot be spoken, there is a need to develop natural-language processors to be used in conjunction with speech interfaces. Ideally, it should be possible for non-programmers to create their own speech-accessible natural-language applications that they can easily add to a SpeechWeb, in a similar manner to the creation of web pages using hunt. The W/AGE programming environment is a step towards this goal.",

        "Abstract": "Heterogeneous distributed computing has traditionally been a problematic undertaking which increases in complexity as heterogeneity increases. The recent advent of Java has made heterogeneous computing a fairly straightforward task. Nevertheless, many researchers have not considered the use of Java in a mainstream parallel programming environment. The performance of Java just-in-time compilers currently approaches optimized C for many applications, making Java a serious contender for supercomputing application development. This paper presents DOGMA (Distributed Object Group Metacomputing Architecture)-a new Java-based system which enables parallel computing on heterogeneous computers. DOGMA provides support for dedicated clusters as well as idle workstations through the use of a Web-based browse-in feature or the DOGMA screen saver, which improves workstation utilization. DOGMA supports parallel programming in both a traditional message-passing form and a novel object-oriented approach. This research provides a unified environment for developing high-performance supercomputing applications on heterogeneous systems.",

In this article, we discussed the application of some programming languages in data processing algorithms, and how to build a mixed programming environment of Java and other languages. By adopting Java and other multi-language mixed programming methods, we have carried out the design of the business logic layer of the integrated platform for the realization of multiple programming languages, which overcomes the lack of support of the Java programming language in data processing algorithm programming. It meets the needs of users who only need to use the integrated platform to quickly run different methods written in multiple languages. Application examples and results show that the method of using Java and other languages to build integrated Web projects is efficient and feasible.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, RPA has been widely used to automate office work. In this study, we use this RPA for playing digital games. The purpose of this research is to utilize the programming techniques used in RPA for game play as teaching materials for programming. As a first step, we examined what areas of programming learning would be possible with gameplay RPA. In recent ICT environments, programming of images and sounds frequently occurs. There are also many opportunities to use Web API and machine learning libraries. We think that it is necessary to create new teaching materials in response to changes in the programming environment. Gameplay RPA will also have a great effect on raising the motivation for learning.",

        "Abstract": "Teachers need to monitor students’ progress in coding classes, which becomes difficult when there are many students. In this study, we developed a programming exercise support system that presents students’ coding status to the teachers with the aim of improving lessons. This system provides a Web-based programming environment for students. The system accumulates the exercise numbers that students work on as operation logs, as well as the operations and results of editing, building, execution, and testing programs. In addition, it presents teachers with each student’s progress, the source code creation process, and the occurrence of errors. This system consists of functions for students, instructors in charge of seminars and teaching assistants, and course chiefs. The system currently only focuses on C language. Approximately 230 students used this system for seven weeks on two subjects taught in class. The number of logs varied from day to day, thousands to over 100,000 logs were collected and accumulated per day. Based on user comments, we evaluated the system from five viewpoints of FURPS (Functionality, Usability, Reliability, Performance, Supportability). It was confirmed that the function of \"ascertaining the student's coding status,\" which is the purpose of this research, was achieved. Teachers can use the insights provided by our system to guide students in real time.",

        "Abstract": "Visual programming (VP) is increasingly used for educational purposes thanks to its user-friendly nature. However, there is also a clear need to take into consideration the teacher objectives and the different students needs. In fact, in practice, students have different levels, some of them have some difficulties, and they are also progressing differently. To deal with all these constraints, we propose \"Studio4Education\" (S4E), a novel web and desktop based visual programming environment for the development and deployment of IoT applications. Moreover, we integrated S4E with a model driven workbench (Eclipse Papyrus) where the teacher specifies an IoT problem for the students using a high level modeling language: Systems Modeling Language (SysML). Then he generates a configuration for S4E from the model to adapt the S4E VP interface to his goals and to the students level. We also demonstrate a seamless integration between these two tools using the Arrowhead framework.",

        "Abstract": "JavaScript has become a general-purpose programming environment that enables complex, media-rich web applications. An increasing number of JavaScript programs are parallelized to run efficiently on today's multicore CPUs, which are capable of dynamic core scaling (DCS) and voltage/frequency scaling (DVFS). However, significant power savings are still left on the table since an operating point (in terms of the number of active cores and CPU voltage/frequency) is selected by monitoring CPU utilization or OS events, without considering the user's performance goal. To address this, we propose QPR.js, a QoS-aware power-optimizing runtime system for JavaScript. Using the QPR.js API, the application developer can specify a QoS goal and provide a fitness function to quantify the current level of QoS. During execution the QPR.js runtime system uses this information to autonomously find an optimal operating point minimizing power consumption while satisfying the QoS goal. Our evaluation with five parallel JavaScript programs demonstrates an average of 35.2% power savings over the Linux Ondemand governor without degrading user experience.",

In its essence, it represents measurement of indicators from the agricultural field and their transmission to a centralized server, then a decision can be made to perform a certain automated action based on the received values. In order to measure these parameters, it is necessary for the systems located in the field to be equipped with the required sensors. In order to transmit data from the various agricultural areas to the remote servers, an appropriate network protocol and transmission medium should be selected. For the further processing of the data and the creation of a web-based system for monitoring of the transmitted parameters, a suitable programming environment should be used for data processing. This report describes the development of a comprehensive system for remote monitoring of agricultural crops.",

        "Abstract": "A two degree of freedom (DOF) light tracking system is presented in this paper. It uses a web camera as a vision sensor, PC sound cards as output signal controllers, and two DC motors as a pan-tilt driver mechanism. The sound card is expected to produce a higher output signal in a PWM form to drive the motors. The motors will react accordingly when they receive the signals to ensure that the camera always focuses on the centroid of the light source. The system used image processing technique to detect and determine the location of the light source and was programmed to send PWM through the sound card to drive the motors to correct the error produced from the light movement. In MATLAB programming environment, a closed-loop control is implemented to provide interaction between camera and sound cards as devices to control the motors to track the light source. The system has been designed and tested with various locations of light source. The data which were obtained by experiments indicate the ability of the proposed controller.",

App Inventor is designed to let students with no previous computing experience explore mobile applications, including communication, location-awareness, social networking, and massive Web-based data collections. One goal of App Inventor to change the nature of introductory computing, to make it less dissociated: more about people and their interactions with others and with the world around them. We want to enable young people - and everyone - to engage the world of mobile services and applications as creators, not just as consumers. This workshop will provide (1) a hands-on introduction to using App Inventor; (2) demonstrations of effective teaching techniques in order to help attendees decide whether and how to offer similar courses; (3) discussions by faculty in the pilot projects of their experiences and their students' work (4) time for general discussion of creating mobile applications as an introduction to computing.",

        "Abstract": "A key retention issue when educating computing novices is ensuring that the frustrations of mastering programming fundamentals do not demotivate and discourage students from studying the discipline. In particular, non-CS majors often struggle to find relevance in traditional computing curricula that tend to either emphasize abstract concepts, focus on non-practical entertainment (e.g., game and animation design), or rely on decontextualized settings. To address these issues, this paper introduces BlockPy, a block-based environment for Python (http://www.blockpy.com). BlockPy is a web-based, open-access programming environment that supports introductory programming with an emphasis on data science. It promotes long-term transfer by scaffolding an introduction to textual programming (Python) through a block-based programming view, ideal for beginners of any background. By supporting the latest Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standards, BlockPy is designed to support both informal learners and formal class settings. Specifically, it can be configured to provide guiding feedback for its interactive programming problems, so as to support learners at their own pace. The results from a pilot study of the initial deployment and utilization of BlockPy indicate the potential of the environment to address many of the problems faced by novice learners.",

        "Abstract": "This paper provides the motivation for the design of a web-based planning tool called AgentDesign, a description of its components, and a discussion of elementary students' ability to use it for creating games. The planning tool presented in this paper was used to engage elementary students in an activity to design and then create a video game using an agent-based programming environment. The design of the planning tool was informed by prior research and literature on concept development. The tool scaffolded the design process by having students (1) describe their game, (2) identify agents, (3) describe agent behavior, and (4) use those descriptions to identify useful algorithms. The set of algorithms used were called computational thinking patterns (CTPs), and sample code was provided for each CTP to assist the programming process. From the information provided by the student a summary was created to show needed agents and helpful programming code.",

        "Abstract": "Learning to program can be very hard. Without an existing background in the subject and without adequate resources, students, especially women, may find themselves experiencing much frustration at their lack of understanding. A ubiquitous usable learning environment, that pictorially depicts run-time information in the form of animated visualisations, could support the learning of some common programming techniques. It would also help provide that previous experience essential to becoming a proficient programmer. This report presents JavanOwl, a Web-based educational programming environment designed to provide all the above.",

        "Abstract": "Time is an important factor to determine the market performance of a product, where accelerating the process of test development is one of the solutions. Probing is involved in most of the process. Hence, designing a system to assist engineers in component searching during probing process is critical. This paper discusses a designed system that consists of a National Instruments embedded board NI sbRIO-9632XT, a movable laser pointer, two stepper motors with limiting switches as sensors attached at origin, and a web-camera for image processing of the location of the Device under Test. A personal computer acts as a host to link the PCB design software - EAGLE and the National Instruments graphical programming environment - LabVIEW by using batch file, and to incorporate them into the hardware. The image processing part is done by LabVIEW Vision Acquisition Software. The designed system is able to detect any printed circuit board (PCB) within a maximum dimension of 182 × 302mm. The system has been tested with promising results. The system is able to locate any electronic component on the PCB which is requested by the user for testing purpose.",

        "Abstract": "The authors have developed a programming exercise system and are already using it in classes. This system provides students with a web-based programming environment, and monitor the time that students worked on exercises, logging operations such as program editing, building, execution, and testing, and their results. For teachers, it also shows how each student is progressing, the source code creation process, and the occurrence of errors. Teachers’ evaluation of these functions is beneficial, but how feedback is given to students is inadequate. In this study, to examine feedback to students, we do a preliminary analysis of the operating log of this system. We used this system in a programming class of about 230 students for 15 weeks, collecting thousands to 100,000 log events such as the number of keystrokes, the number of working hours, the number of exercise programs completed, the number of copies and pastes, etc. per day. We can summarize our results as follows: “The greater the number of keystrokes, working hours, and program completions in class, the better the results”; “The number of keystrokes after the class ends (after the answer example has been published) does not affect the grades”, and similar conclusions. In addition, based on these findings, we can identify conditions that increase the probability of becoming a poor performer.",

The purpose is to discuss some interesting ideas on developing application programs dealing with icon objects. It is shown that Chinese characters are concrete icons, that are representable as webs (decomposition graphs). A grammar that generates these webs is a context-free web grammar, and so a Chinese input simulator is a machine that accepts these webs. Developing such a simulator can be regarded as the construction of an user-defined application program. The authors show that a form-based visual approach can be used to specify the simulation behaviors for defining and evaluating icon-based Chinese input methods, although the visual objects dealt with are concrete icons.<>",

What are the benefits, problems, and tools needed-what can the research community do to help? In this paper, we describe a research agenda aimed at understanding the motivations and issues of software development blogging. We interviewed developers as well as mined and analyzed their blog posts. For this initial study, we selected developers from various backgrounds: IDE plugin development, mobile development, and web development. We found that developers used blogging for a variety of functions such as documentation, technology discussion, and announcing progress. They were motivated by a variety of reasons such as personal branding, knowledge retention, and feedback. Among the challenges for blog authors identified in our initial study, we found primitive tool support, difficulty recreating and recalling recent development experiences, and management of blog comments. Finally, many developers expressed that the motivations and benefits they received for blogging in public did not directly translate to corporate settings.",

        "Abstract": "Nowadays many farmers have adopted various means in the context of good farming practices to ensure the health of their livestock in good condition and healthy. Failure to ensure the health of livestock would cause to the death of animals and lead to decreased in productivity. Conventional methods by incorporating livestock data information on paper is a huge waste of time and not safe, therefore not effective for a good farming practiced. Hence, the electronic-based livestock management systems are needed to help farmers and livestock veterinary to share information for the purpose of early prevention of dangerous diseases from infected their livestock. In this project, the extensively use of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology for livestock health management in the preparation of animal profile has created a fast and efficient method, but several conditions have to be set such as the RFID frequency selection and numbers of livestock in the farms. In current practice, even though the RFID systems in animal rearing is not a new approach, but this project has successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of RFID technology comes to solve daily problems on farms. In developing this monitoring system, web-based application platform likes MySQL, Apache and JSP has been used in an integrated methods for reporting and recording of livestock health records. Furthermore, Java programming act as a script, MySQL as database and NetBeans IDE 7.2 is used for the development of the whole system. In order to ensure this system development costs can be reduced as much as possible, the RFID Based Livestock Health Management System was built using open source software. The use of laptops and portable RFID reader has made farmers easier to access their livestock health information in real time and then can be shared to the other interested parties.",

The idea builds on the strength of several existing techniques that developers already use for discovering new tools, including screencasts and online social networks.",

This article introduces the design of a wireless sensor network to monitor temperature, moisture, and soil humidity of a greenhouse in real time. To optimize the parameters and use of water, an automated control system is built for handling these microclimate parameters. The advanced sensor node handles the sensor information and causes the actuators based on the programmed microcontroller's (Arduino-based) with a threshold algorithm. The gateway gets data from the sensor and controls data via Blink and sends the data to the remote monitoring Web application. Moreover, this proposed work is simulated by thinker CAD software for initial analyzation of the soil moisture level, temperature, humidity, and light intensity. The controller's codes have been written in the programming language Arduino, debugs, compiled and uploaded into the microcontroller using Arduino's IDE. The system was constructed and tested for a scaled-down prototype. Greenhouse automation provides effective microclimatic parameter acquisition and controls. The work engaged in maintaining it also considerably decreases, making it beneficial for rural farmers, gardeners, and agriculture researchers.",

We present an approach to detect the current activity of software developers and if they are facing a problem. By observing developer actions like changing code or searching the web, we detect whether developers are locating the cause of a problem, searching for a solution, or applying a solution. We model development work as recurring problem solution cycle, detect developer's actions by instrumenting the IDE, translate developer actions to observations using ontologies, and infer developer activities by using Hidden Markov Models. In a preliminary evaluation, our approach was able to correctly detect 72% of all activities. However, a broader more reliable evaluation is still needed.",

        "Abstract": "Clusters have made the jump from lab prototypes to full-fledged production computing platforms. The number variety, and specialized configurations of these machines are increasing dramatically with 32-128 node clusters being commonplace in science labs. The evolving nature of the platform is to target generic PC hardware to specialized functions such as login, compute, Web server file server and a visualization engine. This is the logical extension to the standard login/compute dichotomy of traditional Beowulf clusters. Clearly, these specialized nodes (henceforth \"cluster appliances\") share an immense amount of common configuration and software. What is lacking in many clustering toolkits is the ability to share configuration across appliances and specific hardware (where it should be shared) and differentiate only where needed In the NPACI Rocks cluster distribution, we have developed a configuration infrastructure with well-defined inheritance properties that leverages and builds on de facto standards including: XML (with standard parsers), RedHat Kickstart, HTTP transport, CGI, SQL databases, and graph constructs to easily define cluster appliances. Our approach neither resorts to replication of configuration files nor does it require building a \"golden\" image reference. By relying on this descriptive and programmatic infrastructure and carefully demarking configuration information from the software packages (which is a bit delivery mechanism), we can easily handle the heterogeneity of appliances, easily deal with small hardware differences among particular instances of appliances (such as IDE vs. SCSI), and support large hardware differences (like /spl times/86 vs. IA64) with the same infrastructure. Our mechanism is easily extended to other descriptive infrastructures (such as Solaris Jumpstart as a backend target) and has been proven on over a 100 clusters (with significant hardware and configuration differences among these clusters).",

Electrical energy monitoring system is now using real-time measurement facility via wireless network applications. In this paper we consider an application of star topology wireless sensor network for single phase electricity monitoring system based on Energy Meter IC ADE7753. Zigbee is used as wireless protocol. It has many benefits such as low cost, low power, low data rate, and supports on mesh-networking IEEE 802.15.4. For web-server monitoring system, Ext-JS framework is used as client-side programming which is integrated with IDE Arduino. Statistically, for sample of 30 data measurement, it is shown that current measurement gave guarantee of accuracy value until 5.3μArms with average precision error of 0.03%, and voltage measurement gave guarantee of accuracy value until 226.5μVrms with average precision error of 1.23%. Effectively, data measurement occurs in the intervals of 10 seconds and a transmission maximum of 40 meters with barrier and 60 meters without barrier.",

Students do classwork using an enhanced version of Pythy, a web IDE for Python and Jython, that captures students' work and displays it around the room. We leverage the Microsoft RoomAlive Toolkit to construct a room-scale augmented reality using pairs of projectors and depth cameras. The system “pins” students' work to the walls, where teachers and students can see and discuss the work. We hope that by seeing each other's work, the system will foster collaboration and support the creation of STEM learning experiences that encourage creativity, innovation, and help build strong peer learning environments.",

In this paper, we propose the use of Pull & Push Location Based Service model in experiments of the implementation of Location Based Service environment to lessen the problems faced by Police and Fire Fighters in retrieving accurate information while patrolling high risk area. The time taken and the accuracy of information are problems normally faced by Police and Fire Fighters in Emergency Case department. It is crucial for them to get the right information at the right time to their walkie talkie or mobile phones. We first proposed the usage of RSS as the web services to provide feeds for the smart phone application. Updates on crimes or emergency cases within the users' locations are sent upon users' retrieval or push based on the users' locations. The application is developed by using Eclipse IDE platform and tested using HTC Magic with Android OS. The application flow starts by retrieving the location position and information on emergency cases will then be displayed according to date listed. The conceptual design and architecture are designed for Pull and Push Location Based Services.",

In addition, it's a very toxic gas undetectable by humans, it occurs when a device burns a fuel such as gas, wood, oil and its derivatives, etc. and spreads very quickly inside the homes. This paper presents the design and implementation of IoT prototype for the detection of carbon monoxide based on the WeMos D1 mini board programmed by Arduino IDE software to prevent asphyxiation accidents. IoT technology gives us great capabilities for the development of Web applications that connect the real world to the digital world. In this prototype, we used the MQ-2 gas sensor for detection. When the gas concentration exceeds a first threshold, the system triggers the fan and if the detected value exceeds a second threshold greater than the first, it immediately alerts the users by sending alerts in the form of notifications via the Pushbullet platform.",

        "Abstract": "Software engineering is at the very start of it's automation. There are a lot of helpers, code-generators, IDE-s and so on that does not really help to automate the complete software development life-circle from Functional requirements specification till the actual code. We explore the idea to generate the actual software solution using standard Functional requirements specification, change request or bug-report in three main modules: linguistic, perceiving and solution generation with heavily used knowledge base in OWL (web ontology language).",

        "Abstract": "The Entity Relationship model is the de-facto standard for data modeling and has been in use for a long time already. This popularity also led to the development of various tools that support ER modeling. However, these tools are often inflexible, proprietary, constrained to specific platforms, and lack advanced features like (SQL) code generation. This paper introduces the bigER modeling tool. bigER offers various features for flexibly specifying and visualizing conceptual ER data models. Within the VS Code IDE, the tool enables hybrid and interactive modeling through a textual editor with a custom language to specify ER elements and an accompanying view to display and modify the graphical ER model. The bigER modeling tool is one of the first tools to incorporate the Language Server Protocol and to be distributed through the VS Code ecosystem. Due to its web technology-based architecture, it is platform-independent and easily extensible.",

        "Abstract": "With the advancement of technology and the dependency of people on phones, it is important to come up with solutions involving technology. Using traditional storage methods, farmers can inhibit the spoilage of onions. But, in some situations, people may fail to notice the spoiled onions and in such a scenario they can depend on technology involving some deep learning algorithms and sensors. In the existing techniques, the system which consists of IoT framework alone faced many challenges because sometimes it may predict the data wrongly due to environmental conditions and leading it to an inefficient technique to detect onion spoilage. To overcome this kind of challenge, it is a must that technology like image processing should be included. This paper discusses the model that was developed using Google Colab IDE, which is based on image processing. Combining the segmentation and object extraction process has improved the image features, as it discards the background and other unnecessary things around the main object in our application. CNN model has got 87% accuracy, this shows a good result after evaluation. After this image processing segment, the work continues with the IoT framework that senses the parameters of onions using esp8266 & sensors, and it displays the stages of spoilage on LCD. Through this system, farmers and retail sellers can get early information about the spoilage of onions by accessing the real-time values through the web page.",

The plan of eye movement controlled electronic wheelchair is to get rid of necessity of the help needed for the disabled person. In order to help the differently abled people, numerous types of interfaces have been advanced for electric wheelchair control such as joysticks controlled, head movement controlled, voice controlled etc., many people with disabilities may find it difficult to operate the chair using the above-mentioned interfaces. It is an idea to make lives of the disabled people easier i.e., independent, which will thereby increase their confidence to move from one place to another. The web camera mounted in front of the user will capture the image of the eye movement. The eye movements as prepared using python open CV and the command are sent to the Node MCUs which is programmed using Arduino IDE, which controls the direction of the wheelchair. Therefore, we have achieved more than 94 % of accuracy in determining the eye direction.",

However, the emphasis of software process is usually on the functionality, whereas the user interaction layer is often considered of minor relevance. This paper presents an approach aimed at the specification of the layer that captures the interaction of the user with the system, through the derivation of analysis abstract models into design models. These models shall then be used as input to source code generation, in the implementation discipline, using a tool integrated to an IDE.",

        "Abstract": "The Fit framework is a widely established tool for automated acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). Fit stores the test specification separate from the test fixture code in an easily human readable and editable tabular form in HTML format. Additional tools like the FitPro plugin or FitN esse support the writing of test specifications and test fixtures from within the Eclipse IDE or the Web. With the increasing popularity of agile test-driven software development, maintenance of the evolving and growing test base has become an important issue. However, there has been no support yet for automated refactoring of Fit test cases. In a recent research project, we developed the Eclipse plugin ReFit for automated refactoring of Fit test cases. Fit test refactoring can occur due to changing requirements or changing Java code, which in either case means a cross-language refactoring to keep test specification and test fixture in sync. In this paper the concept for the development of the ReFit Eclipse Plugin is described, which significantly reduces the effort for Fit test maintenance and makes refactoring less error prone. Besides a tight integration into the existing Eclipse refactoring plugin, major goals of the plugin were to make it easy extensible for additional refactorings, new fixture types and further test specification file formats. Challenges faced when adding new and modifying existing Eclipse refactoring behavior are described and are due to the strong dependency on the Eclipse JDK and LTK features, and the solutions developed are presented.",

In the online environment, any kind of public issues may become a trigger for the generation of public opinion and thus need to be controlled for network supervision. The method in this paper can identify entities from the event texts obtained from mobile Today's Headlines, People's Daily, etc., and informatize security of public opinion in event instances, thus strengthening network supervision and control in mobile, and providing sufficient support for national security event management. In this paper, we present a SW-BiLSTM-CRF model, as well as a model combining the RoBERTa pre-trained model with the classical neural network BiLSTM model. Our experiments show that this approach provided achieves quite good results on Chinese emergency corpus, with accuracy and F1 values of 87.21% and 78.78%, respectively.",

        "Abstract": "Sustainable social and economic programs for aging citizens are needed to address the increase in life expectancy in developed countries. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) services, also known as Active and Health Aging (AHA) services, is a European initiative that promotes a new era of integrated solutions that include hardware, software, and human services. One of the impediments to the adoption of these services is the lack of an economically viable marketplace. The electronic commerce (eCommerce) industry, in which buyers and sellers meet over electronic systems, can facilitate this emerging market of integrated services. We present the concept of an online store for integrated services, which enables users to connect the services available in the store to their development environment and to the infrastructure in which they are deployed, supporting the services full life cycle. This novel market-oriented approach, driven by technology and not by a specific vendor or tailored to a proprietary platform, is expected to radically improve and promote the adoption of these services. The general design approach and architecture of the online store and its capabilities are analyzed, and a specific implementation of a one-stop online shop for AAL services, named uStore, is described in depth.",

        "Abstract": "Bare Machine Computing (BMC) is a paradigm used in programming applications to run on a Bare Machine. It consists of a CPU, Memory, and I/O without an Operating System and resident mass storage. It utilizes an Application Development model software that interfaces directly with the hardware. It also has potential as a powerful teaching and research tool in undergraduate STEM programs, notably Computer Engineering and Computer Science. Before the COVID-19 Pandemic, researchers used the University lab environment, and Bare Systems connected via LAN/WAN. The Pandemic restrictions put members of the research team in different locations. Hence, the researchers adopted a Remote Collaboration model of Concurrent Participation, Communication, and Development for Bare Machine to continue this research. This paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of moving the BMC research entirely online and measures needed to address the Configuration of BMC Development Environment, Communication, Collaboration, and Diverse Skill Set. The paper covers online technical research because most literature concentrates on only online survey research's benefits and drawbacks. This paper also addresses BMC application in presenting STEM subjects to students, mainly undergraduate students. Finally, the paper includes remote research that fulfills the Department of Education (DOE) requirements of student access.",

        "Abstract": "Software visualization can be very useful for answering complex questions that arise in the software development process. Although modern visualization engines offer expressive APIs for building such visualizations, developers often have difficulties to (1) identify a suitable visualization technique to answer their particular development question, and to (2) implement that visualization using the existing APIs. Examples that illustrate the usage of an engine to build concrete visualizations offer a good starting point, but developers may have to traverse long lists of categories and analyze examples one-by-one to find a suitable one. We propose MetaVis, a tool that fills the gap between existing visualization techniques and their practical applications during software development. We classify questions frequently formulated by software developers and for each, based on our expertise, identify suitable visualizations. MetaVis uses tags mined from these questions to offer a tag-iconic cloud-based visualization. Each tag links to suitable visualizations that developers can explore, modify and try out. We present initial results of an implementation of MetaVis in the Pharo programming environment. The tool visualizes 76 developers' questions assigned to 49 visualization examples.",

        "Abstract": "The recent emergence of low-cost single-board computers such as Raspberry Pi and Arduino, which are used as sensing devices with connectivity to the Internet gateways and cloud services, has led to Internet of Things (IoT) architectures in the real world. Visual IoT is one of the classes of IoT that poses crucial end-to-end challenges due to the need for sensing and processing of visual data. One of the significant roles of the visual IoT is information extraction from images by using image processing and image recognition techniques. In this paper, we first introduce a programming environment for visual IoT on Raspberry Pi camera system, and then discuss a couple of sample applications. The first one is an application for real-time information extraction based on Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) and the second one is an augmented reality (AR)-oriented application based on Open Vector Graphic (OpenVG).",

This technology is receiving considerable interest in recent years primarily due to its ability to promote and support scientific collaboration among large distributed research teams. The paper reviews the Scientific Workflows Management Systems (SWMS) field and investigates in detail popular open source workflow systems used commonly in life sciences informatics. Emphasis is placed on features which make these systems attractive for scientific use, e.g. user friendliness, use of distributed resources, reusability, provenance, collaboration, data integration, etc. Our conclusions indicate that although SWMS, including open source ones, have several open issues, their unique features and strong momentum clearly suggest that it is only a matter of time before they are adopted in even more scientific fields.",

It can work in the binocular mode, where the stereo image pair is utilized to reconstruct the 3D point cloud in the common field of view of the two cameras; while in the monocular mode, each single camera and the random pattern projector constitute a measuring unit respectively to alleviate the highlight and occlusion effect. The design and the calibration of the random pattern projector, which is the key ingredient for enabling the system, are discussed in detail. The system algorithms are partially implemented with NVIDIA Graphics Processing Units (GPU) in the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) programming environment, which proves effective to accelerate the computation. Experiments are conducted to validate the precision, rapidity and data integrity of the measurement system.",

Since the launch of AI, many improvements were applied to it, which aimed to increase its effectiveness in promoting programming education for beginners. In our workshop, which targeted high school female students, we taught mobile programming using the improved version of AI2 (a free cloud-based tool). Thus, in this paper, we will describe our experience in using AI2 in our workshop, how it helped in our teaching method and discuss the improvements and limitations we observed over the previous version of the tool. We will also show the activities provided to the students and the mobile apps that were created using AI2. The final apps as well as the survey results showed how effective was the workshop and how the improved version of AI has enhanced the teaching process.",

Although experts now routinely compute graph algorithms on huge, unstructured graphs using high performance computing (HPC) or cloud resources, this practice hasn’t yet broken into the mainstream. Such computations require great expertise, yet users often need rapid prototyping and development to quickly customize existing code. Toward that end, we are exploring the use of the Chapel programming language as a means of making some important graph analytics more accessible, examining the breadth of characteristics that would make for a productive programming environment, one that is expressive, performant, portable, and robust.",

By presenting a simple yet reliable system, gas leakage detection system using MQ5 gas sensor and arduino uno controller is incorporated with a cloud storage for data collection and also used for storing and analyzing data. Gas leaked is converted from Parts Per Million (PPM) to volts through the arduino IDE and results in notifying the user when the threshold limit is crossed. The user is alerted via an application for quick notification through the internet and also through a buzzer /LED for physical notification.",

        "Abstract": "A water quality monitoring system can aid in preserving the environment, ensuring the security of nearby water sources, and fostering economic growth in rural areas. This results in the development of a system, employing the Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning to monitor the quality of water. This paper discusses the characteristics of water that explains whether it is fit for human consumption or not. The pH and Turbidity sensors are dipped in water samples acquired from wells, lakes, rivers, ponds, and other places are used to inform the development of an effective model. The data will be delivered from the sensors to the IDE, where it will then be sent to the cloud server. The model effectively accounts for test tables, where 1 indicates the water is fit for drinking and 0 indicates the water is unfit. The model is validated by employing Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and XG Boost methods. The maximum accuracy of 95.12% was observed using XGBoost. We have successfully implemented the real-time data for the water quality monitoring system for rural areas using Machine Learning and IoT which lets us know whether the water is fit for drinking or not.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, healthcare monitoring systems with advanced technologies have become a source of great anxiety for different countries worldwide. The healthcare system provides a report card of our health at regular intervals of time. The proposed smart health care monitoring system monitors the patient’s health condition and updates the same to the neighbours and doctors by using IoT technology. It addresses blood pressure, oxygen concentration in our blood, heart rate, and atmospheric pressure. The proposed system contains several sensors which are responsible for complete patient health monitoring. The system generates and stores useful continuous health data. After storing the health data in the cloud, the data has to be pre-processed and then generated into one report which includes the status of the health condition of the corresponding patient. The system reduces the cost of the treatment because patient needn’t to come daily to take readings of body temperature, SpO 2 etc. The system is basically wireless so we can embed at any location and the doctors and healthcare monitors can collects a data from any remote location. The major advantage of the system is more than one doctors collect the data from the cloudIoT at the same time. The system contains wireless sensors and application for displaying report of the person at each interval of time. It is very useful for the person who is living away from hospital or any remote location. It reduces time for the doctor so that they can attend more patients. In this paper, we used appropriate sensors which collect the appropriate data, so it is very useful for the doctor who analyses the data and predict the diseases. The proposed system used MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry transport) as a connectivity protocol as well as I2C (Inter Integrated Circuit). Here we used C, C++, and Arduino IDE as well open source IOT platform i.e., Ubidots. In this paper, we used experimental modal analysis system where the natural frequencies like heart rate, body temperature, ECG etc. are adopted as the observations.",

Several relevant issues have been tested such as device management patterns and some security concerns. The getting started issues of this technology have been emphasized. These include development machine compatibility, edge device choosing decisions, containers engine, and proper IDE for development. An emulated smart home scenario with five virtual sensor devices hosted by a Raspberry Pi edge device has been used as a case study to investigate the properties of the system. We have studied the results coming from applying the newly developed configuration management patterns to set or modify some environment variables remotely and inside the edge node. Furthermore, various operational cases have been studied to experimentally verify the difference when enabling edge analytics and when sending raw readings to the cloud. Indeed, the case of using symmetric encryption to increase the security aspects of the application has been studied and experimentally verified.",

        "Abstract": "The information available in crash reports has been used to understand the root cause of bugs and improve the overall quality of systems. Nonetheless, crash reports often lead to a huge amount of information, being necessary to consolidate the crash report data into groups, according to a set of well-defined criteria. Recent research work have proposed different criteria and techniques to group crash report data, making more effective the process of finding the root causes of a bug and showing the performance of the approaches in the context of open source applications (such as IDEs and web browsers). In spite of that, it is still not clear how these approaches perform in other application domains, such as enterprise systems. In this paper, we present an industrial study in this field. We tailor existing approaches to find and group correlated crash reports, and identify buggy files in the domain of web-based systems. We then evaluate the performance of the resulting criteria and technique in industrial settings - identifying and ranking the classes that are more likely to contribute to a crash and thus might need a fix. We also check if the methods changed by the developers to fix a bug are present in the stack traces of the crash report groups used to identify the buggy classes. Our study provides new pieces of evidence of the potential use of crash report groups to indicate buggy classes and methods using stack traces information. For instance, we successfully identify buggy classes with recall varying from 61.4% to 77.3%, considering the top 1, top 3, top 5, and top 10 suspicious buggy files identified and ranked by our approach. We also found that 80% of changed methods from the closed bug fix issues appeared in related stack traces of the crash report groups. Finally, the approach also received positive response from the project leaders of the evaluated projects to help their bug resolution processes.",

        "Abstract": "Power consumption in clusters has become increasingly important over the past few years. Our previous research had added power consumption to the list of managed resources to help to understand and control power profile of the clusters. We believe that in the near future, power consumption will be a charging criterion in the cloud computing services. User may pay for the energy used by their workload. Significant opportunities for power optimization exist at application design stage and are not yet fully exploited by application designers. However, it is difficult for developers to measure the energy used by their workload, and to explore how energy use might change with conditions that vary outside of the developer's control to build energy optimization policies. We solve the problem by proposing a function-component-level power model that allows developers to estimate the energy use for their application in function-level. Different from prior hardware-based measurement, we built the power prediction model based on profiling the Performance Monitor Counter, which is easy to deploy in various platforms. We also visualized the power data with call graph of the application and expand eclipse IDE tools with power feature. Experiment results showed that our method is lightweight and easy to use.",

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) allows a VM to be deployed, launched, and managed over a cluster of servers. Efficient VM assignment is often regarded as one of the most challenging issues for CPs to conquer because to the inherent tension between the goals of improving customer demand fulfilment while cutting costs and maximising asset efficiency. The purpose of this work is to provide a novel approach to allocating virtual machines to meet the needs of individual customers by using the modified emperor penguin optimization method algorithm. Relying on established optimization methods for efficient VM allocation further demonstrates the value of the suggested approach. This application was built using the Java programming language and deployed to the Netbeans IDE 12.4.",

        "Abstract": "This study uses common gas sensor to monitor for space hazard gases. At the same time, it combines the image information and publics the information in network open platform. In the open platform, users can see obviously and obtain data related to diverse environments in the meantime, including air quality index, temperature, humidity, PM2.5 index and so on. In addition, we combine with the DVR system in the open platform. The display aspect of the platform not only gets implemented through the webpage to demonstrate the characteristics of cross-platform, but also develop mobile APP to push notifications on the phone. In this way the project can be improved. In addition to passively providing relevant data, it can also proactively send the alert messages. In terms of hardware devices, we use the environmental data measurement module to carry wireless Wi-Fi modules. We use SHARP GP2Y1014AU PM2.5 air quality sensor with DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor. After integrating with the Node MCU to read the sensed value, it sends the packet through Wi-Fi, and transfer the device's numerical information to the database through ESP8266. Finally, the information gets disclosed to network open platform, and pushed notifications to users that have registered account and installed APP. In terms of software, we write the programs that read the sensor values and send the packets through the Arduino IDE, and these packets will be transferred to the Microsoft SQL Server database. Lastly, we build a network platform through the ASP.Net of Microsoft Visual Studio. Meantime, we use Android Studio to write the mobile APP. The information will be announced and pushed in multiple ways. The network architecture uses the local area network (LAN) to transmit data. The monitored messages are transmitted to the cloud, and then announce the messages through the background program. In the design of the field, we use the tree topology. The tree topology is a hierarchical centralized control network. Compare to the topology, the communication line of tree topology is short and low cost, and the search path is convenient and easy to expand.",

        "Abstract": "Issues related to water quality in urban areas are caused by human activities like industrialization, urbanization, and population growth, which lead to pollution of water sources. As a result, monitoring water quality in urban areas is crucial, and this has been accomplished via a system that employs Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) approaches. This paper analyses water properties and predicts if the water is safe to consume. The TDS & turbidity sensors are dipped in different water samples collected from tanks, submersibles, water towers, underground water, & other places, which helps to receive data in real-time. The information is first updated in the Arduino IDE before being uploaded to a cloud server. This real-time data is tested & validated on the model designed using different ML models like Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boost. The maximum accuracy achieved using XGBoost is 96.12%. After testing, we will be able to establish whether the water is safe to drink by utilising binary indicators of 1 and 0, where 1 indicates that the water is safe to drink and 0 indicates that it is not.",

        "Abstract": "A smart patient monitoring system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) was proposed in this paper that supports the health care unit, especially in light of the Covid-19 crisis. Health institutions suffer from many problems, such as the spread of infections among the health staff due to their direct communication with the patient, and the tremendous pressure on health institutions. These circumstances prompted to suggest a system that is capable of solving these problems and providing access to vital information such as body temperature, heartbeat and blood oxygen, as well as monitoring the recovery room such as temperature, humidity and gases by using wireless medical sensors. This data is transmitted to the computing cloud using wi-fi network, after which it is displayed on the Thing speak platform where doctors and nurses can monitor their patients remotely anywhere and anytime. The proposed system will use the machine learning algorithm and the hardware component (DHT11, MQ2, MAX30100 and MLX90614) sensors and the ESP NODE MCU microcontroller, which is programmed via the IDE software based on C language. The system achieved good results and a high accuracy with low energy consumption, according to the experiments' results.",

        "Abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) is a subject of great interest and is the current technology. For the last few years, IoT application has increased many folds. In addition, systems security has been a wonderful field for research activities. The mutual authentication between the IoT devices and Users of the IoT Environment is a significant part of secure IoT systems. At present the widely used authentication mechanisms are Single password based and are likely vulnerable to side-channel and dictionary attacks. This paper introduces a multi-key-based mutual authentication mechanism to provide a contract for secure authentication and communication between the IoT devices and Users of the IoT Environment. It also deals with publish-subscribe-based Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol is used for secure communication, which is bandwidth-efficient and uses a small amount of battery power. The blockchain technology is used in the present work to store data helps to bring trust and transparency to the developed model. The implementation of this entire methodology, the authors has created a prototype using Node MCU ESP8266 and Arduino IDE IoT platform for IoT Environment. To have secured communication via the cloud has been designed for the client to control IoT devices, and the same will be stored using blockchain technology for future data validation. The Node MCU ESP8266 IoT platform used in the present work makes effective and fast IoT applications.",

        "Abstract": "Trying clothes in clothing stores is usually a time-consuming activity. Besides, it might not even be possible to try-on clothes in such cases as online shopping. Our motivation here is to increase the time efficiency and improve the accessibility of clothes try on by creating a virtual dressing room environment. In this work, we introduce a virtual dressing room application using Microsoft Kinect sensor. Our proposed approach is mainly based on extraction of the user from the video stream, alignment of models and skin color detection. We use the modules for locations of the joints for positioning, scaling and rotation in order to align the 2D cloth models with the user. Then, we apply skin color detection on video to handle the unwanted occlusions of the user and the model. Finally, the model is superimposed on the user in real time. The problem is simply the alignment of the user and the cloth models with accurate position, scale, rotation and ordering. First, detection of the user and the body parts is one of the main steps of the problem. In literature, several approaches are proposed for body part detection, skeletal tracking and posture estimation, and superimposing it onto a virtual environment in the user interface. The project is implemented in C# programming environment for real time, Kinect hacking application. Kinect driver's middleware are used for various fundamental functions and for the tracking process in combination with Microsoft Kinect.",

        "Abstract": "Solving individual tasks plays an important role while studying programming but teachers do not see how learners achieve the result, especially in the case of massive open online courses (MOOCs). Investigating the process of solving programming tasks can provide the teacher with valuable information. The aim of this study is to find answers to the following questions based on the log files of the programming environment Thonny: What behaviour patterns of different learners in solving programming tasks can be identified based on the example of a summary task of the MOOC “Introduction to Programming”? What types of learners can be distinguished on the basis of the behaviour patterns of task solving? The analysis of learners’ behaviour patterns was performed by observing whether they solved the task gradually or not, i.e., whether they wrote the program in parts while also testing their work in the meantime, or whether they tested it for the first time only after they had written the bulk of the solution. In the context of the solution of the MOOC summary task, one can observe that the seven learners who spent the most time and had the greatest number of error messages and repetitive error messages did not work in a gradual style. It is possible that recommending a gradual solution process can help beginners to better understand their code and find errors. It can reduce situations with many concurrent errors in the code making it difficult to understand why any specific error message was generated.",

They then propose an implementation of this convention as an extension to an existing structure-editor programming environment, which allows high-level design to take-place online. As the user graphically edits this design, the system silently tracks the set of low-level details that are necessary to ultimately conform the program code with the design. The necessary changes are then presented sequentially to the user after the design phase is complete. It is further suggested that this convention is useful as a way to view already completed programs, and as a tool for debugging.<>",

        "Abstract": "In the modern technological era there is a need of virtual instrumentation in testing and experimentation of electrical machines and drives in colleges, universities and other academic institution to increase accuracy, efficiency and analytical part in the experiment. This paper proposes a virtual instrumentation technique for online testing and performance analysis of 3 phase induction motor which replaces conventional method of doing experiments and use of old measuring equipment like ammeter, voltmeter, tachometer, power analyzer. A new method called impedance method is also presented in this paper to measure speed without using speed sensor and tachometer which reduces the no. of sensor used in the analysis. With the help of a data acquisition board, a small sensor circuit and a computer, this technology makes the whole analysis faster, more comprehendible, lucid, and user friendly. All the estimation algorithms are implemented in LabView G programming environment. In addition, the virtual instrumented technique presented here is also validated by a verification method which is done using traditional instrumentation model.",

In addition, the mechanism of data transmission is designed also in the main controller. Aiming at the shortcoming of Dynamixel RX-28 that cannot be online controlled, a control software is developed under the programming environment VC++, so that the cockroach robot can be actuated by Dynamixel RX-28 in joint space and task space. Finally, an experiment is designed to control the 2-DOF, and 3-DOF single-leg of a cockroach robot respectively. The result verifies that the cockroach robot based on the Dynamixel RX-28 is small in size, light in weight and high in control accuracy.",

The approach, that was introduced in a previous paper [3], presents programming concepts using icons and “flowcharts”, and a 3D robotics simulator (CoppeliaSim), that has free educational use. This time, a real version of the simulated robot, built using Arduino and cheap, easily obtainable electronic components, is also presented. The programs to control the robot are developed by graphically constructing flowcharts on the visual editor, and then following the execution of programs using the simulated (or real) robot, step by step. This graphic program editor is named “FluxProg”, and its 2nd version is now available online, with new features comprising variables, arithmetic and logic expressions, thus providing a complete programming environment.",

        "Abstract": "A project undertaken to measure the alignment of the TFTR (Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor) bumper limiter in relation to the toroidal magnetic field axis is discussed. The process involved the measurement of the toroidal magnetic field and the positions of the tiles that make up the bumper limiter. The basis for the instrument control and data acquisition system was LabVIEW. LabVIEW is a graphical programming system for developing scientific and engineering applications on a Macintosh. With LabVIEW, users create graphical software modules called virtual instruments instead of writing conventional text-based code. To measure the magnetic field, the control system acquired data from two nuclear magnetic resonance magnetometers while the toroidal field coils were pulsed. To measure the position of the tiles on the limiter, an instrumented mechanical arm was used inside the vessel. LabVIEW's graphical programming environment provided an easy transition from engineering-design block diagram to a VI block diagram, which made for speedy development. It also provided for quick and painless online systems integration, which proved to be essential to the timely completion of the project.<>",

The ultimate purpose of the CPSS is to provide a parallel programming environment which allows users to study impacts of system and software factors on program performance and to locate performance bottlenecks in parallel programs. Our simulator can accurately simulate a large range of regular topologies that represent the communication structures of most wormhole routed networks. Users are given the flexibility of changing communication and computation parameters as often as needed without recompilation. It is unique in its integrated parallel simulation of the communication process and the execution of user applications. This makes possible real time evaluation of network performance in realistic application domains.",

Availability of a fuzzy library equipped with some of the commonly used fuzzy operations, a menu driven user interface, an online help manual, and provision to redirect the system to a C/Prolog environment to permit program development in C or Prolog are some of the features of this tool. The author discusses the implementation of a fuzzy clustering algorithm using FUZZY ENVIRON. The algorithm, developed by R.T. Yeh and S.Y. Bang (1975), deals with the problem of grouping of individuals into clusters when the measure of possession of characteristics by the individuals is fuzzy. The implementation of the algorithm using FUZZY ENVIRON has not only resulted in the program development being less tedious, but also in the program being less complex.<>",

        "Abstract": "Mobile computing has found a number of newer applications today ranging from PDAs and cellphones to a number of applications in the field of education. One such application is the “mobile examination system”. Mobile examination system is a technique of conducting the examination without the use of pen and paper. The technique involves the use of a mobile device in the hands of the student through which he/she can take the examination. Result is displayed immediately after the examination ends. The system is consistent with the current technological advancements in the mobile device design & the wireless technology. The motivation behind the design of the system is to find an alternative to the traditional method of conduct of the examination wherein a lot of head ache is involved for both the students as well as examiners (faculty members). The system is basically an extension of the online examination system. The system has been designed in the Qt SDK, a freeware IDE provided by Forum Nokia. The backend database used by us is the open source SQLite. In this paper I have brought out the detailed technical design of my mobile examination system along with the work flow between various modules of the system.",

        "Abstract": "Software developers often do not possess the knowledge needed to understand a piece of code at hand, and the lack of code comments and outdated documentation exacerbates the problem. Asking for the help of colleagues, browsing the official documentation, or accessing online resources, such as Stack Overflow, can clearly help in this \"code comprehension\" activity that, however, still remains highly time-consuming and is not always successful. Enhancing this process has been addressed in different studies under the subject of automatic documentation of software artifacts. For example, \"recommender systems\" have been designed with the goal of retrieving and suggesting relevant pieces of information (e.g., Stack Overflow discussions) for a given piece of code inspected in an IDE. However, these techniques rely on limited contextual information, mainly solely source code. Our goal is to build a context-aware proactive recommender system supporting the code comprehension process. The system must be able to understand the context, consider the developer's profile, and help her by generating pieces of documentation at whatever granularity is required, e.g., going from summarizing the responsibilities implemented in a subsystem, to explaining how two classes collaborate to implement a functionality, down to documenting a single line of code. Generated documentation will be tailored for the current context (e.g., the task at hand, the developer's background knowledge, the history of interactions). In this paper we present our first steps toward our goal by introducing the ADANA project, a framework which generates fine-grained code comments for a given piece of code.",

        "Abstract": "Computer vision has recently been dominated by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), these are a kind of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) mostly employed for image classification and object detection. Identifying a snake species is important when interacting with the species as well as when treating injuries due to envenoming. This task however proves to be a hurdle for the general public. This paper, therefore, sought to solve the problem of misidentification of snake species which often leads to envenoming, and mishandling of snake species by harnessing the power of CNNs together with the portability of mobile devices in developing a mobile application that identifies snake species from images almost in real-time. In implementing this system, the CNN model was trained in Google Collab on a custom-tailored dataset. The images in the dataset were sourced from the internet, and were divided into eight classes which represented eight different snake species. The images were annotated using MakeSense.ai, an online data annotation tool. After annotation the images were piped into the YOLOv5 CNN model on Google Collab for model training. The training process yielded an accuracy of 71% for all the eight classes. After training, the model was converted to a Tensorflow Lite model and exported to Android Studio IDE wherein the rest of the application was developed using Java programming language.",

The world is confronting a problem of untimely death owing to a variety of ailments, which is caused by a lack of timely medical care for patients. The major objective was to develop a reliable IoT-based patient monitoring system so that medical personnel could keep an eye on their patients, whether they are in a hospital or at home, in order to give better patient care. The development of a smart phone broadband healthcare application allows for the provision of online real-time data regarding a patient's physiological state. The system consists primarily of sensors, a data acquisition unit, such as an Arduino, and software (Arduino IDE). The technology monitors and stores the patient's temperature and heart rate, which is then relayed to the doctor's mobile phone, which has the app. As a result, a realtime patient monitoring system powered by the Internet of Things may successfully track a patient's condition and save lives.",

        "Abstract": "The control system design of an industrial welding robot is presented. Its purpose is to automate the sealing process of a metallic cask which welds the lid of the cask on to the body. The actuation and control of the welding machine deals with the components, circuitry, and coding behind it. The components are decided based on the functional requirements, also making it safe in case of failure using Limit Switches. Two Arduino MEGA 2560 boards have been used; one to control the motion, and one to measure electrical parameters. Coding is done on Arduino IDE and the program has been tested by simulating it in WOKWI, an online Arduino simulator. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) was made using the Windows Form App (.NET Framework) of Visual Studios using C# language. The algorithm and the program have been validated using a physical mock-up.",

        "Abstract": "Globalization of integrated circuits (ICs) may lead to the quality of ICs being compromised due to the possible untrusted entities involved in the supply chain. There have been well documented cases of chips secretly implanted with Trojans creeping into the supply chain. Studies have shown that tampering lithographic masks, also called as reticles, is one of the potential sources of hardware Trojan intrusion. This paper presents a novel blockchain-enabled mask writing technique to combat the alteration of the IC layout design at the mask making step. A blockchain-enabled file storage and transfer system for secure transfer of the layout GDSII file from the design house to the mask making machine is studied in this work. As part of this investigation, a smart contract is developed, which interacts with an external application programming interface (API) and fetches the design layout file from the file storage system. The smart contract developed as part of the research can be adopted in the existing EDA tools for mask making, curtailing the access sought by an adversary in the mask making process. The proposed smart contract is developed using Solidity language, on an online IDE called Remix. Finally, a case study is presented in this paper, validating the approach and simulating the proposed smart contract. The simulation of the smart contract is conducted on Goerli test network provided by Ethereum.",

The Web based framework, called DOME, allows designers to build integrated models using both local and distributed resources, and to collaborate by exchanging services in a network centric environment. An integrated model can be created while each participant focuses on their own area of expertise. A design problem model is created by connecting modules, each of which can represent specific components, analysis capabilities/software, disciplines, or organizations relevant to the problem. The resulting module network forms a concurrent model in which changes propagate through service exchanges. A Java applet based user interface provides cross-platform and distributed user access to DOME module servers throughout the network.",

Due to the fact that the Internet becomes more integrated into our daily lives, several possibilities have arisen to use this cost-effective worldwide standard for distributing data. National Instruments LabVIEW is available to publish data from the development environment to the Web. The student can access the remote laboratory and perform experiments without any limitation of time and location. They can also observe the signals by changing the parameters of the experiment and evaluating the results. During the session, the teacher can watch and communicate with students who perform their experiment. The usefulness of remote laboratory in teaching environments is already known: it saves equipment, personnel for the institution and it saves time and money for the remote students. It also allows the same equipment to be used in research purposes by many teams, through Internet. The experiments proved the feasibility of technical solutions, as well as the correctness of implementation in this paper.",

        "Abstract": "Middleware covers a variety of rapidly evolving capabilities. It began as software to fill the gaps as industry moved first to client-server and then to multi-tier distributed systems. As monolithic software was broken up and dispersed across servers, it became necessary to reconnect capabilities, manage disparate resources and functions, and access information and functions from remote requesters. This resulted in a host of software offerings for the middle tier. Component Broker is Internet middleware for distributed objects. It is designed to absorb complexity in the operational and development environment so that applications appear to be transparent, local and fully resourced. Component Broker is a complete package, with everything a developer needs to build, run and manage Web-enabled business objects, components and applications.",

To cope with these difficulties, they browse the Internet for code samples, tutorials, and API documentation. In general, it is time-consuming to find relevant help from the plethora of information on the web. While programmers can use search-based tools to help locate code snippets or applications that may be relevant to the APIs they are using, they still face the significant challenge of understanding and assessing the quality of the search results. We propose to investigate a proactive help system that is integrated in a development environment to provide contextual suggestions to the programmers as the code is being read and edited in the editor.",

        "Abstract": "The world has gone mobile. As a result, it changes the people's mindset and preferences. People tend to choose smaller and compact devices due to its mobility and started to leave the desktops and laptops behind. For that reason, many companies have engaged in taking a further step to update their services to be accessible from these kinds of device as well. However, to absolutely dispose and replace the legacy system in short time seems inappropriate, therefore having cross-platforms applications will be the best solution. With the aim to bring more convenience to the tendering services offered by a construction industry, this paper proposes a cross-platform application development environment adapted Spring framework to secure a connection between two platforms; Android and Windows. The application is able to manage requests from the front-end; the android platform devices to the Web that runs on desktop. The system architecture, the framework implementation and the application design are then presented.",

This paper demonstrates one of these efforts by introducing a newly developed educational environment that could help high school students learn computer programming language. Code Genie was designed to integrate art, animation, and code sharing in teaching programming. Using this web-based learning environment, students can learn how to write a program in a JavaScript language, and how to produce artwork from coding, then share it with others. JavaScript was chosen for its popularity, simplicity and because it is a real programming language that is currently used by software developers who create real software products. The Code Genie learning environment and the motivation behind developing it for high school students are discussed in this paper. It was tested during three coding workshops. Student responses to the tool's usefulness and ease of use will be explained.",

It enables collection, analysis, distribution and acting based on the business information and for the purpose of easier solving of management problems and making of best business decisions. So, business intelligence system originally intended for the decision makers even though in todaypsilas modern conditions of new economies decisions are made by majority of the managers in the company. SQL server 2008 and Visual Studio 2005 together offer deeper integration between the data base in the application development then ever before. Programmers now have the possibility to create a CLR stored procedure, function and user defined types directly from Visual Studio development environment. Other then that, Visual Studio 2005 supports all new SQL Server data types. Business Intelligence with Office Share Point Server 2007 system facilitate to people who make decisions to access information and analyze them at any time, anywhere. Managers in the trading company can use updated information wherever people are working, cooperate and make decisions regardless whether this is on desktop or via Web.",

        "Abstract": "Geographic information systems (GIS) are now widely used. WebGIS, pushed by keeping increasing information resources, enriches functions and content of GIS under WWW framework. We propose a mobile agent-based middleware for WebGIS, called M4WebGIS, which consists of a group of coordinated agents for users to retrieve geographic information. Function logic of server part, processing logic of client part and underlying operation of system, such as interaction with operating system, network, and database, are designed separately in M4WebGIS to achieve stability. Independence between modules ensures extensibility. Moreover, functions such as map management, user management and data management, make M4WebGIS as an integrated middleware system. M4WebGIS offers functions, such as roaming and zooming in several map layers, spatial information analysis and retrieval, database supporting, real-time event tracking, different systems compatibility supporting, and adding spatial characteristics to Web site. Using M4WebGIS, application developers, data distributors and spatial database engine vendors can add dynamic, data-driven map to their applications. M4WebGIS can be integrated into development environment seamlessly, reducing application system complexity, speeding up development progress of applications, alleviating cost and enhancing maintainability as well. In the distributed environment, M4WebGIS achieves pretty parallel computing, balances network workload, acquires exact geographic information and saves network bandwidth.",

A declared project goal was to evaluate service programmability, speed and flexibility in the creation of complex services based on simple building blocks. We implemented an OSA/Parlay gateway with a Parlay call control interface to control a SIP (session initiation protocol) proxy. A Parlay framework performs registration, trust and security, discovery, service agreement management, service profiling and subscription tasks. The software is implemented in Java using CORBA component model (CCM). User profiling and service chaining possibilities are extensively used in a complex scenario including external voice server, Web based groupware and call setup functionality provided via Parlay APIs (application programming interface).",

        "Abstract": "Embedded technology and people's lives have been closely related, but traditional data acquisition system only responds to particular signals, which is quite limited. A newly-designed idea is proposed in this paper with ARM9 processor as the core components to design a common data acquisition system. We need to use different data acquisition board according to different signals, to form a user-defined data acquisition system conveniently, flexibly and fast. Hardware structure is made up of Web Server, ARM9 system board and the multi-block STM8L data acquisition board. With Linux as the operating system, ARM9 system board, based on the Qt platform, develops the application program and completes the corresponding tests. It mainly includes: (1) In accordance with the actual application requirements, this paper proposes that the system should focus on the characteristics of high-precision, high speed, low-power and strong anti-jamming to design, and gives the overall system design and structural design of intelligent nodes. (2) The concrete hardware circuit design of common data acquisition system has been accomplished, which mainly includes designing STM8L data acquisition board and ARM9 system board. (3) The concrete software design of common data acquisition system has been accomplished, which mainly includes building Linux operating system, building Qt development environment, ADC, digital filtering, designing real-time data communications, real-time graphics display applications and so on. (4) Because it is battery-powered in STM8L data acquisition board, the system needs to work with low power. Based on the analysis of energy consumption in STM8L data acquisition board, the system has adaptive mechanisms of sleep to reduce system power consumption, ensuring the system can orderly run for a long time.",

Our algorithm is compositional, and checks each process interacting with an abstraction of its peers, without constructing the product state space. Interactions between pairs of peer processes are modeled using conversation automata which encode the set of valid message exchange sequences between the two processes. A process is consistent if each possible conversation leaves its peer automata in a state labeled as consistent and the overall execution satisfies a user-specified predicate on the automata states. We have implemented BPELCheck in the Enterprise Service Pack of the NetBeans development environment. Our tool handles the major syntactic constructs of BPEL, including sequential and parallel composition, exception handling, flows, and Boolean state variables. We have used BPELCheck to check conversational consistency for a set of BPEL processes, including an industrial example.",

        "Abstract": "The pump is one of the key equipments for the safety production of coal mine. It bears the important task to discharge all the underground water. However, the performance efficiency of the water pump will be declined, in the long run. Therefore, in order to ensure the safety production, users should check and test the pump performance regularly ,to test if every target pump has live up to the ldquoCoal Mine Safety Regulationsrdquo. The ultimate goal in finding the fault in time, eliminating hidden dangers, reducing accidents,and saving maintenance costs can be attained. Virtual instrument is the production of modern computer and instrument technology combined in-depth, and is an important technology of computer-assisted testing area. The core idea is \"software replacing hardware\". The paper introduces the virtual instrument technology into the field of pump performance testing, and designs the mine pump comprehensive performance testing system based on Labview. The system takes software development environment-LabVIEW as platform and based on personal computer, and realizes the function that pumppsilas import and export of water pressure, flow, speed, power, and other signals measured in real-time and dynamic displayed. It uses the polynomial fitting module of LabVIEW to fit the performance curve,and shows the performance curve by the waveform display. At the same time,it uses the Web Publishing Tool of LabVIEW to release the testing interface to the internet,and realizes its network communication function. Compared with traditional instruments,the pump performance testing system which based on Virtual instrument run stably, have strongly data analytical and processing functions, beautiful interface, easy operation, strongly visual function, highly testing precision.",

Nevertheless, there is still a significant lack of data that has practical application value. To solve these problems, we propose SODAS (Smart Open Data As a Service) as a novel open data platform for efficient data sharing and utilization. We first analyze the major problems in the legacy CKAN and then draw up their solutions through core strategies. We next define four components and nine function blocks of SODAS for each core strategy. As a result, SODAS drives Open Data Portal, Open Data Reference Model, DataMap Publisher, and ADE Provisioning (Analytics and Development Environment Provisioning) by connecting the defined function blocks. We confirm that each function works correctly through the SODAS Web portal and apply SODAS to actual data distribution sites to prove its efficiency and practical use. SODAS is the first open data platform that provides secure interoperability between heterogeneous platforms based on international standards and enables domain-free data management with flexible metadata.",

        "Abstract": "Computation coordination is an important decision making activity in the real-time distributed computing in order to achieve the optimal performance. The computing power sharing (CPS) is a lightweight web services based architecture, and suitable for enterprise computing works which are able to run in batch format within a trusty network. The architecture relies on business process execution language (BPEL) which provides a visualized development environment and workflow control management. An adaptive real-time coordination module based on fuzzy group decision making policy that implements fuzzy resolution process facilitates the CPS architecture to provide the real-time computation coordination with quality of service. In this paper, the collaborated computing system has been applied to analyze the robustness of digital watermark by filter bank selection. As the result of this study, the performance can be improved in the aspect of speedup, stability and process time.",

We add new features and capabilities to the editor, including calculation of a cyclomatic complexity and generation of SVG files for a given Hichart diagram. In this paper, we present a method of automatically generating a SVG file for a given program diagram based on attribute graph grammars. The thus obtained SVG file can animate a process of calculating a cyclomatic complexity of a given Hichart diagram on any readily available Web browsers. We also describe an automatic generation of a SVG file which can be displayed when diagrams are aesthetically drawn.",

Following such idea, this paper presents preliminary study results of a prototype architecture created with the purpose of using a domain-driven approach to shorten the development of software projects. Our discussion presents a way of sharing business domain models, developed in different project sites, to work together and establish a cooperative development environment. Using a set of development and architectural standards, and modelling theories such as MDA, SOA and Web Services, the proposed architecture indicates that, with the aid of standard and controlled techniques, it is possible to obtain significant gains on software scheduling and cost.",

The ABET Outcomes addressed include c, d, e, f, g, and h, however others could be incorporated depending on the project. In addition, this experience serves to reinforce design concepts learned in previous courses and requires the students to develop real-world prototypes for implementation. The specific projects focus on designing and developing assistive technologies for disabled individuals employed at not-for-profit agencies. The devices provide the individuals with increased accessibility to employment opportunities. The students employ a variety of design tools including Manhattan, a web-based forum for sharing designs and communication. Recent projects in the area of manual work have included box folding, screw packaging, tape cutting, and folder assembly. The projects are successful in several ways. The students gain valuable interdisciplinary design experience, the not-for-profit agency gains needed assistance in their production, and the individuals with disabilities become more productive employees. This design experience provides a framework for emulating a modern product development environment with participating team members located at different universities around the world.",

        "Abstract": "End-user applications aimed at the public in general (mobile and web applications, games, etc.) are usually developed with feedback from only a tiny fraction of the millions of intended users, and are thus built under significant uncertainty. The developer cannot really tell a priori which features the users will like, which they will dislike, and which ones will help create the desired outcome, such as high usage or increased revenue. In these cases, providing adaptive capabilities can be the key factor in the application's success. Existing self-adaptive techniques can provide some of the needed capabilities, but they too must be planned, and leave the developers, and much of the development process, \"out of the loop\". We propose a development environment that allows the wisdom of the crowd to influence the very structure and flow of the program being created, by voting upon behavioral choices as they are observed in early versions of the working program. The approach still allows the developers to retain known desired behaviors, and to enforce constraints on crowd-driven changes. The developers can also react to ongoing crowd-programmed feedback throughout the entire lifetime of the application.",

        "Abstract": "It is a common problem in industry that the development of software does not go hand-in-hand with the development of the hardware that the software is intended to control. A similar situation can occur in the undergraduate laboratory. Here a student, having designed the software component of a project, can't gain access to the necessary hardware to prepare for or complete a laboratory because of schedule/security difficulties. Over the past year we have overcome this problem by using \"virtual\" hardware, where device operation is simulated in software. We have generalized the approach so that the virtual devices can be used in conjunction with microprocessor simulator software and with actual evaluation boards for both RISC and CISC systems. We are in the preliminary development stages of a new HTML Web page approach where we control, rather than just launch, these commercial simulation packages. Such an approach would provide a controlled, interactive, tutorial environment for students taking microprocessor courses. There are further industrial and academic advantages of such an approach which can help to overcome the initial learning curve for the tools. We discuss the basics of developing \"virtual\" devices for use with the Windows based development environment provided with Software Development Systems 68 K and PowerPC free sample kits. These devices can then be ported to the Motorola M68332EVK and Advanced Micro Devices' SA29200 microprocessor evaluation boards to provide actual hardware experience.",

        "Abstract": "Smart devices have many sensors that capture the user data and use it for device control, improving the user experience, or send it through a computer network in order to be processed. The interaction between user and applications, especially in virtual reality, is made via motion and gestures with information offered by sensors such as accelerometer, compass or gyroscope. In order to reduce the complexity of developing this type of applications, it is possible to write hybrid applications that allow the programmer to code using web technologies then deploy and run the resulted applications natively on multiple operating systems. This paper presents the implementation of a virtual reality drawing hybrid application, created with the Telerik Mobile platform, which reads the compass and accelerometer data and sends the information to a server that creates a 3D representation using the Processing Development Environment.",

        "Abstract": "Software defined radio (SDR) has the potential to reduce drastically the types of radios in the inventory since a single hardware package can be programmed to replicate the coding, modulation and other signaling features now used in legacy networks, plus adapt to next generation developments. Future Department of Defense (DoD) radios can benefit from this software programmability and thus simplify interoperability, maintenance and life cycle cost concerns. Methods for the rapid development and distribution of waveform software must be created in order to realize the full potential of a communications system that can change parameters such as waveform, operating frequency, protocols and error correction. There needs to be a standard SDR waveform development process addressing all of the engineering design steps for faster, simpler and more economical waveform development. This paper discusses, and provides clear answers to, the following questions. Why do we want (or need) a waveform development environment (WDE)? Can HW/SW decisions be pushed down to the lowest appropriate decomposition level? Should the language be standardized so that it has the widest potential applicability? Could the environment build upon the latest multimedia developments, so that they could be both more affordable and supportable? Should there be a definitive migration path towards future upgrades (e.g. Internet and Web-based technologies)?.",

There were a lot of previous researches studied about hardware solution, and only few papers that focused on green software area. However, there is lacking of research that discusses about how to implement knowledge management method to manage the green knowledge of software development. As we know that software development is an important role in supporting the IT community, hence the unmanaged green knowledge of software development will lead to the problem of unable to meet both the environmental and business demands to the community. Therefore, this research will focus on proposing a model that applies web-based knowledge management system to manage and share the green knowledge of software development among the members of community of practice in software development environment.",

        "Abstract": "In present complex Embedded World, a large number of devices are based on embedded ×86 systems. The presence of ×86 architecture not only increases the complexity of the system but also makes the system a bit vulnerable. To overcome this weakness of embedded systems an intermediate hardware based solution is considered to be the best approach. The initiation of this work has been adapted from the research work done by Sven Plaga and was published in [2]. This paper presents the implementation of such an intermediate hardware module whose target is to provide a flexible development environment for the embedded developers. Moreover, helpful environments for embedded module customers in order to track down the error with the help of remote debug. The proposed hardware is layered between the ×86 computer-on-module and the backplane, to have full access to all the interfaces of the ×86 module. It consists of a Cyclone III Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and an Arm 7 microcontroller performing higher end tasks such as power profiling and remote assistance - therefore it is named “Embedded Controller Interface” (ECI). The ECI is also capable of hosting a small web server; therefore, all the captured data can be accessed over Internet. The presented work also introduces a new concept to the Embedded World - the concept of a hardware based Shared Memory System between ×86 microprocessor and microcontroller.",

The application also offers a data compression service. Although the set of operational requirements will initially be small, the goal is to implement the application following a modern software development methodology, to design with a modern architecture and to rely on a modern stack of technologies, so that our application is easily maintainable and scalable in the future. The latest design patterns will be used in the construction of the application, such as microservices, the model-view-controller technique and three-tier architecture. In the above context, a prototype of the application will be developed, initially in a local development environment, but with the prospect that it will be transferred in the future to a hosting environment so that it is accessible to all.",

Businesses with USN and technologies for USN, however, are still far from mature. We address issues concerning technology development, environment creation, and service model for the businesses using USN. We propose a USN business platform composed of three parts that are in charge of communication, information management, and applications, respectively. The platform composed of sensor cells and a managed wireless mesh network will be able to create new USN domains logically separated from but cooperative with Web domains on the current Internet, providing novel, context-aware, interactive services to users with the use of information from sensors deployed across heterogeneous networks. We present our ideas on approaches for making USN businesses and services available, and we suggest that government should support large-scale, long-term experimental service operation with the use of a comprehensive prototype system that can provide test applications to the public.",

        "Abstract": "Nowadays, parallel program development is paving path for providing an efficient solution to scientific problems. Particularly, the use of graphic cards has gained popularity since a large number of cores are available at an affordable price. However, the development of graphic card programs could be a challenge since the software developers must know the card architecture for its implementation. This paper proposes the GLG (Graphic Language for GPUs) visual language for developing programs in CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture). GLG programs could be created easily through icons interconnections validated by a grammar. In addition, a web GLG development environment is proposed that uses a client-server architecture to perform the execution of visual programs.",

This effort is in response to the opportunity provided by Web services technologies to create an enterprise software development environment of loosely connected applications and services. When based on communication standards rather than specific implementation technologies, these applications and services are capable of a great degree of interoperability and reuse. The U.S. e-government initiative is aligned with this paradigm and calls for an information architecture that is service-oriented, highly interoperable, and standards-based. This document presents the organizational context and technical details of the N-tier, service-oriented architecture being developed to support this effort.",

        "Abstract": "To encourage effective monitoring in plant agriculture, we have studied an IoT application for plant agriculture monitoring systems. This application helps users monitor and track plant environmental conditions through the user’s device. It uses login and token-based authentication for security. However, it may introduce potential vulnerabilities that may arise from intercepting passwords due to the inherent insecurity of HTTP communication for data transmission in the development environment and token inexpiration. To address these security concerns, we propose secure authentication for accessing the plant monitoring system’s sensor data. The proposed solution incorporates two-factor authentication (2FA) and JSON web tokens (JWT) approaches to enhance security. The 2FA requires users to provide an additional verification step beyond username and password to access the application. Additionally, JWT enhances security of token-based authentication. By introducing an expiration time to the tokens, the vulnerability associated with token reuse is minimized. Then, we implement and verify the functionality of the proposed solution through system testing.",

In this paper, the author proposes a comprehensive and intelligent-based agent platform known as 'intelligent java agent development environment' for the development of smart (via the implementation of 'conscious layer'), compact and highly mobile agent applications. From the implementation point of view, the author introduces an intelligent fuzzy neural-based mobile shopping agent based on the integration of WAP and java servlets technology. Promising results in terms of agent mobility, fuzzy-neural shopping efficiency and effectiveness have been obtained.",

Half of the users spent time planning their project by creating a concept map before starting the programming; across planning conditions, half of the users were males and half female. Participants who did concept mapping or who were male were more attracted to database programming; however planning did not affect feelings of success and in general females felt more successful than males. We discuss the implications of these findings for work on gender and for future EUP tools and training.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper we present a software platform called Chatbot designed to introduce high school students to Computer Science (CS) concepts in an innovative way: by programming chatbots. A chatbot is a bot that can be programmed to have a conversation with a human or robotic partner in some natural language such as English or Spanish. While programming their chatbots, students use fundamental CS constructs such as variables, conditionals, and finite state automata, among others. Chatbot uses pattern matching, state of the art lemmatization techniques, and finite state automata in order to provide automatic formative assessment to the students. When an error is found, the formative feedback generated is immediate and task-level. We evaluated Chatbot in two observational studies. An online nation-wide competition where more than 10,000 students participated. And, a mandatory in-class 15-lesson pilot course in three high schools. We measured indicators of student engagement (task completion, participation, self reported interest, etc.) and found that girls engagement with Chatbot was higher than boys for most indicators. Also, in the online competition, the task completion rate for the students that decided to use Chatbot was five times higher than for the students that chose to use the renowned animation and game programming tool Alice. Our results suggest that the availability of automatic formative assessment may have an impact on task completion and other engagement indicators among high school students.",

        "Abstract": "This paper describes a new technological evolution of the Sucre project, which aims to foster a vocation for science and develop computational thinking and programming skills in pre-university students. This improved version is called Sucre4Stem and has been designed from the Internet of Things perspective. At a technological level, we differentiate two main tools, SucreCore andSucreCode. SucreCore provides a new, more compact design, encapsulates an advanced microcontroller and supports wireless connectivity with the ability to create online variables and functions. SucreCode, the block-based visual programming tool, has a revamped interface and allows wireless communication with SucreCore. At the pedagogical level, Sucre4Stem makes it easier to implement new group dynamics and to create novel types of collaborative projects between groups of students. In this article, we also explore how these collaborative projects can be carried out by taking advantage of the different types of communications between SucreCore and the server-side platform using shared online variables and functions.",

        "Abstract": "The integration of big data analytics and cognitive computing results in a new model that can provide the utilization of the most complicated advances in industry and its relevant decision-making processes as well as resolving failures faced during big data analytics. In E-projects portfolio selection (EPPS) problem, big data-driven decision-making has a great importance in web development environments. EPPS problem deals with choosing a set of the best investment projects on social media such that maximum return with minimum risk is achieved. To optimize the EPPS problem on social media, this study aims to develop a hybrid fuzzy multi-objective optimization algorithm, named as NSGA-III-MOIWO encompassing the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) and multi-objective invasive weed optimization (MOIWO) algorithms. The objectives are to simultaneously minimize variance, skewness and kurtosis as the risk measures and maximize the total expected return. To evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid algorithm, the data derived from 125 active E-projects in an Iranian web development company are analyzed and employed over the period 2014-2018. Finally, the obtained experimental results provide the optimal policy based on the main limitations of the system and it is demonstrated that the NSGA-III-MOIWO outperforms the NSGA-III and MOIWO in finding efficient investment boundaries in EPPS problems. Finally, an efficient statistical-comparative analysis is performed to test the performance of NSGA-III-MOIWO against some well-known multi-objective algorithms.",

        "Abstract": "With Web services predicted to become distributed computing architecture in near future, maintainability of the Web applications (WAs) will rank high on selection criteria while choosing a platform for development of a WA. The goal of this paper is to evaluate maintainability of small-scale WAs built on J2EE, .NET and Ruby On Rails (RoR). The maintainability criteria considered comprised of modifiability, testability, understandability and portability. We found that the RoR implementation fared better on modifiability, testability, and understandability, while J2EE implementation was the most portable. The results led us to comment on the maintainability of small WAs with respect to underlying architecture and development environments the three platforms provide. We believe that results are expected to vary for medium and large-size WAs. The work included here is part of an effort to build a decision framework for platform selection for WAs.",

The authors have worked with several such research groups to design, develop, and deploy such web applications that are increasingly based on Jupyter notebooks. One of the primary reasons among many to use Jupyter notebooks is the fact that research groups inheriting these applications are capable of maintaining and extending them. In this paper, we walk through the design process for one such application and discuss development environments that are best suited to Jupyter notebook development. We then explore several other applications where we employ similar design patterns. In doing so, we expound upon the benefits, limitations, and challenges of Notebook-based applications to provide a guide for other facilitators in similar situations.",

It is particularly suitable, and widely adopted, for cloud-based applications, because in this architecture a software system consisting of a large suite of services of fine granularity, each running its own process and communicating with the others. However, programming such systems is more complex. In this paper we report on CIDE, an integrated software development environment that helps with this. CIDE supports programming in a novel agent-oriented language called CAOPLE and tests their execution in a cluster environment. We present the architecture of CIDE, discuss its design based on the principles of the DevOps software development methodology, and describe facilities that support continuous testing and seamless integration, two other advantages of Microservices.",

This way employed the camera in mobile phone to acquire tomato disease leaf image in the greenhouse. Firstly, the detection system was built by the Eclipse based on the Android development environment. The iterative threshold segmentation algorithm was used to separate the tomato disease leaf area from background. And the fuzzy C-means cluster algorithm was adopted to extract the disease spots. After analyzed the impact of different fuzzy weighted index m value, the value of m was selected 2 for the disease spots segmentation. After that the tomato disease degree was determined based on the relevant standards and the total disease index of greenhouse was got based on disease index calculation standards. Finally, the calculating data could upload to the network server and was used by cloud management to achieve synchronous computer terminal query. The experimental results show that the detecting way could non-destructed measure the disease index of tomato leaf diseases with non-destructive and exact in greenhouse.",

        "Abstract": "5G is developed around its capability to integrate and support different industry verticals (health, manufacturing, media, automotive, IoT, smart cities) requirements, thus becoming a key enabler for new business opportunities and digital transformation. In the current paper we present an unique theoretical concept for the development, deployment and in-life management of a network aware Smart City 5G cloud native application using a three layer architecture. The existence of a marketplace is a key innovation of the architecture proposed and facilitates the development and management of the applications that will be instantiated over the programmable 5G infrastructure using the Service Mesh concept. The evolved Service Mesh is deployed in the form of a network slice, closely aware of the available network resources and tightly coupling the Orchestration Layer to the OSS/BSS from the Network function layer. By deploying this unified programmability model augmented by the creation of an open development environment for the application and virtual network functions developers, Matilda EU project facilitates the 5G adoption.",

        "Abstract": "To realize P4 language benefits: “Protocol Independent, Target Independent, Field Reconfigurable” [1] in a network research and development environment, a few P4 research institutions around the world formed a partnership to design and implement the international P4 Experimental Networks (Figure 1). The participating institutions can share distributed P4 resources over international research and education networks, as well as initiate international P4 research collaboration projects. Initial network scenarios in this research testbed are Software-Defined Network Exchanges (SDXs), Network and Cloud Testbed Networks, Science Networks, and Campus Research Networks. These four network scenarios require multi-tenant support. Current P4Runtime specifications include a Multi-Controller design for twofold: Control Plane Partition and Redundancy [2]. However, the current P4Runtime does not implement Control Plane partition to support multi-tenant service on a switch. This project modified the current design to support a provider and multiple tenant model for the four international P4 Experimental Networks (i-P4EN)scenarios and other applications.",

These applications generally aim to meet the growing demands of society in terms of power, water, gas, and lighting services. Although there are studies related to this area, technological developments in terms of both hardware and software lead to better solutions. In this study, an IoT application which is a key feature for a smart city service has been developed for street lighting. The developed application works with a light dependent resistor (LDR) and it controls a bulb according to the ambient light intensity. The control information is kept and analyzed in a cloud environment. Raspberry Pi development environment and Android Things operating system are used for realization of the system. Light bulb control and LDR hardware circuits have been developed within the scope of this study. With this study, a platform has been developed which can be realized at an affordable price to add additional sensors such as air pollution and humidity. Additionally, the easy development possibilities of the Android Things operating system have been examined.",

Response to query depends upon the speed of pattern matching, error correction, and resource allocation during query processing. The algorithms for query processing, sequence alignments of data from NCBI, EMBL, DDBJ and storage of recurring complex enquiries, are complicated and time consuming in the HADOOP framework. In order to obtain secure, swift and consistent response to queries, multi-agents have been introduced as a substitute for Job Tracker. They enhance the pace of query handling, allocate tasks to the Task Trackers, boost fault tolerance and increase reliability. Multi-Agents have also been deployed amid user and Agents, in the middle of Agents and between platforms to provide security measures. Agent development is done using JADE (Java Agent Development Environment) following the FIPA (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents) standards, using FIPA ACL (Agent Communication Language).",

        "Abstract": "In the emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT), wireless sensors are the vital mediators between the physical world and the cyber space. In many telemonitoring and interactive applications, high-rate data streams up to MB/s may need to be transported from the wireless sensors to the cloud computing servers over the Internet and processed by the remote servers in quasi-real time fashion. These applications generally demand substantial reduction of communication bandwidth, response latency and power consumption of these Internet-based cyber-physical systems. To tackle these demands for efficient use of communication, computing and power resources, we developed an advanced wearable sensor platform (AWSP) which integrated a powerful system-on-chip (SoC) processor, a smart power management unit, a highly accurate real-time clock and multi-function peripherals into a miniature module. This AWSP designed to function is capable of performing sophisticated data pre-processing including real-time artifact and noise removal, data compression, and even feature extraction before uploading the data to other devices like mobile phone, computer, etc. Furthermore, with the installation of embedded real-time Linux operating system, this sensor provides a familiar and powerful software development environment for system developers to build their computation-intensive real-time applications. This paper presents the design and development process.",

IoT opens a multi-dimensional system development environment before students, where they can interact with physical sensors/actuators, communication protocols, cloud technology, fogging technology, processing tools, and many other elements. TIoTA is used to stitch these elements together. In this paper, a template based IoT framework named Swift-IoT is proposed. It allows a beginner to develop small scale IoT system in half a month. This framework is derived using TIoTA and works using pedagogy as defined in Bloom's taxonomy. We tested this framework in a course offered at IIT Kanpur-2018 summer school. Total eighty students registered in half a month course. Twenty groups, each containing four members were formed. They were trained using this proposed framework, resulting in the development of twenty ready to use, high-quality, small scale IoT systems by the course end.",

It's thus possible to create a virtualized development environment that contains all the tools, applications, and libraries that a programmer requires. This speeds up developer setup time, brings economies of scale, introduces parity between development and production environments, allows the use of platform-specific tools, and simplifies embedded-system development. Using VMs, testers can ensure a pristine environment and access to diverse (virtual) platforms. Deployment is also simplified by packaging all the system's components and setup into a VM appliance. Finally, on the operations side, VMs make it easier for a system to support application provisioning, maintenance windows, high availability, and disaster recovery.",

        "Abstract": "Geostationary Ocean Color Imager-II (GOCI-II), the follow-up satellite sensor platform of GOCI, will be launched in Mar. 2019. For estimating ocean color information from this new sensor data, the dedicated ocean color algorithms will be newly developed. However, the existing ocean color algorithm development methodology without consideration for the highspeed data processing will not be employed because the amount of GOCI-II data will be significantly large and their data will have to be processed and distributed in real time. In this study, therefore, we designed the ocean color algorithm development environment (OCADE) to support high-performance computing and storage using the parallelism. Also, OCADE enables the source code projects for GOCI-II ocean color products to be automatically built and deployed. We expect that GOCI - II ocean color algorithm developers will easily create and manage their parallelized source code projects at any time and any place through the OCADE cloud service. Additionally, they will be able to validate the output and evaluate the processing performance under OCADE in real-time. We believe that OCADE will contribute to the field of massive satellite data processing.",

Docker containers have rapidly grown in popularity for dynamic cloud computing and for general-use application deployment and collaboration. Recent work comparing the performance of Docker versus VM deployments has found that Docker's reduced overhead results in better performance. We compare Docker versus VM deployments of an Apache Spark application in regard to ease of use in a collaborative development environment. We expect that developing the application in a containerized environment will result in fewer post-deployment tests that fail compared to application versions that are developed in non-virtual or VM environments. Future work will closely examine the performance of these two implementations and more generally investigate potential trade-offs between performance and ease of use.",

To save the cost of computation hardware, FPGAs are even made available by cloud service providers. To improve the flexibility of dynamic programming and reduce the FPGA compile time, a Partial Reconfiguration (PR) feature has been enabled in the FPGA development environment. PR is performed by FPGA CAD tools, which do not only provide new functionality for design programmers but also open new attack surfaces for adversaries. In this work, we first illustrate how PR can be used to thwart the attacks that facilitate reserve engineering and nullify the authentication module. We also analyze the potential security threats that PR could bring to FPGA design flow.",

        "Abstract": "Since the new technologies like big data and cloud computing require tremendous amount of transactions between processors and memory, researches on a new memory system called Processing in Memory (PIM) architecture has been suggested as a solution for those memory intensive applications. To make software utilize the new architecture, a development environment with tool chain and debug infrastructures supplementing extended instruction sets and target emulation is needed. This paper introduces a way to emulate a target platform having PIM architecture memory device. The emulated platform may use the PIM device as a system memory or simple memory mapped bus device. The actual PIM architecture is implemented in both cycle-based memory simulator and FPGA based hardware platform. The emulator has a bridge for these implementations so the emulated target platform may be freely used with early stage application development for the PIM architecture.",

These include soil erosion or salinization, damage from crop diseases, pests, and others. Timely and prompt identification of such situations is possible with the use of technical vision and methods of intellectual analysis and image processing. The most effective means of machine learning (ML) for such tasks are deep neural networks (DNN), primarily based on a parallel architecture containing convolutional layers of neurons. The purpose of the study was to build and study the effectiveness of DNN, which are used in intellectual land use tasks. The Python-based Google Collaboration cloud service, including ML libraries, was used as the DNN development environment.. When designing DNN, the features of the functioning of the CPU and GPU were taken into account. The results obtained make it possible to optimize the architecture and hyperparameters of DNN, as well as their training time. This approach increases the efficiency of the information and analytical complexes being developed to support the solution of various land use problems.",

        "Abstract": "Cyber security threats continue to grow on a daily basis with attacks coming from a wide range of sources including phishing, spear phishing, malware, ransomware, exploiting cloud vulnerabilities, Botnet, state-sponsored attacks, as well as others. Of the aforementioned, state-sponsored attacks not only pose a significant threat to western financial, educational and healthcare institutions, but also threaten the systems and data utilized by a wide range of government agencies and contractors. The military test community is not immune to these threats either with many currently deployed automatic test equipment (ATE) implementations, across the various maintenance levels from the flightline to the depot, being increasingly vulnerable. A growing number of Organizational Level (O-Level) test sets are now exposed to cyber threats as their architectures and interfaces continue to evolve to meet the ever-growing need for increased processing power and measurement performance. Further, O-Level test sets typically connect to the platform (i.e. aircraft) and as such, pose a much greater cyber-security threat. Physical threats have always existed, even for previous generations of test sets, but the nature of the vulnerabilities has largely shifted to new types of interfaces. Replacing legacy test sets, that were deployed with limited external connectivity and data storage capabilities, with advanced processor-based implementations exposes them to a new set of cyber security concerns including possible vulnerabilities with the operating system, the test development environment, the test executive (sequencer) as well as threats from other new interfaces that could possibly be exploited. This paper will delve into these and other possible vulnerabilities with modern O-Level test set implementations, including the impact from the underlying hardware and software architectures. It will discuss the Department of Defense (DOD) Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) for devices and systems and identify where the STIG requirements apply to O-Level test sets. The analysis will include aspects such as file protections, access control, data encryption, activity logs, user group accounts and privileges, test program set (TPS) event logging and others. The analysis will also cover cyber security benefits from utilizing a cyber-approved integrated test development and test executive environment, and identify techniques to maximize the proper protections for current and future deployments.",

        "Abstract": "When the patients are hospitalised, they put their faith in medical professionals to take good care of them while they are vulnerable and in pain. Receiving IV through fluids is one of the features for being hospitalised. In the large setups like hospital, a doctor may have to attend several patients and is a huge task for a single person to keep updated about each patient's IV bottle level. Despite of being careful, as the nurse has a tight schedule, he/she may tend to forget to change the IV bottle timely which may cause air bubbles to center the patient's blood system or reverse blood flow to the IV/electrolyte bottle may be caused which leads to complications. To elude this, an IOT based device is proposed which uses an advanced technology where the weight data of the IV bottle has been fed to the cloud through NodeMCU microcontroller. This project aims to inform the nurse about the IV bottle level through wireless. Using android studio and fire base which belong to development environment, an app is created. The app displays the level of IV bottle while providing the details of the patient. It raises an alarm if the weight of the bottle is below a specified limit and also communicates to the respective doctor or the caretaker by means of an SMS, indicating the room number of the patient.",

        "Abstract": "With the development of the fourth industrial revolution, digital technologies centered on cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, mobile Internet, and artificial intelligence are moving towards people's vision. In the era of digital economy, the development of power grids has accelerated and the elements of the system have changed more, and the traditional grid planning methods are no longer applicable to the development environment of power grids at this stage. In this paper, digital twins are introduced into power grid planning, and a framework and process of power grid planning based on digital twins are constructed to change the inherent methodology of power grid planning from the perspective of top-level design. The aim of this paper is to give a solution to the new trend of grid planning through the construction of a framework. The digital twins enables the grid to adapt to rapid changes in the environment through real-time interaction between the digital and physical worlds. Relevant digital twins platforms are also presented, including Azure, Maple, Simulink, etc. The paper also provides an outlook on the application of digital twins in grid planning, describing the advantages, difficulties and development trends of the application.",

        "Abstract": "Modern cloud-edge-device computational platforms does not match the needs of artificial intelligence at the edge of the network. Indeed, the lack of computing power allows that only some AI processes can be performed on edge devices, having also to consider their constrained energy capacity. Moreover, the lack of computing continuum between nodes of the same layer, i.e., edge-to-edge, allows to only operate independently within the layer by sensing the environment where nodes stay. In this paper, we propose a lightweight framework for collaborative nodes with decentralized edge intelligence. Organized like a swarm, the groups of nodes emphasize the edge-to-edge continuum of the device-edge-cloud paradigm. This supports a paradigm shift from programming environments for individual devices to dynamic and cooperating groups of nodes. The nodes’ coordination relays on green overlay and offloading mechanisms. Innovative mesh architectures with mixed topologies allow building overlays for having swarm coordination. Tasks offloading exploits the overlays to balance the swarm in near-real-time, according to forecasted energy consumption. Stemming from the proposed reference architecture, we also discuss a series of open challenges, which we believe represent relevant research directions in the nearest future.",

Using a geometric world model, minimum distances and nearest points between parts of the active dexterous 7-DOF manipulator and potential obstacles are computed by the Ranger obstacle detection software. Obstacle data is then used to compute virtual repulsive forces which perturb the operator-commanded manipulator Cartesian motions in order to avoid collisions. The virtual forces are computed at the tool-tip for end-effector position perturbation, at the wrist for end-effector orientation perturbation, and on the upper and lower arm links for arm angle perturbation. The paper also describes the software development environment, utilizing a 3D graphical simulation and providing a graphical user interface for display and operator command. Results of several test runs illustrating end-effector position and orientation perturbation, as well as arm angle perturbation, are presented.",

        "Abstract": "CanSat Leader Training Program (CLTP) has been held in Japan from 14th February to 14th March 2011. This program is designed for researchers and educators in space engineering to learn the basic concept of space education, and also to experience practical hands-on training, system engineering, project management and teamwork. Participants are 12 and from 10 countries this year: Turkey, Mexico, Guatemala, Peru, Sri Lanka, Australia, Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt and Vietnam. A microcontroller module called mbed was used for the main computer, as it has online development environment as well as quite a few libraries for users to get used to it rapidly. In the first week, starting with lecture of mbed, three teams built very simple CanSats. The CanSats were launched by model rocket (2m long and goes up to the altitude of 350m) in Kada, Wakayama. Advanced level “come-back” CanSats were built in the rest of the weeks. Unfortunately, those CanSats were not launched due to the earthquake in Japan on 11th March 2011. However, CLTP ended successfully as they all experienced the primary purposes of this program. Instruction material of space education focused on CanSat is now in progress, and it is going to be tailored and translated into the version of respective countries. The basic concept of space education, the background of CLTP, and the detailed contents of program are explained in this paper.",

The hardware of the controller is based on PC/104 cards under Linux-RTAI operating system. The main characteristic of Matlab/RTW is that it can automatically generate the real-time simulation code for many target processors. The combination of Linux-RTAI as a controller platform and Matlab/RTW as control algorithm development environment brings the two main advantages: hard real-time capability and reduced time for control development. Moreover, online signal monitor and parameter modification is realized on the whole structure system. At last, the minimum execution time of real-time control task is determined and the application of real-time control system into flight vehicle is achieved in the work.",

        "Abstract": "The essence of the online Delphi method is multiple round interviews of an expert group who answer questions in a structured e-survey and verify hypotheses called Delphi statements or questions. These can be defined by the client contracting the study or the core experts employed by the Delphi supplier, usually a consulting or research institution. The questions can have various forms: binary (\"yes/no\"), qualitative - Likert-scale-valued, or quantitative. A flexible survey system should offer a variety of question and/or statement types, as well as a user-friendly interface to reply or verify them. Additionally, the replies should be analyzed by strict statistical and uncertainty handling methods to yield consistent recommendations to the survey stakeholders. The `decision Delphi' is a survey variant that corresponds most strictly to the needs of organizations that look for expert knowledge concerning specific technological, market or other business problems. This type of survey also fits the needs of medical research on future therapy, epidemics, health care issues, etc. Its characteristic feature is the participation of the client's staff or the decision makers themselves. The cloud-based application ForgnosisTM is a modern implementation of a decision Delphi endowed with sophisticated analytic features. We will present its capabilities based on a recent survey and analysis case carried out for the EU Horizon 2020 flagship project MOVING. This system is offered in SaaS mode, with some PaaS functionalities. The latter include a variety of programming tools for designing the organization's customized survey.",

        "Abstract": "End-user training is complicated to implement in global corporations whose activities are typically scattered across multiple sites in different countries and leverage information systems in various ways. This is especially true in global software development where the sites may leverage a development tool for totally different purposes. Web-based Virtual Meeting Tools (VMT) enable synchronous communication globally through interactive audio, online chats, video, and the sharing of presentations. They provide potentially a cost effective way to train even complex topics to large numbers of people in global settings. Few industrial experiences from the design and use of VMT-based training innovations have been reported. This paper draws upon a case study in a global corporation to describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of a training innovation, consisting of a set of courses delivered by means of a VMT and conference calls, to support the global deployment of a Unified Modeling Language (UML) modeling tool and to develop UML modeling skills. Evaluation is based on interviews to verify 1) the impacts of the innovation on skills, knowledge and motivation, 2) perceived learner satisfaction with respect to the innovation. The innovation proved successful in improving skills, knowledge, and motivation in the case organization and learners were satisfied with it. Other organizations may benefit from using VMT to train people to use similar complex information systems for supporting global software development.",

        "Abstract": "Presents a neurocontroller development environment using the ideas of adaptive inverse control. The goal of the paper is to describe the environment utilized and show a very simple example. A PC running a commercial simulator communicates in real-time with a /spl mu/controller to learn how to control the power supply of a motor using the speed as input. This /spl mu/controller runs a feedforward neural network online, but the weights are adapted periodically off-line by the simulator and downloaded once the weights stabilize. The user interacts with the user interface of the commercial package to define the topology, to test the adequacy of the control topology and to set the control parameters.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents a real-time development interface for motor control, embedded in a single board (MCB). The MCB's CPU is an ARM Cortex- A8 supporting EtherCAT implementation. This CPU computes the control algorithm that can be implemented with Matlab/Simulink toolchain. The host PC that runs Matlab environment is able to connect to the running code via EtherCAT bus by use of Ethernet over EtherCAT (EoE) directly. Via external mode the developer is able to monitor all Simulink signals of the deployed model on hardware board during runtime. Manipulation of constant block values is also feasible to e.g. investigate on different controller parameters online. The actual prototype board is fully functional and will now be miniaturized to fit into a modular drive unit. With this unit complex multi-axis systems can be installed, monitored and investigated by simply attaching EtherCAT communication bus and single power supply voltage. Thanks to Simulink development environment the controller code development is very efficient. Since the hardware is reduced to mass electronics components the cost is acceptable.",

In this study, we investigate the influence of the geographical location on the evaluation of pull requests in GitHub - the most popular online collaborative code development environment. We use a mixed-methods approach and present analyses of 70,000+ pull requests and 2,500+ survey responses. Quantitative analysis of GitHub projects' data suggests that the geographical location significantly explains the pull request acceptance decisions. These observations are in agreement with the perceptions of submitters based on their experiences with bias. Integrators feel that it is easy to work with contributors from the same geographical location and that they encourage contributors from the same geographical location. However, integrators do not feel that contributors from some countries are better at writing pull requests compared to others.",

In some areas such as medicine, engineering, human interaction practice is crucial since it is a basis of the specialists’ knowledge.The article covers the development of the software application to provide medical students with a tool that will show pathologies of the cardiovascular system. The complex consists of two modules. The first contains a scene consisting of a 3D heart model. It shows four different pathologies of the heart. The second scene is dedicated to laparoscopic surgery with stenting of coronary vessels. To simulate interaction during laparoscopic surgery Leap Motion controller was used. The instrumental basis of the project for 3d modeling is Blender, the project’s development environment is Unity 3D game engine. All the scripts describing the application’s logic were written in the C# programming language.",

Based on USB serial communication protocol, the computer data acquisition hardware platform of three-dimensional machining force measurement and analysis system is built. The measurement and analysis software system is developed under Microsoft visual studio development environment, which includes several function software packages, such as turning force testing software package, milling force testing software package, grinding force testing software package, drilling force testing software package. With these software packages, machining force of different processing types could be monitored online and processed offline both in time domain and in frequency domain. The machining force regression models could be established by using single factor analysis method. The three-dimensional milling force testing experiments results show that the flexible testing and analysis system could meet the three-dimensional cutting test of different processes, and the regression models coincide with the cutting force variation law. Meanwhile the testing system is very flexible, which could adapt to different process and different force sensors and also could meet any general current or voltage signal test.",

In order to adapt to the new situation and make full use of modern infrastructure, online teaching evaluation will become the mainstream form of school evaluation. This system adopts the B/S system structure and GLR algorithm, introduces each functional module, GLR algorithm, and comprehensive evaluation model of the system in detail, and then designs the software and hardware development environment of the system. Finally, through the B/S system structure and GLR The application of the algorithmic English teaching comprehensive evaluation syntax analyzer finally realizes the function of the teacher evaluation management module. The system test shows that the query evaluation data in the comprehensive English teaching evaluation of the system meets the requirements, and the modified evaluation data can be entered normally and the data can be deleted normally. The comprehensive evaluation data is calculated correctly, which further shows that the system has excellent applicable value.",

        "Abstract": "Software engineering projects are inherently cooperative, requiring many software engineers to coordinate their efforts to produce a large software system. Integral to this effort is developing shared understanding surrounding multiple artifacts, each artifact embodying its own model, over the entire development process. This focus on model- oriented collaboration embedded within a larger process is what distinguishes collaboration research in software engineering from broader collaboration research, which tends to address artifact-neutral coordination technologies and toolkits. This article first presents a list of goals for software engineering collaboration, then surveys existing collaboration support tools in software engineering. The survey covers both tools that focus on a single artifact or stage in the development process (requirements support tools, UML collaboration tools), and tools that support the representation and execution of an entire software process. Important collaboration standards are also described. Several possible future directions for collaboration in software engineering are presented, including tight integration between web and desktop development environments, broader participation by customers and end users in the entire development process, capturing argumentation surrounding design rationale, and use of massively multiplayer online (MMO) game technology as a collaboration medium. The article concludes by noting a problem in performing research on collaborative systems, that of assessing how well certain artifacts, models, and embedded processes work, and whether they are better than other approaches.",

        "Abstract": "Virtualization is the nucleus of the cloud computing for providing its services on-demand. Cloud-based distributed systems are predominantly developed using virtualization technology. However, the requirement of significant resources and issues of interoperability and deployment make it less adopt- able in the development of many types of distributed systems. Dockerization or Docker Container-based virtualization has been introduced in the last three years and gaining popularity in the software development community. Docker has recently introduced its distributed system development tool called Swarm, which extends the Docker Container-based system development process on multiple hosts in multiple clouds. Docker Swarm-based containerized distributed system is a brand new approach and needs to be compared with the virtualized distributed system. Therefore, this paper presents the simulation and evaluation of the development of a distributed system using virtualization and dockerization. This simulation is based on Docker Swarm, VirtualBox, Ubuntu, Mac OS X, nginx and redis. To simulate and evaluate the distributed system in the same environment, all Swarm Nodes and Virtual Machines are created using VirtualBox on the same Mac OS X host. For making this evaluation rational, almost similar system resources are allocated to both at the beginning. Subsequently, similar servers nginx and redis are installed on the Swarm Node and Virtual Machine. Finally, based on the experimental simulation results, it evaluates their required resources and operational overheads; thus, their performance and effectiveness for designing distributed systems.",

        "Abstract": "Smart City services' effectiveness is enabled by the integration and availability of data coming from city operators on different domains: mobility, energy, health, water, telecom, tourism, culture, etc. They may be open and private data, static and real time. The most cases, smart city developers still have to develop their applications by studying several data sets and API sources, recovering the data models, reconciliating and aggregating data manually, creating applications exploiting low level Web Service and/or REST Call without the support of development tools, and neither of a semantic data aggregator. In this paper, an innovative tool for smart city web and mobile Apps development is presented. It exploits the Km4City data aggregator and semantic model, and includes: (i) tools for assisting developers for generating calls to Smart City API via visual queries on a graphical user interface; and (ii) open source Apps Development Kit for shortening the development. Finally, the paper reports about experimental results performed in the usage of the tool in the context of a large national project called Sii-Mobility which involved several developers. The same approach is presently adopted by other large projects as well.",

The first controlled experiment was conducted within an academic research laboratory with master students in Computer Science at the University of Salerno, while a replicated experiment was conducted in the laboratory of our partner company with both professional programmers and academic researchers. The results revealed that the use of MELIS decrease the time to migrate legacy systems to the web with respect to the use of traditional development tools. Also, less expert software engineers benefit more of the use of MELIS.",

        "Abstract": "E-commerce websites have made everyone’s lives simpler in the current date due to the luxury provided by them of getting almost anything delivered at the doorstep at any time required. There are also websites that provide the same advantage to order medicines whenever needed. The drawback of such websites is that the prescription is not verified on those. A prescription is the most important component when it comes to buying prescription based drugs. The proposed work aims to develop an e-commerce website that offers medicines and drugs with the feature of connecting the customers with their doctors using simple web development tools. Also, the doctors will be able to write the prescriptions via this website for their patients. The customers can use this prescription to order medicines for themselves safely or can use the same prescription to order medicines from their local chemist. A prescription parser will be created to check the prescriptions by using the python-docx, docx2pdf module of Python. These prescriptions will be signed and verified using the RSA algorithm. For this, the rsa module of python will be used. The encryption of the prescriptions will be done using the ‘SHA-512’ hash module. This website will be deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) due to their low cost in their services, flexibility, security and pay-as-you-go pricing. The services used for the same will be EC2, RDS, S3. Also, a round of Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) will be performed on the website to remove the vulnerabilities and reduce the chances of Ethical Hacking.",

        "Abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) increasingly enable the interaction of the physical world with services, which may be located across the Internet from the sensing network. Cloud services and big data approaches may be used to store and analyse this data to improve scalability and availability, which will be required for the billions of devices envisaged in the Internet of Things (IoT). This potential of WSNs is limited by the relatively low number deployed and the difficulties imposed by their heterogeneous nature and limited (or proprietary) development environments and interfaces. This paper proposes a set of requirements for achieving a pervasive, integrated information system of WSNs and associated services. It also presents an architecture which provides a set of abstractions for the different types of sensors and services, enabling them to take advantage of Big Data and cloud technologies and which is termed holistic as it caters for the data flow from sensors through to services. The architecture has been designed for implementation on a resource constrained node and to be extensible to server environments, shown in this paper where we present a 'C' implementation of the core architecture, including services on Linux and Contiki (using the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)) and a Linux service to integrate with the Hadoop HBase data store.",

        "Abstract": "Increasing complexity of systems and software in the automotive industry, coupled with distributed development environments has intensified adoption of Software in the Loop (SIL) systems, i.e. setup where traditional hardware components are designed and tested in pure virtual PC/IT environment consisting of virtualized hardware and networks. Cloud-based SiL simulation systems involving multiple contributors and orchestrators create huge risks for organizations due to potential for leakage of confidential model-IP to adversaries within the distributed infrastructure. This can create a bottleneck for wide-scale adoption of SiL-systems. We propose a data-flow architecture using trusted-computing technologies (e.g. Intel-SGX) to protect models and IP in cloud-based SiL environments. We illustrate that these protections can be designed to be compatible with existing SiL tools and workflows with minimal modifications. Further, we highlight the need for future standardization efforts of such security architectures in the SiL domain.",

To solve the problems of huge area overhead and circuit delay in EHW based on the virtual reconfigurable circuit, the technology of dynamic partial reconfiguration of modern SRAM-based Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) is applied to EHW to implement online evolution in this paper. Based on the technology of early access to partial reconfiguration provided by Xilinx, an evolvable IP core is customized. With EA implemented on the on-chip soft processor, a self-evolving system based on system on a programmable chip is designed for the online evolution of digital image filters. The Xilinx FPGA development tool, ISE12.4, is used to complete the design, and the Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA development board, ML507, is used to verify the feasibility of the system structure and the self-evolving mechanism.",

        "Abstract": "The Philippine Coral Reef exhibit within the California Academy of Sciences contains on the order of 100 species of fish and over 1,000 fish. It has multiple visual and auditory aids to help its viewers undertake a more engaged position with respect to it, e.g. live video feeds, kiosks as well as live dive shows in order to educate the audience on both the marine ecosystem represented by the exhibit and the importance of conservation. However, there is little aid that gives the audience live and accurate feedback on the species of fish in front of them. It is difficult as a lay person (often even as a professional) to determine the species of fish they are viewing in the exhibit due to the large number of fish species and fish specimens. This shortcoming is poorly addressed in public aquariums and remains an important issue to properly educate visitors on issues such as conservation and ecological diversity. To facilitate solutions to these problems, we present Aquaeye.ai, a platform completed in March 2021, that has taken steps towards greater public engagement and outreach at public aquariums by providing a suite of perception analytics currently including localization and classification for the environments of public aquariums. Using advancements in object recognition and classification for imagery and video data, the practice of transfer learning and modern web development tools, Aquaeye.ai, a cloud-hosted platform, serves models for localization and species classification of fish within the Reef Lagoon exhibit at the California Academy of Sciences (*) using a live webcam of the exhibit. Additionally, it serves data of relevance to ecology and conservation through a simple and powerful interface. We present our curated datasets of and classification/localization models for the fish species within the Reef Lagoon and Philippine Coral Reef exhibits.",

        "Abstract": "We propose a specification-driven approach to Web service composition. The proposed framework allows users to start with a high-level, possibly incomplete specification of a desired (goal) service that is to be realized using a subset of the available component services. These services are represented by the system using transition systems augmented with guards over variables with infinite domains and are used to determine a strategy for their composition that would realize the goal service. In the event that the goal service cannot be realized using the available services, the system identifies the cause(s) for such failure which can then be used by the developer to reformulate the goal specification. Thus, the system supports Web service composition through iterative refinement of the functional specifications. We present a prototype implementation in tabled-logic programming environment that illustrates the key features of the proposed approach",

        "Abstract": "There is a notable overlap of the challenges with which the semantic technologies and software engineering deal. They can also complement and mutually improve each other. Current efforts mostly focus on improving software tools around the resource description framework (RDF) and Web Ontology Language (OWL) Web-oriented ecosystem that helps ontology engineers but is alien to software engineers. This paper presents an opposite approach taken from the software developer's viewpoint - an incorporation of the ontology paradigm into a general-purpose programming language, in a simple and agile way, on a small scale, and in an unpretentious manner. The objective is to help programmers write simple domain-driven code with richer semantics. The means to achieve this objective relies on metaprogramming to internalize the ontology modeling paradigm into a mainstream programming environment based on the Java ecosystem, in a lightweight manner suitable for small teams. An embedded meta domain-specific language (DSL), which is called Magic Potion, is implemented in Clojure and blends ontology, functional, object-oriented, and concurrent paradigms. An example from the technology enhanced learning (TEL) domain is used to illustrate Magic Potion in action.",

        "Abstract": "It gains more and more attentions on how to enable users to dynamically construct and reconstruct Web applications of information convergence in run time to resolving urgent and unplanned business requirements. Visual programming environment, information resources virtualization and management, and visual representation of user-defined applications are important and challenging issues in dynamically constructing these applications. To address these needs, a service-portlet based visual paradigm is proposed to support dynamically constructing Web application of information resources convergence. Information resources are represented by portlets in a portal container to hide programming details of accessing and communicating with information resources. Users can select and set collaborations patterns between these information portlets to construct applications of information convergence. In phrase of execution, these applications are translated into convergent scripts which are transparent for users and executed by a script engine and convergent results generated by the engine are represented again by a portlet before users. A proof-of-concept prototype is developed and tested to demonstrate the utility of the proposed paradigm.",

        "Abstract": "Virtual Reality (VR) content development tools are in continuous production by both enthusiastic researchers and software development companies. Yet, learners could benefit from participating in this development, not only for learning vital programming skills, but also skills in creativity and collaboration. Web-based VR (WebVR) has emerged as a platform-independent framework that permits individuals (with little to no prior programming experience) to create immersive and interactive VR applications. Yet, the success of WebVR relies on students' technological acceptance, the intersectionality of perceived utility and ease of use. In order to determine the effectiveness of the emerging tool for learners of varied experience levels, this paper presents a case study of 38 students who were tasked with developing WebVR 'dream' houses. Results showed that students were accepting of the technology by not only learning and implementing WebVR in a short time (one month), but were also capable of demonstrating creativity and problem-solving skills with classroom supports (i.e., pre-project presentations, online discussions, exemplary projects, and TA support). Results as well as recommendations, lessons learned, and further research are addressed.",

        "Abstract": "Cyberlearning is challenged by the lack of personal and assessment-driven learning, and students are often puzzled by the lack of instructor guidance and feedback, the huge volume and diversity of the learning materials, and thelack of the ability to zoom in from the general concepts to the more specific ones, or the opposite. Intelligent tutoring systems are needed to improve the cyberlearning quality. One of the major difficulties is knowledge representation. The current industry standard is to use Web Ontology Language (OWL) for representing knowledge structure. But OWL only supports one \"first-class\" relation, \"is-a\", between the concepts, and different knowledge areas usually need different custom relations to describe the relations among the concepts. For example \"part-of\" and time dependency are important relations torepresent most engineering knowledge bodies. OWL has to use object properties to emulate such custom relations, leading to awkward knowledge representation hard for domain experts to code, validate and use such knowledge bases. This research uses Pace University's extension to OWL, named Knowledge Graph (KG), to support knowledge representation with custom relations. The instructors can use Pace University extended Protege IDE to declare and apply custom relations in a single document. The instructor teaching experience is also coded in the KG to better support custom learning order by students with different backgrounds. The prototype of a knowledge-driven tutoring system was designed and implemented to illustrate how the KG supports integrated assessments, using assessment results to custom student learning order or material, and let the students freely navigate in the knowledge space from general to specific or the opposite, and following various custom relations. A web technology tutorial is used to validate the design and effectiveness of this approach.",

        "Abstract": "Voting is synonymous with general elections especially for countries with democratic system. In an effort to slow down the spread of Covid-19, there is a significant rise in digitalization, and this includes voting. However, concerns regarding security and integrity of the entire system have been raised. The implementation of blockchain in voting is believed can help alleviate the issues raised since blockchain are immutable and decentralized. The usage of smart contract that stores states and run when certain conditions are met can get rid of the possibility of database manipulation while still maintaining anonymity. Unfortunately, implementing an Ethereum-based blockchain is expensive as each transaction cost can cost up to thousands of US dollar. Hence, this study focuses on developing an E-Voting blockchain based prototype using a local chain platform that performs the same operations as blockchain but uses a fake currency which results in a more feasible and cost-effective result. In this context, the objectives of this study were to design and develop the smart contract that satisfies the voting requirement and lastly; to evaluate the performance and security of the developed smart contract; to test the functionality of this study’s prototype. The prototype of this study was developed using a combination of Web 2.0, PHP, MySQL, Express.js and Web 3.0, specifically Ganache, Remix IDE and MetaMask. After the development and integration phases, the prototype was evaluated and validated using unit testing, which tested each function and modules individually before being integrated to ensure full functionality of each module. A total of 20 voters were gathered to test the prototype for the user acceptance testing section of the prototype of this study which shows the viability and usability of the product. E-Voting blockchain based prototype successfully achieved the objectives and solved the problems stated in the proposal. Despite the limitations, there are still expected future works to improve the system in future. Blockchain technology has the potential to grow gradually over the next few years and its technological complexity will be able to be adapted by the users.",

This might lead to faster and lower-cost program testing and enhancement, especially in terms of usability and interaction. In this work we propose a method for using deep learning approaches such as recurrent neural networks (RNN) and generative adversarial neural networks (GANN) to produce high-quality weblogs. Eventually, we can utilize the created data for automated testing and improvement of Web sites prior to their release with the aid of model-driven development tools such as IFML Editor.",

The core object model, named as secure mobile beans (SMB), can be deployed into the cloud server. Our framework consists of SMB models, object-relation mapping module, SMB translator, and development tools. The use cases show that it can free developers from the complex implementation of security policies during the development stages, shorten the time of mobile application's development effectively.",

        "Abstract": "Modern farming is experiencing increased adoption of mobile and cloud computing applications as efforts are being made to automate farming processes. In this context, the mobile and cloud computing applications, that we refer to as smart agriculture applications (SAAs), can be used in data collection that can be entered directly into the applications by end-users (i.e., farmers) or via sensors. Implementing SAAs is often done using text-based approaches that require advanced skills and experience in software programming. There are low-code development tools (LCDTs) that farmers with less programming experience can use to implement their own SAAs. The LCDTs offer different features and techniques for application development e.g., some employ form-based application specification while others use graphical drag-and-drop techniques. As such, the different LCDTs are best suited for different specific tasks. For instance, a farmer may need to implement an application that connects to sensors to receive data and generate timely notifications when set thresholds are exceeded. However, to the farmer, it can be difficult to know which kind of LCDTs to choose and what category of these tools are best suited for the task. In this paper, we contrast different LCDTs and show how to use DisCoPar to develop SAAs by non-expert programmers. As a contribution, this paper presents properties for LCDTs that can be beneficial to farmers and demonstrates how DisCoPar can be used in developing SAAs.",

In addition to reading information from sensors, an operator interface in the form of a web page was also developed, and the recording of measured values into a database for further processing was provided. Data is stored on a memory device in the form of tables unified with data processing programs. There is a possibility of storing files in the cloud and remote control of technological processes. Also the software provides for address polling of sensors, which makes it possible to evaluate the change in the monitored parameter at the location of the sensor. With the help of IoT technology there is a possibility to control and manage biotechnical objects.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper we describe tool support for a model-based approach to verifying compositions of Web service implementations. The tool supports verification of properties created from design specifications and implementation models to confirm expected results from the viewpoints of both the designer and implementer. Scenarios are modeled in UML, in the form of message sequence charts (MSCs), and then compiled into the finite state process (FSP) algebra to concisely model the required behavior. BPEL4WS implementations are mechanically translated to FSP to allow an equivalence trace verification process to be performed. By providing early design verification and validation, the implementation, testing and deployment of Web service compositions can be eased through the understanding of the behavior exhibited by the composition. The tool is implemented as a plug-in for the Eclipse development environment providing cooperating tools for specification, formal modeling and trace animation of the composition process.",

        "Abstract": "This paper provides an overview of several initiatives leading to the next generation of ATE and notes that the single biggest problem in ATE today is not the incorporation of advancing technology to achieve ever higher test capabilities in newly fielded ATE, rather it is the management of legacy and new ATE over a twenty year or more life cycle. This paper discusses the benefit of creation of logistically compatible testers. Logistics compatibility is obtained by identifying common test capabilities of current unique testers and consolidating those test requirements into common test resources. Adding to the common test resources is the savings/benefits through the implementation of an evolving Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard which allows multiple sized interface test adapters (ITAs) to work with different ATE. The IEEE-PI 505 receiver-fixture interface2 directly supports a compatible family of testers concept. The paper notes there are several enabling technologies evolving in the industry that facilitate the common instrument approach such as virtual or synthetic instruments (SI), programmable bus emulators or bus simulators. These have the flexibility to consolidate large numbers of obsolete, unique communications cards into a single test equipment asset. This paper also discusses the advances in software technology that will become prevalent in future ATE. Maintenance of test programs can be complicated and costly when using multiple operating systems and multiple test languages. Consolidation of the test language and operating system into an easy-to-use, COTS-based software development environment reduces recurring maintenance and training costs. Network-centric ATE approaches are also considered in this paper with the benefits provided. The use of network and Web-based management of tester software and TPSs is noted as a great benefit in the reduction of software maintenance costs. Use of a network connection and even the Internet allows software and on-line manuals to be managed in one location and provides for automatic updates, guaranteeing the use of the latest official versions of manuals and software. The paper also discusses that Network and Web-based testers allow for information flow in the other direction, thus facilitating a centralized database to collect UUT failure data for tracking repair piece parts and for determining high failure rate issues and/or UUT repair history. The final factor noted in this paper is the use of standards that provide for interfaces that are common and inter-operable across the industry. All the concepts presented form the anatomy of viable future ATE systems. If these concepts are not implemented in ATE designs, we as tax payers will continue to foot the bill for costly band-aid solutions in support of the war fighter.",

        "Abstract": "UNDERSTANDER is an exploratory R&D project investigating Business Intelligence (BI) as a knowledge-gathering tool for supporting innovation processes in specific industrial domains. We develop a knowledge-based model that is grounded on the following three concepts: (i) Business Intelligence Model (BIM) developed by a Canadian project for BI technologies, (ii) taxonomy of Competitive Intelligence (CI) developed by CI practitioners, and (iii) Conceptual Dependency (CD) theory dealing with verb-oriented organization of knowledge. We also investigate whether knowledge-based models can be made adequate for the problem of gathering BI from web resources. Such a knowledge model can be used to “prime” a software agent and the agent can then search autonomously for relevant information on the Web. To express the interaction between agents, we consider “mechanism design”, which is a framework for designing interaction between self-interested agents to achieve specific outcomes. A BI Seeker is a multi-agent application developed in WADE. (Workflows and Agents Development Environment). WADE is an extension of JADE, a popular Open Source framework that brings workflow mechanisms to agents. We present the design of the BI Seeker as an application in the field of Industrial Internet.",

        "Abstract": "In the last few years, the paradigms used to create new business applications is deeply changed. As matter of fact, the service providers turned their old approach create from scratch whatever we need into a new one: look for and integrate. In this brand new scenario, the key role is played by the interoperability: indeed it is required that each time a new service is deployed and once the interfaces are defined, the client does not need any further information to make use of the service. The service oriented architecture (SOA) aims at providing a structure that guarantees the transparency and the interoperability between service providers and service requestors. Even if the SOA is widely diffused, its performances evaluation is still an open problem: due to transparency of the architecture, it is very hard for application/service developers to have quantitative performance evaluation at any development stages. In this context, we will give an answer to the following question: given a newly developed service, built in a closed development environment, how to predict its performance on a hosted service platform (for example in order to choice between two available platforms or to fine tune it in the contest of a large SOA application)? In this paper we propose a technique for semiautomatic building of performance models of Web service platforms, which we model as instantaneous load dependent servers (iLDS): servers whose service time depends on the workload at a given time. The approach we propose, adopts a black box measurement technique, this means that we can just deploy a service, but we have no access to the underlying server platform configuration both for software and hardware layers. The resulting model can be used by final user or service developers to predict the service behaviour respect to a known workload or to compare different web service platforms. The proposed approach was validated on a simple case study and the measurements put in evidence an interesting result about the common behavior of instantaneous load dependent servers, which can be of general use for modeling this class of systems.",

For systems, we present a scale-out system loosely coupling 16 single-chip boards and a scale-up system tightly integrating 16 chips in a 4 × 4 configuration by exploiting TrueNorth's native tiling. For software, we present an end-to-end ecosystem consisting of a simulator, a programming language, an integrated programming environment, a library of algorithms and applications, firmware, tools for deep learning, a teaching curriculum, and cloud enablement. For the scale-up systems we summarize our approach to physical placement of neural network, to reduce intra- and inter-chip network traffic. The ecosystem is in use at over 30 universities and government/corporate labs. Our platform is a substrate for a spectrum of applications from mobile and embedded computing to cloud and supercomputers.",

        "Abstract": "Businesses started to exploit the forthcoming value from deployment of cloud computing as a new caterpillar paradigm to reach out more diversified customer slices. Although the general concepts they practically focus on are: viability, survivability, adaptability, etc., however, on the ground, there is still a lack for forming mechanisms to sustain viability with adaptation of new types of requirements that pertain to other un-tackled aspects of the echosystem. Such aspects like social intentionality are of actors and their goals. This paper introduces modern dynamic software programming environment aided with modelling support to achieve operationalization and adaptation of abstract object; goals and their properties as formation of new type of requirements into service based applications distributed over the cloud. This will in turn provide system runtime components to interactively confer to guarantee self-adaptive behaviour with respect to its functional and non-functional characteristics.",

This is because these activities usually involve multiple stakeholders that include business domain experts, security experts, web service developers and IT operations teams, and there is no streamlined development environment to allow these stakeholders to work collaboratively on a business process. We have developed a cloud-based model-driven development and execution environment called SSC4Cloud to provide a shared business process modeling workspace and a business process execution environment. More specifically, with the shared modeling workspace, business process models can be developed, refined and shared. Within the shared execution environment, a business process model is translated into a WS-BPEL based executable model, which is then assigned for execution in a virtual machine container from a shared machine cluster. The common model execution environment supports both business process execution and enforcement of the security requirements attached to the business process models.",

        "Abstract": "The paper introduces a visual programming language and corresponding web- and cloud-based development environment called NetsBlox. NetsBlox is an extension of Snap! and it builds upon its visual formalism as well as its open source code base. NetsBlox adds distributed programming capabilities to Snap! by introducing two simple abstractions: messages and NetsBlox services. Messages containing data can be exchanged by two or more NetsBlox programs running on different computers connected to the Internet. Services are called on a client program and are executed on the NetsBlox server. These two abstractions make it possible to create distributed programs, for example multi-player games or client-server applications. We believe that NetsBlox provides increased motivation to high-school students to become creators and not just consumers of technology. At the same time, it helps teach them basic distributed programming concepts.",

        "Abstract": "Manufacturing and environmental variations cause timing errors in microelectronic processors that are typically avoided by ultra-conservative multi-corner design margins or corrected by error detection and recovery mechanisms at the circuit-level. In contrast, we present here runtime software support for cost-effective countermeasures against hardware timing failures during system operation. We propose a variability-aware OpenMP (VOMP) programming environment, suitable for tightly-coupled shared memory processor clusters, that relies upon modeling across the hardware/software interface. VOMP is implemented as an extension to the OpenMP v3.0 programming model that covers various parallel constructs, including task, sections, and for. Using the notion of work-unit vulnerability (WUV) proposed here, we capture timing errors caused by circuit-level variability as high-level software knowledge. WUV consists of descriptive metadata to characterize the impact of variability on different work-unit types running on various cores. As such, WUV provides a useful abstraction of hardware variability to efficiently allocate a given work-unit to a suitable core for execution. VOMP enables hardware/software collaboration with online variability monitors in hardware and runtime scheduling in software. The hardware provides online per-core characterization of WUV metadata. This metadata is made available by carefully placing key data structures in a shared L1 memory and is used by VOMP schedulerss. Our results show that VOMP greatly reduces the cost of timing error recovery compared to the baseline schedulers of OpenMP, yielding speedup of 3%-36% for tasks, and 26%-49% for sections. Further, VOMP reaches energy saving of 2%-46% and 15%-50% for tasks, and sections, respectively.",

        "Abstract": "In this era of smart devices, new technologies, gadgets, apps, and numerous systems and services available over online, teaching an introductory programming course by traditional lecture method faces challenges to draw student's attention; especially in their freshman year. In this work, we discuss our experience in teaching an introductory CS course by infusing both interactive and collaborative learning in pedagogy so that students can learn using interactive platforms, tools, technologies, systems, and services as available to them and collaboration within and among groups. For interactive learning, students used an interactive programming environment (e.g. repl. it classroom) as well as online eBooks. We designed several in-class exercises, assignments, small lab-based projects with example codes and expected outputs, and unit tests by using built-in unit tests library. We also, in the middle of semester, introduced collaborative learning through teamwork on well-defined projects during the learning time and submitted at the end. The collaborations include use of basic task management tools and multi-player tool of repl.it that the students can critic, supplement, improve peer works and learn. To evaluate the impact of this infusion, a pre- and post-survey were conducted on student cohort in two different semesters. The initial evaluation of the survey results and performances (final project and final grades) show evidence to conclude that the proposed pedagogical approach increased student motivation and engagement and facilitated learning to entry-level computer science students.",

        "Abstract": "A lightweight Java application suite has been developed and deployed allowing collaborative learning between students and tutors at remote locations. Students can engage in group activities online and also collaborate with tutors. A generic Java framework has been developed and applied to electronics, computing and mathematics education. The applications are respectively: (a) a digital circuit simulator, which allows students to collaborate in building simple or complex electronic circuits; (b) a Java programming environment where the paradigm is behavioural-based robotics, and (c) a differential equation solver useful in modelling of any complex and nonlinear dynamic system. Each student sees a common shared window on which may be added text or graphical objects and which can then be shared online. A built-in chat room supports collaborative dialogue. Students can work either in collaborative groups or else in teams as directed by the tutor. This paper summarises the technical architecture of the system as well as the pedagogical implications of the suite. A report of student evaluation is also presented distilled from use over a period of twelve months. We intend this suite to facilitate learning between groups at one or many institutions and to facilitate international collaboration. We also intend to use the suite as a tool to research the establishment and behaviour of collaborative learning groups. We shall make our software freely available to interested researchers",

        "Abstract": "There is growing interest in using intelligent software agents for a variety of tasks, including navigating and retrieving information from the Internet and from databases, online shopping activities, user authentication, negotiation for resources, and decision making. We propose an integrated framework for information retrieval and information filtering in the context of Internet shopping. We focus on applying agent technology, together with Web mining technology, to automate a series of product search and selection activities. It is based on a multiagent development platform, namely, iJADE (intelligent Java agent development environment), which supports various e-commerce applications. The framework comprises an automatic facial authentication utility and six other modules, namely, customer requirements definition, a requirement-fuzzification scheme, a fuzzy agents-negotiation scheme, a fuzzy product-selection scheme, a product-defuzzification scheme, and a product-evaluation scheme. A series of experiments were carried out and favorable results were produced in executing the framework. From an experimental point of view, we used a database of 1,020 facial images that were obtained under various conditions of facial expression, viewing perspective and size. An overall correct recognition rate of over 85 percent was attained. For the product selection test of our fuzzy shopper system, an average matching rate of more than 81 percent was achieved.",

        "Abstract": "Source code search tools are designed to help developers locate code relevant to their task. The effectiveness of a search technique often depends on properties of user queries, the code being searched, and the specific task at hand. Thus, new code search techniques should ideally be evaluated in realistic situations that closely reflect the complexity, purpose of use, and context encountered during actual search sessions. This paper explores what can be learned from using an online paired interleaving approach, originally used for evaluating internet search engines, to comparatively observe and assess the effectiveness of code search tools in the field. We present a case study in which we implemented online paired interleaving for code search, deployed the tool in an IDE for developers at multiple companies, and analyzed results from over 300 user queries during their daily software maintenance tasks. We leveraged the results to direct further improvement of a search technique, redeployed the tool and analyzed results from over 600 queries to validate that an improvement in search was achieved in the field. We also report on the characteristics of user queries collected during the study, which are significantly different than queries currently used in evaluations.",

        "Abstract": "Cloud computing technologies play an increasingly important role in realizing data-intensive applications by offering a virtualized compute and storage infrastructure that can scale on demand. A programming model that has gained a lot of interest in this context is MapReduce, which simplifies processing of large-scale distributed data volumes, usually on top of a distributed file system layer. In this paper we report on a self-configuring adaptive framework for developing and optimizing data-intensive scientific applications on top of Cloud and Grid computing technologies and the Hadoop framework. Our framework relies on a MAPE-K loop, known from autonomic computing, for optimizing the configuration of data-intensive applications at three abstraction layers: the application layer, the MapReduce layer, and the resource layer. By evaluating monitored resources, the framework configures the layers and allocates the resources on a per job basis. The evaluation of configurations relies on historic data and a utility function that ranks different configurations regarding to the arising costs. The optimization framework has been integrated in the Vienna Grid Environment (VGE), a service-oriented application development environment for providing applications on HPC systems, clusters and Clouds as services. An experimental evaluation of our framework has been undertaken with a data-analysis application from the field of molecular systems biology.",

        "Abstract": "Application developers require cloud solutions that offer a highly scalable and secure development environment. Some Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solutions fail to meet the security requirements of developers, administrators, and final users in a satisfactory and flexible manner. While some providers do offer secure cloud solutions, users are obliged to redesign and adapt their applications in order to conform to the provided environment. The present work introduces MagosCloud Secure, a highly-scalable, opportunistic, declarative, and secure solution constructed on the basis of MagosCloud[1], designed to meet the needs of traditional and e-science application developers. It allows the deployment of a variety of platforms, providing an access control model whereby developers may declaratively state how they wish their data and application resources to be automatically shared with other users. It relies on the concept of `separation of concerns', such that developers need only be concerned with creating their applications, entrusting MagosCloud Secure with the responsibility of providing a secure, highly scalable platform. Finally, the results of tests concerning the automatic generation of secure platforms, as well as run time considerations, are analyzed.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we report on our use of cloud-robotics solutions to teach a Robotics Applications Programming course at Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW). The usage of Kubernetes based cloud computing environment combined with real robots - turtlebots and Niryo arms - allowed us to: 1) minimize the set up times required to provide a Robotic Operating System (ROS) simulation and development environment to all students independently of their laptop architecture and OS; 2) provide a seamless “simulation to real” experience preserving the exciting experience of writing software interacting with the physical world; and 3) sharing GPUs across multiple student groups, thus using resources efficiently. We describe our requirements, solution design, experience working with the solution in the educational context and areas where it can be further improved. This may be of interest to other educators who may want to replicate our experience.",

        "Abstract": "MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) games are currently one of the most popular online video game genres. This paper discusses implementation of a typical MOBA game prototype for Windows platform in a popular game engine Unity 5. The focus is put on using the built-in Unity components in a MOBA setting, developing additional behaviours using Unity's Scripting API for C# and integrating third party components such as the networking engine, 3D models, and particle systems created for use with Unity and available through the Unity Asset Store. A brief overview of useful programming design patterns as well as design patterns already used in Unity is given. Various game state synchronization mechanisms available in the chosen networking engine, Photon Unity Networking, and their usage when synchronizing different types of game information over multiple clients are also discussed. The implemented game retains most of the main features of the modern MOBA games such as heroes with different play styles, skills, team versus team competition, resource collection and consumption, varied maps and defensive structures. The paper concludes with comments on Unity 5 as a MOBA game development environment and execution engine.",

        "Abstract": "The creation of cyber physical systems requires not only the effective education of future engineers in the classroom, but also ongoing training to support life-long learning by practicing engineers, who will continuously face new technologies and challenges. But what topics exactly should this training cover? To answer this question, an analysis was conducted of an online forum used by programmers who create cyber physical systems with the Lab VIEW development environment. This examination of over 150,000 forum message threads has highlighted crucial gaps in the training of practicing engineers, especially in the areas of hardware-software integration, as well as the design and implementation of user interfaces and algorithms. A complementary review of the available online training materials relevant to these topics reveals the need for more systematic support for learning by practicing system engineers. These results provide empirical support for ongoing efforts to provide more effective education of current and future engineers of cyber physical systems, including through reuse of third-party code and other resources to support learning.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents a versatile heterogeneous sensor network simulator library that incorporates an online power model for real-time resource management research projects. The library integrates a well-known multi-agent simulator library Swarm, a popular sensor operating system, TinyOS, and a sensor network simulator tool called TOSSIM. The motivation of designing our library is to address difficulties in studying large-scale wireless sensor networks with energy constraints. The library supports the non-linear energy model used in PowerTOSSIMz, but unlike PowerTOSSIMz, which only supports an offline post-processing battery simulation, our library provides an online energy model. Furthermore, the integration with Swarm enables rich features of the Swarm libraries such as run-time probes, pre-defined simulation environments, data collection and analysis tools, powerful random number generators, and graphical user interfaces. We also enhanced TOSSIM so that heterogeneous TinyOS applications can be executed on simulated sensor nodes. Furthermore, the same source codes that run on the simulator can be deployed on actual hardware sensor nodes supporting an easier hardware/software co-design. The resulting simulator library, SWARM-eTOSSIM, provides versatile visualization tools for diagnostic analysis and a development environment for heterogeneous applications with consideration of real-time energy constraints.",

In view of the problems in teaching “Database Principles” in the MOOC development environment, such as the disjointed reality between the teaching philosophy and theory and practice, how to carry out technical teaching and interactive practice in the MOOC environment, etc. The methods of the database course are proposed in this article, which take the “problem-solving-inductive analysis” solution-driven approach as the main line, from teaching content design, teaching methods, flipped classroom model design under the MOOC environment. These methods also conduct research and design about “Learning Flow” and the database remote experiment and large-scale operation practice. Therefore, these methods have systematically improved the capabilities of deeply learning database knowledge and problem solving such as theme-oriented, in-depth discussion, online interaction, etc.",

        "Abstract": "Maintaining competitiveness and mitigating health issues test caused by unergonomic working conditions are two main reasons for automating production processes. But such automation is expensive, also because test experts are required to program the robots. One approach to lowering these costs is to enable shop-floor workers to program robots by providing task-level programming tools. Task-level programming is an established approach, yet appropriate workflows for experts and shop-floor workers remain to be defined. The objective of this letter is to evaluate RAZER, a framework for robot task-level programming, in which skill programming and parameter interface definitions are integrated. The framework provides workflows for both experts-creating skills and providing their parameter interfaces-and for shop-floor workers-using these skills to create executable robot tasks in an intuitive human-robot interface (HRI). The HRI is a graphical user interface that runs in a browser, and provides access to other man-machine interface, such as programming by demonstration. Two pilot and two user studies proof that RAZER fulfills the demands of both experts and novice users.",

        "Abstract": "It is difficult and challenging to comprehend the internal aspects of a program. The internal aspects are seen as contrasts to end user aspects and interface aspects. Internal program documentation is relevant for almost any kind of software. The internal program documentation represents the original as well as the accumulated understanding of the program, which is very difficult to extract from the source program and its modifications over time. Elucidative programming is a documentation technique that was originally inspired by literate programming. As an important difference between the two, elucidative programming does not call for any reorganization of the source programs, as required by literate programming tools. Elucidative programming provides for mutual navigation in between program source files and sections of the documentation. The navigation takes place in an Internet browser applying a two-framed layout. In this paper we investigate the applicability of elucidative programming in a number of areas related to internal program documentation. It is concluded that elucidative programming can solve a number of concrete problems in the areas of program tutorials, frameworks, and program reviews. In addition we see positive impacts of elucidative programming in the area of programming education.",

This technique has demonstrated to produce higher quality code in less time it would take an individual programmer. We present the COPPER system, a synchronous source code editor that allows two distributed software engineers to write a program using pair programming. COPPER implements characteristics of groupware systems such as communication mechanism, collaboration awareness, concurrency control, and a radar view of the documents, among others. It also incorporates a document presence module, which extends the functionality of instant messaging systems to allow users to register documents from a Web server and interact with them in a similar fashion as they do with a colleague. We report results from a preliminary evaluation of COPPER which provide evidence that the system could successfully support distributed pair programming.",

Programmers should know the syntax of the programming language in order to code. The aim of the proposed model is to do away with the syntactic structure of a programming language and the user can specify the instructions in human interactive form, using either text or speech. The designed solution is an application based on speech recognition and user interaction to make coding faster and efficient. Lexical, syntax and semantic analysis is performed on the user's instructions and then the code is generated. C is used as the programming language in the proposed model. The code editor is a web page and the user instructions are sent to a Flask server for processing. Using Python libraries NLTK and ply libraries, conversion of human language data to programmable C codes is done and the code is returned to the client. Lex is used for tokenization and the LALR parser of Yacc processes the syntax specifications to generate an output procedure. The results are recorded and analyzed for time taken to convert the NL commands to code and the efficiency of the implementation is measured with accuracy, precision and recall.",

        "Abstract": "Global cognizance for a green environment will embark on the rising demand for Plugin Electric vehicles (PEV) in the upcoming years. In this article, an online power management scheme (RTPMS) for a solar power battery-buffer grid-connected charging facility in an educational work area is developed. This algorithm contributes to lessening the overall diurnal price of recharging the PEVs, alleviating the influence of the charging station on the power grid, while participating in shaving the rise of the load curve. The understudy paper sheds the idea of quick charging of PEV integrated with energy storage stacks, photovoltaic systems and at the least demand with the power grid subject to constraints scenarios. Forecasting and statistical parameters are considered in the RTPMS to model the many uncertainties encompasses such as the photovoltaic power, PEVs arrival-departure period, and the energy present in their car batteries during their entrance at the station. The paper demonstrate maximum profit acquired by fast electric station besides lessening the overloading on the power grid with the execution of resilient RTPMS. The efficacy of the proposed supervisory rule-based method is stamped through assigning different assignments through MATLAB code editor.",

        "Abstract": "There are four fundamental aspects of use and reuse in building systems from components: conceptualization, retrieval, selection and correct use. The most important barrier to use and reuse is that of conceptualization. The Inscape environment is a specification-based software development environment integrated by the constructive use of formal interface specifications. The purpose of the formal interface specifications and the semantic interconnections is to make explicit the invisible semantic dependencies that result in conventionally-built systems. The important ingredient provided by Inquire in conceptualization, retrieval, selection and use is the set of predicates that describe the semantics of the elements in the interface. These predicates define the abstractions that are germane to the module interface and describe the properties of data objects and the assumptions and results of operations in a module. Use and reuse of components is based on a component's ability to provide needed semantics at a particular point in a system. It is the purpose of Inquire, the browser and predicate-based search mechanism, to aid both the environment and the user in the search for the components that will provide the desired predicates that are required to build and evolve an implementation correctly.<>",

        "Abstract": "Aspiring software developers, like the novice students in Computer Science courses, need to acquire a thorough understanding of fundamental computational concepts like sequential execution, conditional branching, loops, modularisation, hierarchy and reuse. This understanding and \"computational thinking\" is deepened when they encounter the concepts in different contexts and environments, as opposed to only in one traditional programming language. In this paper, we describe how we used the Cinco Adventure Game Tool, a tool that allows students to model simple browser games in an intuitive graphical framework, to train basic computational concepts in a creative and engaging, learning-by-doing fashion. On purpose, we steered away from traditional programming languages, in order to separate the use of the concepts and constructs from the hurdle of a programming language syntax and development environment. The experiences with a large group of first-term Computer Science students in two successive years were very positive: The students had no problems in understanding and using the concepts, used the tool proficiently and enjoyed designing and modelling the games. Working together on a game project in small groups, they showed sustained engagement, developed a high level of confidence, and created quite complex games containing various fundamental computational constructs.",

        "Abstract": "Even though there exists a number of search solutions targetted at software engineers the literature suggests that they are not widely used by the people engaged in code delivery [26]. Moreover, current code focused information retrieval systems such as Google Code Search (discontinued), Codeplex or Koders produce results based on specific keywords and therefore they do not take into account user context such as location, browsing history, previous interaction patterns and domain expertise. In this paper we discuss the development of task-specific information retrieval systems for software engineers. We discuss how software engineers interact with information and information retrieval systems and investigate to what extent a domain-specific search and recommendation system can be developed in order to support their work related activities. We have conducted a user study: a questionnaire and an automated observation of user interactions with the browser and software development environment. We discuss factors that can be used as implicit feedback indicators for further collaborative filtering and discuss how these parameters can be analysed using Computational Intelligence based techniques.",

The system is designed for monitoring, supervision, and remotely controlling motors and sensors deployed for oil and gas facilities. The Internet of Things (IoT) based SCADA system consists of a host computer on which a server is deployed using the Node-RED programming tool and two terminal units connected to it: Arduino Uno and Arduino Mega. The Arduino Uno collects and communicates the data acquired from the temperature, flowrate, and water level sensors to the Node-Red on the computer through the serial port. It also uses a local liquid crystal display (LCD) to display the temperature. Node-RED on the computer retrieves the data from the voltage, current, rotary, accelerometer, and distance sensors through the Arduino Mega. Also, a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) is created using Node-RED and hosted on the local server for parsing the collected data. Finally, an HTTP basic access authentication is implemented using Nginx to control the clients' access from the Internet to the local server and to enhance its security and reliability.",

        "Abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) is a promising new medium for immersive storytelling. While previous research works on VR narrative have tried to engage audiences through nice scenes and interactivity, the emerging live streaming shows the role of a presenter, especially the conveyance of emotion, for promoting audience involvement and enjoyment. In this paper, to lower the requirement of emotion embodiment, we borrow experience from cartoon animation and comics, and propose a novel cartoon-style hybrid emotion embodiment model to increase a storyteller's presence during live performance, which contains an avatar with six basic emotions and auxiliary multimodal display to enhance emotion expressing. We further design and implement a system to teleoperate the embodiment model in VR for live storytelling. In particular, 1) we design a novel visual programming tool that allows users to customize emotional effects based on the emotion embodiment model; 2) we design a novel face tracking module to map presenters' emotional states to the avatar in VR. Our lightweight web-based implementation also makes the application very easy to use. We conduct two preliminary qualitative studies to explore the potential of the hybrid model and the storytelling system, including interviews with three experts and a workshop study with local secondary school students. Results show the potential of the VR storytelling system for education.",

Due to the intrinsic nature of the IoT: heterogeneous devices/resources, a tightly coupled perception-action cycle and widely distributed devices and processing, application development in the Fog can be challenging. To address these challenges, we propose a Distributed Dataflow (DDF) programming model for the IoT that utilises computing infrastructures across the Fog and the Cloud. We evaluate our proposal by implementing a DDF framework based on Node-RED (Distributed Node-RED or D-NR), a visual programming tool that uses a flow-based model for building IoT applications. Via demonstrations, we show that our approach eases the development process and can be used to build a variety of IoT applications that work efficiently in the Fog.",

However, interconnection of the Smart city systems still is a challenging process due to incompatibility of systems that apply a plenty of appropriate technical solutions and protocols that cause collaboration between automation devices such as sensors, actuators, controllers. Introduction of Internet-of-Things (IoT) provides promising opportunities to develop new services and integrate different application domains. The Arrowhead Framework aims to apply Service Oriented Architecture to the embedded systems' world. This research is focused on the one of the Arrowhead Framework core systems - Event Handler. This system supports the handling of events, and enriches service-oriented applications with the capabilities of interacting via the publish/subscribe paradigm. We implemented the Event Handler system as a MQTT enabled service broker, and deployed data flow programming tool Node-RED for wiring together divergent hardware devices and nodes, and APIs for online services. A case study of the service broker implemented for control of utilities systems in urban environment is presented and discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Monitoring and control of utilities networks is a challenging process due to plenty of human work, incompatibility of systems that apply a plenty of appropriate technical solutions and protocols. Thus collaboration between automation devices such as sensors, actuators, controllers, and others transformed into IoT-type of devices and systems becomes important. This research is focused on the Arrowhead Framework core systems, namely Event handler and Historian systems, its implication and role in the framework. The Event Handler system supports the handling of events, and enriches service-oriented applications with the capabilities of interacting via the publish/subscribe paradigm. We implemented the Event Handler system as a MQTT enabled service broker, and deployed Data flow programming tool Node-RED for wiring together divergent hardware devices and nodes, and APIs for online services. For implementation of the Historian System Mongo and MySQL data bases were used.",

        "Abstract": "In principle, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) addresses central aspects of robotics software development. Domain experts could leverage the expressiveness of models; implementation details over different hardware could be handled by automatic code generation. In practice, most evidence points to manual code development as the norm, despite several MDE efforts in robotics. Possible reasons for this disconnect are the wide ranges of applications and target platforms making all-encompassing MDE IDEs hard to develop and maintain, with developers reverting to writing code manually. Acknowledging this, and given the opportunity to leverage a large corpus of open-source software widely adopted by the robotics community, we pursue modeling as a complement, rather than an alternative, to manually written code. Our previous work introduced metamodels to describe components, their interactions, and their resulting composition, as inspired by, but not limited to, the de-facto standard Robot Operating System (ROS). In this paper we put such metamodels into use through two contributions. First, we automate the generation of models from manually written artifacts through extraction from source code and runtime system monitoring. Second, we make available an easy-to-use web infrastructure to perform the extraction, together with a growing database of models so generated. Our aim with this tooling, publicly available both as-a-service and as source code, is to lower the MDE barrier for practitioners and leverage models to 1) improve the understanding of manually written code; 2) perform correctness checks; and 3) systematize the definition and adoption of best practices through large-scale generation of models from existing code. A comprehensive example is provided as a walk-through for robotics software practitioners.",

        "Abstract": "We present Socialite, a novel end user programming tool for the Social Internet of Things (SIoT). SIoT is a new paradigm where IoT merges with social networks, allowing people and connected devices as well as the devices themselves to interact within a social network framework. Through an online survey with 60 potential users, we identified eight desired features for the SIoT, which were then clustered into four rule categories that can be programmed by end users and/or imposed by systems. The rules created by end users are used to reason about both devices and people in their social relationships to support automated decisions during runtime. Socialite uses ontology/semantic models for basic/low-level knowledge representation (e.g., device and user) to encapsulate the heterogeneity in devices from various manufacturers, and uses production rules (trigger-action programming) for high-level reasoning. With the ontology model, our reasoning supports both device type automation (e.g., current temperature from a thermostat) and capability-based automation (e.g., current temperature from any devices with the same capability). Furthermore, the Socialite rules leverage social relationships and device capabilities to facilitate collaboration by efficiently sharing configuration and information among users/friends and even with devices from people unknown to a user. In a 24-participant user study (12 with no programming experience), we found that Socialite was easy to learn and use, for both programmers and non-programmers. Participants were able to create automation based rules, social relationship involved rules, as well rules they created during the study.",

The sensing element was fabricated by modifying screen-printed interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) with a hybrid nanocomposite of Multi-Wall Carbon Nanotube (MWCNT) with Zinc Oxide (ZnO) nanocrystals. The NH4+ of the water was monitored, and it exhibited a sensitivity of  $67.13 \\,\\,\\Omega $ /mM with average correlation coefficients of 0.80. The impedance magnitude ( $\\Omega$ ) of the NH4+ sensor was unaffected by the presence of Fe2+, Ni2+, K+ and P+ interfering cations. The developed sensor was interfaced with an IoT-enabled NodeMCU microcontroller, enabling a direct method for continuous monitoring of NH4+ concentrations. This integrated system is interconnected to the field-deployed sensor nodes, which provide real-time NH4+ levels to the remote user through web applications.",

        "Abstract": "Recently many researches have explored the potential of visual programming in robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and education. However, there is a lack of studies that analyze the recent evidence-based visual programming approaches that are applied in several domains. This study presents a systematic review to understand, compare, and reflect on recent visual programming approaches using twelve dimensions: visual programming classification, interaction style, target users, domain, platform, empirical evaluation type, test participants' type, number of test participants, test participants' programming skills, evaluation methods, evaluation measures, and accessibility of visual programming tools. The results show that most of the selected articles discussed tools that target IoT and education, while other fields such as data science, robotics are emerging. Further, most tools use abstractions to hide implementation details and use similar interaction styles. The predominant platforms for the tools are web and mobile, while desktop-based tools are on the decline. Only a few tools were evaluated with a formal experiment, whilst the remaining ones were evaluated with evaluation studies or informal feedback. Most tools were evaluated with students with little to no programming skills. There is a lack of emphasis on usability principles in the design stage of the tools. Additionally, only one of the tools was evaluated for expressiveness. Other areas for exploration include supporting end users throughout the life cycle of applications created with the tools, studying the impact of tutorials on improving learnability, and exploring the potential of machine learning to improve debugging solutions developed with visual programming.",

        "Abstract": "MAS (Multi Agent Systems), belong to the field of AI (Artificial Intelligence), the study addressing the methods of construction of complex systems using a large number of agents and adjusting their behavior to a particular problem. MAS can be defined as groups of entities (agents) working together to solve problems not solvable by their individual skills and know-how. Business decisions are based on extraction of useful knowledge from different data sources. Those data sources, usually called the big data, might be huge digital data sets such as an internal data warehouse or external sources like the web. In order to process the big data, one needs to have smart solutions, analytics services, programming tools and applications. Intelligent agents can perform certain tasks such as big data processing, information retrieval and the creation of OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) cubes which represent multidimensional data. Given that volumes of data grow continuously, insurance companies have to be able manage them. The agent technology has the potential to become the key technology for management of ever-increasing amount of information. This paper describes how to develop MAS in order to gather useful knowledge from the data source and automate the specific process for better business decision.",

Reconceptualizing-programming environments as layered behaviour processors in the context of creating SimCity/sup TM/ like interactive simulations-makes end user programming more feasible. The layered approach serves the programming needs for a range of users, including casual computer end users and professional programmers. The extension of the Agentsheets system with the Ristretto/sup TM/ agent to Java bytecode compiler is used to illustrate how a behaviour processor enables end users to create their own Java applets that can be embedded into Web pages.",

However, there is a clear lack of approaches with specific methodologies or optimal working environments to develop high-performance computing software systems. Additionally, existing frameworks are focused on the design and implementation phases, forgetting software component reuse from the earliest stages of the development process. An aspect-oriented and component-based approach is proposed for the development of complex parallel applications from existing functional components and new component definitions, according to business rules established by the users, through a web service entry of the platform. The proposed approach includes a specific methodology to develop high-performance scientific applications through the reuse of components from the earliest stages. Finally, an additional supercomputing-oriented framework aims to facilitate the development of these systems and to make creation, cataloguing, validation and reuse of each application and its components easier.",

        "Abstract": "The huge demand for situational and ad-hoc applications desired by the mass of business end users cannot be fully implemented by IT departments. New approaches that allow for end user development (EUD) are needed to overcome this ldquolong-tailrdquo dilemma. More specifically, most existing approaches insufficiently support EUD for infrequent, situational, and ad-hoc B2B collaborations. Enterprise mashup and lightweight composition approaches and tools are promising solutions to unleash the huge potential of integrating the mass of users into development. Within the current research project FAST, a Web based mashup/Gadget development tool is in development that allows for different options to realize B2B collaborations via mashups. In this work, five patterns for the development of enterprise mashups are identified, characterized, and evaluated with focus on their adequacy for B2B collaborations.",

        "Abstract": "The needs for cheaper and less intrusive ways to collect activity-travel diaries led scientist to pursue new technologies, e.g., positioning technologies like GPS. While a fully, reliable and widely accepted automatic activity-travel diary collection system is yet to be developed, scientists have presented systems that automate parts of an activity-travel diary collection. In the advent of automated systems, it is important to discuss how to analyse the potential of such systems and how to compare different activity-travel diary collection systems. To achieve this objective, this paper introduces a parallel survey design and a comparison framework for collection systems. The framework can be used as a development tool to optimise system design, to report and monitor progress of different system designs, to objectively weigh benefits in decision making, and to automate systematic analysis. In particular, the framework can be used as a comparison tool to reveal the qualitative difference in the data gathered using different collection systems. To achieve this, the framework defines: 1) a number of activity-travel diary measurement entities (trips and triplegs), entity attributes (e.g., trip purpose, origin / destination, etc.), 2) similarity functions between instances of the same entities, and 3) spatial and temporal quality indices to establish a notion of ground truth. The utility of the proposed framework is demonstrated by analysing the results of a trial survey where data is collected via two activity-travel collection systems: a web-based system (PP) and a smartphone-app-based system (MEILI). PP was collected for one day period and MEILI was used for one week period (with one day overlapping). The results show that half of the trips are captured by both systems, while each system roughly captures the same number of trips as the other. The strengths and weaknesses of MEILI are analysed using the framework on the entire week dataset.",

Together with the component object model and a layering framework, the agent architecture can be used to build Internet applications that support individualized services. The DIWB can construct pages dynamically at runtime and can be easily customized for individual users. The architecture consists of two cooperating agents that compose pages at runtime using components and data stored in various databases (agencies). The page agent composes a page by retrieving page definition and requesting the component agent to construct individual components. The component agent retrieves user preferences, and page component definitions from the databases and returns the results to the page agent.",

The first part of this paper is focused on some technical description of the Big Research Polygon and the Small Research Polygon (e. g. borehole equipment, temperature conditions, data acquisition systems etc.). The second part briefly describes how the data are processed and analyzed via user-developed applications based on IDEs of Microsys Promotic and NI LabVIEW, whereas each of these applications can offer some specific way how to process online or offline data from SRP boreholes only. A purpose of the applications is to help user visualize and analyze data efficiently. The third part, the most important one, is centered on mathematical modeling, which can be used for practical design of borehole polygons. There is some borehole dimensioning approach based on Fourier differential equation and other equations, knowledge, and parameters useful for computational algorithms of sophisticated modelling software applications such as EED, SVHeat, and PetraSim (their features are mentioned), whereas only EED borehole design process and its results are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Programming courses are needed for an increasing number of students in the Higher Education Institutions of today. Of all the programming languages covered in typical courses, the C and Assembly languages are among the most critical. As they are very low level languages, their knowledge helps the students to understand the inner workings of a computer. At the same time, their differences from other programming languages, demands from the learner a serious adjustment of the mental model. As the programming tools and environments are also different, there is the need of supporting the students in their learning, using a minimum of infrastructure, due to financial restrictions, and to support the maximum number of students, with the existing resources. The use of a Virtual Machine based on a Live Linux distribution, together with an enhanced set of software tests can provide students with an easy to install development platform, providing a good amount feedback, with very limited network usage. The methods described in this paper have been applied with good results, and can be used to support live or online classes.",

        "Abstract": "The business process modelling notation (BPMN) is a graph-oriented language in which control and action nodes can be connected almost arbitrarily. It is supported by various modelling tools but so far no systems can directly execute BPMN models. The business process execution language for Web services (BPEL) on the other hand is a mainly block-structured language supported by several execution platforms. In the current setting, mapping BPMN models to BPEL code is a necessary step towards unified and standards-based business process development environments. It turns out that this mapping is challenging from a scientific viewpoint as BPMN and BPEL represent two fundamentally different classes of languages. Existing methods for mapping BPMN to BPEL impose limitations on the structure of the source model. This paper proposes a technique that overcomes these limitations. Beyond its direct relevance in the context of BPMN and BPEL, this technique addresses difficult problems that arise generally when translating between flow-based languages with parallelism",

        "Abstract": "A new generation of development environments takes a radical approach to communication and coordination by fusing social networking functionality with flexible, distributed version control. Through these transparent work environments, people, repositories, development activities, and their histories are immediately and easily visible to all users. Developers quickly acquire the skill to interpret this rich information to find useful resources, connect with people, solve technical problems, and enhance their learning opportunities. This article presents the results of a qualitative study of users of one such environment, GitHub. It describes how transparency helps developers on GitHub manage their projects, handle dependencies more effectively, reduce communication needs, and figure out what requires their attention. Although transparency is not a silver bullet, the approach shows great promise for enhancing collaboration and coordination.

        "Abstract": "Mashup Programming is one of the latest trends in web application development. However, different sources still regard that mashup technology is in its infancy despite the mushroom growth of mashup-based applications and technologies. This calls for an in depth analysis of the support available to end users for mashup development. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional framework to evaluate existing mashup tools and platforms. The main idea behind this evaluation is to study the state of the art of mashup development from the end-user perspective and critically evaluate the efforts in this regard against a set of criteria to identify the research directions in this field. The idea of evaluation of mashup tools has been tackled through different approaches in past, however, in this research we attempt to synthesize additional concepts regarding mashup development and analyse this area against previously ignored factors, such as support for capturing users' requirements and users' goals. This study also includes platforms that have not yet been covered by previous evaluation studies. The framework presented in this study can be used as a guideline to inform future design of mashup development environments for both academic and industrial research. The results of the study reinforce the need of a more user-oriented approach to deal with the inherent issues of end-user mashup programming. The study concludes with the proposal of use of goals as a guiding mechanism to derive the mashup applications.",

        "Abstract": "The idea of developing software systems by putting software modules together has been a goal for many software researchers and practitioners for a long time. This goal is within sight due to the increased adoption of component-based software engineering, the development of component standards, and their wide acceptance by industry. Component-based development is an approach to developing a software system by assembling and composing already built software components. It promises reusable and plug-and-playable software system development environments. The component concept is not new and has been perceived in several different ways by software researchers in academics and practitioners in industry. The different perspectives from diverse researchers and practitioners have led to a plethora of definitions of component and different component specification and implementation models. In this paper, we briefly review several of these different views and definitions on software components. We then present the Interoperable Component Specification Model (ICSM) for the Web services environment.",

        "Abstract": "Autocompletion systems support users in the formulation of queries in different computer systems, from development environments to the web. In this paper we describe Composite Match Autocompletion (COMMA), a lightweight approach to the introduction of semantics in the realization of a semi-structured data auto completion matching algorithm. The approach is formally described, then it is applied and evaluated with specific reference to the e-commerce context. The semantic extension to the matching algorithm exploits available information about product categories and distinguishing features of products to enhance the elaboration of exploratory queries. COMMA supports a seamless management of both targeted/precise queries and exploratory/vague ones, combining different filtering and scoring techniques. The algorithm is evaluated with respect both to effectiveness and efficiency in a real-world scenario: the achieved improvement is significant and not associated to a sensible increase of computational costs.",

        "Abstract": "Most of the development environments for high performance parallel applications require that all the computing modules and resources be known in advance. The execution environment must know where the different program modules will be executed, and must properly configure each computer involved in the execution. We describe how the Web Operating System (WOS/sup TM/) environment may be used to dynamically adjust the granularity of parallel programs, locate available computers to perform the computations and how these computers are dynamically configured. The WOS (P. Kropf et al., 2000) is a metacomputing environment suitable for supporting and managing distributed parallel processing on wide and local networks. Communication between WOS nodes is realized through a generic service protocol (WOSP) and a discovery/location protocol (WOSRP). WOSP may be versioned to support specialized services. The authors focus on the design of two such versions for parallel/distributed applications and high performance computing. These versions support the location and setup of computational nodes for these applications.",

        "Abstract": "While specifying an IoT-based system, software developers have to face a set of challenges, spanning from selecting the hardware components to writing the actual source code. Even though dedicated development environments are in place, a non-expert user might struggle with the over-choice problem in selecting the proper component. By combining MDE and recommender systems, this paper proposes an initial prototype, called ResyDuo, to assist Arduino developers by providing two different artifacts, i.e., hardware components and software libraries. In particular, we make use of a widely adopted collaborative filtering algorithm by collecting relevant information by means of a dedicated data model. ResyDuo can retrieve hardware components by using tags or existing Arduino projects stored on the ProjectHub repository. Then, the system can eventually retrieve corresponding software libraries based on the identified hardware devices. ResyDuo is equipped with a web-based interface that allows users to easily select and configure the under-developing Arduino project. To assess ResyDuo's performances, we run the ten-fold cross-validation by adopting the grid search strategy to optimize the hyperparameters of the CF-based algorithm. The conducted evaluation shows encouraging results even though there is still room for improvement in terms of the examined metrics.",

However, tightly controlled online commercial game pose challenges to researchers interested in observing player activities, constructing player strategy models, and developing practical AI technology in them. Instead of setting up new programming environments or building a large amount of agentpsilas decision rules by playerpsilas experience for conducting real-time AI research, the authors use replays of the commercial RTS game StarCraft to evaluate human player behaviors and to construct an intelligent system to learn human-like decisions and behaviors. A case-based reasoning approach was applied for the purpose of training our system to learn and predict player strategies. Our analysis indicates that the proposed system is capable of learning and predicting individual player strategies, and that players provide evidence of their personal characteristics through their building construction order.",

        "Abstract": "Modern multi-core architectures offer Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) that can dynamically adjust the operating frequency of each core for energy saving. However, current parallel programming environments and schedulers for task-based programs do not utilize DVFS and thus suffer from energy inefficiency in multi-core processors. To reduce energy consumption while keeping high performance, this paper proposes an Energy-Efficient Workload-Aware (EEWA) task scheduler that is comprised of a workload-aware frequency adjuster and a preference-based task-stealing scheduler. Using DVFS, the workload-aware frequency adjuster can properly tune the frequencies of the cores according to the workload information of the tasks collected with online profiling. The preference-based task-stealing scheduler can then effectively balance the workloads among cores by stealing tasks according to a preference list. Experimental results show that EEWA can reduce energy consumption of task-based programs up to 29.8% with a slight performance degradation compared with existing task schedulers.",

To facilitate learning and reuse of code, most end-user programming environments provides online repositories. While the provision of programs in repositories helps support end-user programming to an extent, finding and reusing an appropriate program variant is a challenging task. In this paper, we explore the reuse behavior of end-user programmers using Information Foraging Theory. We conducted an empirical study of eight end-user programmers, qualitatively analyzed their information-seeking behavior while reusing program variants, and report new cue types and strategies specific to end-user programmers.",

        "Abstract": "High-performance quantum circuit simulation in a classic HPC is still imperative in the NISQ era. Observing that the major obstacle of scalable state-vector quantum simulation arises from the massively fine-grained irregular data-exchange with remote nodes, in this paper we present SV-Sim to apply the PGAS-based communication models (i.e., direct peer access for intra-node CPUs/GPUs and SHMEM for inter-node CPU/GPU clusters) for efficient general-purpose quantum circuit simulation. Through an orchestrated design based on device functional pointer, SV-Sim is able to abstract various quantum gates across multiple heterogeneous backends, including IBM/Intel/AMD CPUs, NVIDIA/AMD GPUs, and Intel Xeon Phi, in a unified framework, but still asserting outstanding performance and tractable interface to higher-level quantum programming environments, such as IBM Qiskit, Microsoft Q# and Google Cirq. Circumventing the obstacle from the lack of polymorphism in GPUs and leveraging the device-initiated one-sided communication, SV-Sim can process circuit that are dynamically generated in Python using a single GPU/CPU kernel without the need of expensive JIT or runtime parsing, significantly simplifying the programming complexity and improving performance for QC simulation. This is especially appealing for the variational quantum algorithms given the circuits are synthesized online per iteration. Evaluations on the latest NVIDIA DGX-A100, V100-DGX-2, ALCF Theta, OLCF Spock, and OLCF Summit HPCs show that SV-Sim can deliver scalable performance on various state-of-the-art HPC platforms, offering a useful tool for quantum algorithm validation and verification. SV-Sim has been released at http://github.com/pnnl/sv-sim. A version specially tweaked for Q#/QDK is also provided.",

        "Abstract": "Smart environments demand novel paradigms offering easy configuration, programming and deployment of pervasive applications. To this purpose, different solutions have been proposed ranging from visual paradigms based on mashups to formal languages. However, most of the paradigms proposed in the literature require further external tools to turn application description code into an executable program before the deployment on target devices. Source code generation, runtime upgrades and recovery, and online debugging and inspection are often cumbersome in these programming environments. In this work we describe a methodology for real-time and on-line programming in smart environments that is compact and efficient enough to run on resource-constrained devices. The pillar of the proposed approach is real-time exchange of executable symbolic code in heterogeneous networks. The methodology is supported by an inference engine that is able to generate symbolic code starting from knowledge about hardware devices and their placement in the environment, and about the application domain. Interoperability with existing smart applications and Internet of Things (IoT) deployments is reached through a symbolic Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) client, and Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) client.",

Many Snap! users start programming by reusing and modifying an example project, but encounter many barriers when searching and identifying the relevant parts of the program to learn and reuse. We present Pinpoint, a system that helps Snap! programmers understand and reuse an existing program by isolating the code responsible for specific events during program execution. Specifically, a user can record an execution of the program (including user inputs and graphical output), replay the output, and select a specific time interval where the event of interest occurred, to view code that is relevant to this event. We conducted a small-scale user study to compare users’ program comprehension experience with and without Pinpoint, and found suggestive evidence that Pinpoint helps users understand and reuse a complex program more efficiently.",

        "Abstract": "Modern vehicles are getting increasingly smarter and evolving to become new mobile computing platforms. As the software platformization of vehicles advances, the demands for reconfigurable cars, installing and upgrading vehicle software as plug-and-play have also grown. However, the existing automotive software platforms are not designed for dynamic reconfiguration and plug-and-play. This paper addresses the plug-and-play challenge in the recent automotive systems. Drawing from recent advancements in the mobile phone operating systems, we propose an Android-based software architecture which supports the play-and-play in automotive systems. In our architecture, an application can be downloaded from cloud services and executed on ECUs in a distributed fashion. Before installing an application, our system performs schedulability analysis to check real-time performance requirements for recent vehicles. We also present a model-based development tool for designing a workflow of automotive applications for our system. We implement a prototype and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.",

        "Abstract": "The Mars2020 project, developed and operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), successfully landed the Perseverance rover and its flying companion Ingenuity on the surface of Mars on February 18th 2021. Perseverance com-bines heritage and cutting-edge flight software and hardware to accomplish crucial mission requirements related to Martian surface sampling. The design, development, and operation of NASA's large strate-gic science missions require the ability to communicate space-craft capabilities to hundreds of engineers across multiple dis-ciplines. The interactions between flight and ground software development, Verification and Validation (V&V), Assembly, Test, and Launch Operations (ATLO), and management each demand quick understanding of unique slices of information for each discipline. This information includes the current capabil-ities of the flight system as well as future capabilities and their status as they are developed and tested. Despite the fundamental and critical nature of this information, the flight software dictionaries used to track it are a stumbling block for many projects. These dictionaries provide the cor-nerstone for the interpretation of data sent from the spacecraft, allowing for quick comprehension by engineers on the ground. During both spacecraft development and operations, flight soft-ware dictionary management includes significant challenges due to the large number of interfacing systems and the subtle yet distinct needs of each. The engineering of flight software dictionaries for Mars2020 had numerous challenges, most-notably: parallel dictionary development to support simultaneous separate flight software build campaigns for each mission phase (cruise and surface), managing requests for operations-enabling information without perturbing the heritage interface with the rover, and the intro-duction of new tools by the dictionary stakeholders that forced the dictionary team to innovate and redesign the heritage tool chain. These challenges generated guiding principles for the dictionary development effort: emphasize coding best practices and unit testing in the dictionary code development tool chain, use institutionally provided COTS (commercial-off-the-shelf) tools whenever possible, and maintain the heritage flight-ground interface all while advancing operations-enabling information via a loosely coupled interface. Throughout development and operations, the Mars2020 dictionary toolchain included IBM DOORS Next Generation, GitHub, Microsoft Excel, Docker, Jenkins, and a significant custom-built Python codebase. Significant interfaces included JPL's command and control software, heritage flight software team tools and processes, and the many cloud-based ground tools developed for the mission. This paper will discuss the requirements for the Mars2020 dictionary development, the development team's response to those requirements, lessons learned throughout the process, steps taken towards automated deliveries and continuous integration of stakeholder inputs, potential toolchain improvements for Mars2020, and key takeaways that could be applied to future missions.",

The first is the preprocessing procedure used on the raw data prior to their presentation to the neural network. Issues reviewed include tradeoffs between preprocessing and system complexity. The second is the development of CaseNet, a neural network development tool used to graphically specify a network architecture from which executable code is generated automatically. Areas discussed include selection of the network architecture, such as choices between supervised and unsupervised learning schemes. The third concerns the interim results of the analysis of single- and four-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The relationship of the spike detection effort to a similar one for seizure detection is also outlined.<>",

We propose a curriculum and associated development tool called Phanon that teach the rudiments of programming language through exercises done online outside of class. Having students complete exercises before class frees up classroom time and instructor face time for the higher-order learning tasks of problem decomposition and solving. We report results from a pilot study that are consistent with our hypothesis that these techniques result in improved student outcomes and attitudes and we discuss a future follow-up study.",

        "Abstract": "Whenever, teams get together to work towards a common goal, conflict risk is always inherent. This applies to Agile development teams as well. Some researchers even argue it as necessary for project success. Agile development environments is no exception. The main purpose for adopting Agile is to improve the organization technology competitiveness. This is because Agile enables organizations to create software of quality standard, that allows for quicker response to the continuously changing market needs of today' world. Agile allows companies to address the market requirements while still being adaptive to constant change. Conflict-risk has been identified as one of the hindrances to realizing this purpose by the current literature, making conflict-risk a frontier towards successful Agile development project delivery. This paper explores the impact of an effectively managed conflict-risk in Agile teams, on the organization technology competitiveness. The research methodology adopted was the quantitative research approach that employed the use of purposive sampling technique. The study collected data using a survey, through an online questionnaire that gathered data from Agile professionals across SA. The findings reveal an extreme and vital role of conflict existence towards achieving agile project goals. Moreover, the findings show the impact of an effective conflict-risk mitigation and management with regards to an organization ability to maintain an effective technology competitiveness; which assist in organizations' overall success.",

        "Abstract": "As smart phones grow in popularity, manufacturers are in a race to pack an increasingly rich set of features into these tiny devices. This brings additional complexity in the system software that has to fit within the constraints of the devices (chiefly memory, stable storage, and power consumption) and hence, new bugs are revealed. How this evolution of smartphones impacts their reliability is a question that has been largely unexplored till now. With the release of open source OSes for hand-held devices, such as, Android (open sourced in October 2008) and Symbian (open sourced in February 2010), we are now in a position to explore the above question. In this paper, we analyze the reported cases of failures of Android and Symbian based on bug reports posted by third-party developers and end users and documentation of bug fixes from Android developers. First, based on 628 developer reports, our study looks into the manifestation of failures in different modules of Android and their characteristics, such as, their persistence and dependence on environment. Next, we analyze similar properties of Symbian bugs based on 153 failure reports. Our study indicates that Development Tools, Web Browsers, and Multimedia applications are most error-prone in both these systems. We further analyze 233 bug fixes for Android and categorized the different types of code modifications required for the fixes. The analysis shows that 77% of errors required minor code changes, with the largest share of these coming from modifications to attribute values and conditions. Our final analysis focuses on the relation between customizability, code complexity, and reliability in Android and Symbian. We find that despite high cyclomatic complexity, the bug densities in Android and Symbian are surprisingly low. However, the support for customizability does impact the reliability of mobile OSes and there are cautionary tales for their further development.",

The control program, as well as the development tools and graphical user interface, can all execute simultaneously on the PC due to the deterministic response of the operating system. This architecture replaces the traditional multiprocessor Host/DSP board architecture used in control applications. Advantages of a single-processor system include reduced cost and complexity, as well as increased flexibility and upgradability. Since its development, QMotor 2.0 has been used successfully in all of the control experiments, including motor and robot control, active magnetic bearing experiments, web handling, and vibration control in flexible structures.",

The aim of this migration process is to recreate IEC 61131-3 applications in IEC 61499 implementations with equivalent execution behavior. The formal model of the IEC 61131-3 standard for migration and cyclical execution model is defined. This method also creates a foundation for correct-by-design development tools and automatic migration between the IEC 61131-3 and IEC 61499 standard. Formal migration rules based on ontology mappings, restoring execution model including tasks and programs scheduling and variables mapping with different access levels, are provided. A transformation engine for importing PLC code, mapping from PLC ontology model to function block model and code generation is implemented based on the ontological knowledge base and semantic query-enhanced web rule language. The migration approach is demonstrated on a simple airport baggage handling system.",

        "Abstract": "Education is a vital part of the development of society and it is changing over time in terms of methods, content, concepts, and models. Recently, it has been increasingly prevalent to benefit from the potentialities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in addressing educational issues. In this research, the current state of the art of the integration of AI in K-12 education was provided. Specifically, different parts of education in which AI was employed along with the related AI categories were discussed according to different K-12 grades and courses. Additionally, technologies and environments that contributed to employing AI in education were discussed. To this end, a systematic literature review was conducted on articles and conference papers published between 2011 and 2021 in the Web of Science and Scopus databases. As the result of the initial search, 2075 documents were extracted and based on inclusive criteria and 210 documents were identified for further investigation. AI applications were categorized into Student performance, Teaching, Selection, and Behavior tasks, and Other. Machine Learning (ML) and Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) were the most common approaches among AI categories. Furthermore, high school-related applications were more frequent and STEM courses were substantially targeted by AI. In conclusion, the remarkable impact of AI on education was concluded. The current study reveals information about the potentialities offered by AI in K-12 education which aids researchers in implementing AI-based education systems. As for future works, other databases such as ACM library and Google Scholar can be investigated as well. Furthermore, exploring the 95 papers that were excluded due to inaccessibility to their full texts can be taken into account. Finally, the papers can be also investigated in terms of pedagogical approaches or development tools.",

The main goal of this research is to analyze their current state of maturity. In that direction, an application was developed in PhoneGap, Titanium, and Sencha, as well as native versions for Android and iOS were implemented. Such mobile application obtain information from sensors, uses camera to take pictures, applies image filters, and establishes connection to a remote Web Service. We analyzed the feasibility to build this kind of mobile application, the performance of each version, and the development effort. With our results, we intend to provide an overview of the qualities and limitations of these frameworks.",

        "Abstract": "PHP is one of the most popular web development tools in use today. A major concern though is the improper and insecure uses of the language by application developers, motivating the development of various static analyses that detect security vulnerabilities in PHP programs. However, many of these approaches do not handle recent, important PHP features such as object orientation, which greatly limits the use of such approaches in practice. In this paper, we present OOPIXY, a security analysis tool that extends the PHP security analyzer PIXY to support reasoning about object-oriented features in PHP applications. Our empirical evaluation shows that OOPIXY detects 88% of security vulnerabilities found in micro benchmarks. When used on real-world PHP applications, OOPIXY detects security vulnerabilities that could not be detected using state-of-the-art tools, retaining a high level of precision. We have contacted the maintainers of those applications, and two applications' development teams verified the correctness of our findings. They are currently working on fixing the bugs that lead to those vulnerabilities.",

        "Abstract": "Developing an algorithm for a visualization prototype often involves the direct comparison of different development stages and design decisions, and even minor modifications may dramatically affect the results. While existing development tools provide visualizations for gaining general insight into performance and structural aspects of the source code, they neglect the central importance of result images unique to graphical algorithms. In this article, we present a novel approach that enables visualization programmers to simultaneously explore the evolution of their algorithm during the development phase together with its corresponding visual outcomes by providing an automatically updating meta visualization. Our interactive system allows for the direct comparison of all development states on both the visual and the source code level, by providing easy to use navigation and comparison tools. The on-the-fly construction of difference images, source code differences, and a visual representation of the source code structure further enhance the user's insight into the states' interconnected changes over time. Our solution is accessible via a web-based interface that provides GPU-accelerated live execution of C++ and GLSL code, as well as supporting a domain-specific programming language for scientific visualization.",

As IoT technologies such as smartwatches improve the quality of everyday living, people gradually rely more and more on connected devices. However, despite the exponential increase in popularity, the technologies used for connecting everyday devices and embedded computers to the Internet are still limited. While the range of programming languages and runtimes for web and desktop applications becomes wider, IoT development tools lack in diversity. In this context, this paper aims to adapt a new and popular programming language to be used for building Internet of Things applications. D is an accessible and widely used programming language, which is not currently designed to be used within the IoT domain. By adapting D to run on constrained devices, we desire to make IoT prototyping more accessible.",

        "Abstract": "The incorporation of FPGA-based System on Chip design courses in the curriculum of undergraduate and master's degree programs is becoming more and more common. The cost of development boards is prohibitive for most students, which is detrimental to their academic performance by limiting the number of hours they can devote to experimentation. The availability of a remote lab would solve this problem. This paper presents the infrastructure of a remote laboratory for the design of FPGA-based SoCs. This infrastructure is used in the teaching of a subject of the last year of an engineering degree. The environment allows the use of evaluation boards and development tools with full functionality. In addition, users can conveniently reserve the boards via a web application for use outside class hours and the infrastructure manages the simultaneous use of several boards, preventing users from interfering with each other's work. These advantages are complemented by the ability to virtualize user I/O interfaces and to use remote instrumentation to measure the response of the design.",

        "Abstract": "Advances in development and deployment of mobile business applications (MBAs) based on the hybrid Web approach (hybrid MBAs) create new possibilities for enterprises to mobilize their business processes (BPs). Despite the fact that variability has a natural appearance in complex environments among different enterprises, current development tools for hybrid MBAs are lacking systematic support for variable features. We analyse in this paper the formation of hybrid MBAs' variable workflows on the BP-level by conducting an exploratory study within the context of a real-world, widespread BP instance. We also discuss quality assurance of domain activity diagrams (DADs), which document variability in BPs' workflows. Novel verification techniques for a structural analysis of DADs are highlighted.",

        "Abstract": "Art’s remarkable ability to convey complex ideas with simplicity is a global phenomenon, yet some art forms struggle for recognition due to limited exposure or artists’ financial constraints. Bridging the gap between traditional art and modern society is crucial, and in the culturally rich TULUNADU region of Karnataka, this connection has been weak. This paper introduces a platform with an innovative recommendation engine to address this issue. It empowers patrons to explore artists’ work, make purchases, and engage directly with the creators. Using machine learning, the system tailors recommendations based on individual preferences. This platform is a product of advanced machine learning and web development tools, providing artists with analytics to refine their creative and promotional efforts. The proposed model boasts a 32% novelty rate and an impressive 99% diversity score, making it a valuable tool for marketing and recommending similar arts or products.",

        "Abstract": "Many cloud and cryptocurrency applications rely on verifying the integrity of outsourced computations, in which a verifier can efficiently verify the correctness of a computation made by an untrusted prover. State-of-the-art protocols for verifiable computation require that the computation task be expressed as arithmetic circuits, and the number of multiplication gates in the circuit is the primary metric that determines performance. At the present, a programmer could rely on two approaches for expressing the computation task, either by composing the circuits directly through low-level development tools; or by expressing the computation in a high-level program and rely on compilers to perform the program-to-circuit transformation. The former approach is difficult to use but on the other hand allows an expert programmer to perform custom optimizations that minimize the resulting circuit. In comparison, the latter approach is much more friendly to non-specialist users, but existing compilers often emit suboptimal circuits. We present xJsnark, a programming framework for verifiable computation that aims to achieve the best of both worlds: offering programmability to non-specialist users, and meanwhile automating the task of circuit size minimization through a combination of techniques. Specifically, we present new circuit-friendly algorithms for frequent operations that achieve constant to asymptotic savings over existing ones; various globally aware optimizations for short- and long- integer arithmetic; as well as circuit minimization techniques that allow us to reduce redundant computation over multiple expressions. We illustrate the savings in different applications, and show the framework's applicability in developing large application circuits, such as ZeroCash, while minimizing the circuit size as in low-level implementations.",

        "Abstract": "This project outlines the development of a mobile localization robot using ROS Noetic that is based on Lidar-SLAM technology. Using a RPlidar sensor and the SLAM algorithm, the robot is designed to locate its position and direction in an unknown environment, scanning its surroundings and localizing itself. The system is built with ROS, a popular robotics framework, and operates on the Ubuntu 20.0 virtual OS running on a MacOS Monterey host system, which provides an energy-efficient robotics hardware. The method employed in this study, Lidar-SLAM, creates a 2D representation of the environment and evaluates the robot's location and direction by analysing the point cloud data captured by the Lidar sensor. The robot has a differential drive system, which allows it to move and turn precisely in small places. The Arduino uno microcontroller present on the differential drive communicates with ROS via a USB serial peripheral between the Arduino and macOS host system. The proposed system has the potential to undergo real-world testing by placing the robot in an unfamiliar location and evaluating its performance based on how accurately it can localize and map the surroundings. This project provides a low-cost and small solution for mobile robot localization based on Lidar-SLAM technology, which can be scaled and utilized for a variety of applications including warehouse management, surveillance, and inspection. The ROS-based design enables for simple integration with other robotic systems and provides a comprehensive set of robotics development tools. With its low-cost and energy-efficient features, it offers an ideal base for further enhancing the robotic applications, particularly in remote or resource-constrained areas.",

The paper describes a Secure and Open Mobile Agent (SOMA) programming environment with two main design objectives that are security and interoperability. On the one hand SOMA is based on a thorough security model and provides a wide range of tools and mechanisms to build and enforce flexible security policies. On the other hand, the SOMA framework can interoperate with different application components designed with different programming styles. SOMA grants interoperability by closely considering compliance with CORBA, the most diffused standard in the area of Object-Oriented components. SOMA has been adopted as a platform to develop several distributed applications in the area of network and systems management, CSCW, and distributed and heterogeneous information systems.",

In this context it is essential to adopt tools which increase the productivity of the computational scientists without advanced training on grid technologies. To reduce the learning curve, we have augmented tools that most domain scientists are already familiar with, and hidden the complexity of the underlaying infrastructure, through automatic user interface generation and workflow support, beyond the standard command line based approach. Here we describe the current state of the infrastructure deployed and how it has facilitated the training of new researchers in the drug discovery area. We provide details on Vision, a visual programming environment used to define scientific workflows, and Opal, an automatic Web service wrappers for scientific applications on Grid resources, and how they are integrated with other established back-end technologies.",

        "Abstract": "Microsoft has introduced the .NET architecture as a new component-based programming environment, which allows for easy integration of classical distributed programming techniques with Web computing. NET defines a type system and introduces notions such as component, object, and interface, which are building blocks for distributed multi-language component-based applications. As many other component frameworks, .NET mainly focuses on functional interfaces of components. Non-functional aspects of components, such as resource usage (CPU, memory), timing behavior, fault-tolerance, or security requirements are currently not expressed in .NET's component interfaces. We discuss the usage of aspect-oriented programming techniques in context of the .NET framework. We focus on the fault-tolerance aspect and discuss the expression of non-functional component properties (aspects) as C# custom attributes. Our approach uses reflection to generate replicated objects based on settings of a special \"fault-tolerance\" attribute for C# components. We have implemented an aspect-weaver for integration of aspect-code and component-code, which uses the mechanisms of the language-neutral .NET type system. Therefore, our approach is not restricted to the C# language but works for any of the .NET programming languages.",

        "Abstract": "Motivates a variation of literate programming which I call \"elucidative programming\". Elucidative programming is oriented towards program explanation, with the purpose of throwing light on important and complex program relationships. Since it was proposed by D.E. Knuth (1984), literate programming has been one of the most viable approaches to radically improving internal program documentation. Unfortunately, most programmers find the ideas of literate programming, as supported by Web-like tools, far too impractical, academic and far-fetched in relation to current programming practices. With elucidative programming, I focus on the best ideas of literate programming. I disregard the program-publishing aspects as technical literature, and I provide mechanisms with which documentation can be added to a program without affecting or disturbing the source program. My ideas about elucidative programming are presented as a number of requirements, and in a discussion of programming environment issues in relation to these new ideas.",

        "Abstract": "One of the most important computational concepts in any programming language is procedural abstraction. We investigate the use of procedures in MIT App Inventor, a web-based blocks programming environment for creating Android mobile apps. We explore how procedures are used “in the wild” by examining two datasets of App Inventor projects: all projects of ten thousand randomly chosen users and all projects of all prolific users (those users with 20 or more projects). Our data analysis indicates that procedural abstraction is a concept that is learned over time by some App Inventor users, but it is used relatively infrequently, and features like parameters and returning values are used even more rarely. Procedures are most frequently called only once, indicating that they are often used to organize code rather than to reuse it. Surprisingly, 10% of declared procedures are never called, suggesting that this situation should be flagged by the environment.",

        "Abstract": "Single Board Computers (SBCs) are now emerging with multiple cores, ADCs, GPIOs, PWM channels, integrated graphics, and several serial bus interfaces. The low power consumption, small form factor and I/O interface capabilities of SBCs with sensors and actuators makes them ideal in embedded and real-time applications. However, most SBCs run non-realtime operating systems based on Linux and Windows, and do not provide a user-friendly API for application development. This paper presents QduinoMC, a multicore extension to the popular Arduino programming environment, which runs on the Quest real-time operating system. QduinoMC is an extension of our earlier single-core, real-time, multithreaded Qduino API. We show the utility of QduinoMC by applying it to a specific application: a web-connected 3D printer. This differs from existing 3D printers, which run relatively simple firmware and lack operating system support to spool multiple jobs, or interoperate with other devices (e.g., in a print farm). We show how QduinoMC empowers devices with the capabilities to run new services without impacting their timing guarantees. While it is possible to modify existing operating systems to provide suitable timing guarantees, the effort to do so is cumbersome and does not provide the ease of programming afforded by QduinoMC.",

This approach, strongly oriented towards web technologies, aims to offer the corporate application designer an integrated set of very high-level tools to design and test new services via functional composition of already available ones. The user experience is a mixture of (a) graphical actions and choices, for example the drag and drop of graphical widgets and the connection of input-output links, and of (b) interface coding, via the textual specification of the translation logic of data object types flowing through the input/output interfaces of the composed services. The new environment, named VisProSL (Visual Programming Service-Link), capitalizes on a standardized JSON syntax of exchanged data objects, is oriented to REST services, and makes use of a basic layer that provides the visual generation of interfaces towards location services.",

        "Abstract": "Since the source code is only one of many types of documents that must be maintained as a software system evolves, modern software development could be improved by better interoperability between source code and other software documents. The Software Concordance is a prototype programming environment that uses hypermedia services and a uniform document model to achieve this interoperability. The Software Concordance editor allows developers to enhance their inline documentation with multimedia objects and hyperlinks, while still supporting advanced program analysis including lexing, parsing and type checking. We motivate the need for environments like the Software Concordance, describe the design and implementation of its program editor, and discuss lessons learned while creating it. The system is based on a uniform, Web compatible document model for both program source code and nonprogram software documents and a corresponding API. Important technical problems addressed by this research include creating a persistent representation of program lexemes that the analysis suite considers to be ephemeral (such as keywords), providing a simple incremental parsing system, and embedding multimedia in source code without disrupting program analysis. Based on insight gained in the process of implementing the document API, a new approach to the design of a more suitable program analysis infrastructure is suggested.",

Technological progress has led to the younger generation forsaking the Batak language in their daily interactions, perceiving it as inconsequential to their social circle and contributing to the decline of regional languages. There is concern that regional languages, namely the Batak language, may lose significance or face extinction if this trend persists. This translation program is being implemented to aid in preserving regional languages, specifically the Batak language, enabling it to conform to contemporary circumstances. The development of this translation engine utilized the Batak language dictionary. The process of designing, coding, and testing is responsible for creating this direct machine translation. The BLEU score is employed to assess the caliber of machine translation. The study's findings indicate that the % BLEU value for ten sentences was 32.3%. This score falls within the category of sentences whose meaning can be understood, but the sentence structure still needs development. The direct machine translation developed in this Web platform is highly proficient and practical.",

We use the object specification language TROLL light to formalize the conceptual model of a system. A TROLL light specification describes structural as well as dynamic characteristics of objects representing real world entities. For validating specifications, we have developed an animation tool, allowing us to reflect structural properties and dynamic behaviour. The main concepts of the animator are illustrated by a working example. We present a simple specification of a car rental company and describe some of the steps performed during a typical animation session. The animation allows us to check whether desired properties are fulfilled by the given object descriptions. Finally, some design and implementation issues regarding the utilized persistent programming environment and the Web based user interface are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Robotics is very appealing and is long recognized as a great way to teach programming, while drawing inspiring connections to other branches of engineering and science such as maths, physics or electronics. Although this symbiotic relationship between robotics and programming is perceived as largely beneficial, educational approaches often feel the need to hide the underlying complexity of the robotic system, but as a result fail to transmit the reactive essence of robot programming to the roboticists and programmers of the future. This paper presents ROSY, a novel language for teaching novice programmers through robotics. Its functional style is both familiar with a high-school algebra background and a materialization of the inherent reactive nature of robotic programming. Working at a higher-level of abstraction also teaches valuable design principles of decomposition of robotics software into collections of interacting controllers. Despite its simplicity, ROSY is completely valid Haskell code compatible with the ROS ecosystem. We make a convincing case for our language by demonstrating how non-trivial applications can be expressed with ease and clarity, exposing its sound functional programming foundations, and developing a web-enabled robot programming environment.",

        "Abstract": "Programming education has been included in the curriculum of various university departments of for many years. It is possible to say that programming teaching has a valuable effect especially in Engineering education. With the development of mobile technologies in recent years, programming processes have begun to focus on web and mobile environments. For this reason, the importance of mobile programming teaching in universities has also increased. There are many programming languages and frameworks used to develop mobile programs. One of these platforms, Kuika, is an environment that is developed with the latest software technologies for the purpose of developing mobile applications, and offers rapid application development and new software capabilities with a model-based platform. In this study, it is aimed to design a 14-week course for mobile programming teaching in engineering education. In the designed course content, it is aimed to teach Kuika as a mobile programming environment. An effective course design facilitates the learning process of people and increases the effectiveness and quality of education. For this reason, instructional design, which is a systematic method based on learning and teaching theories that includes analysis of learners, objectives and content, methodology and finally evaluation, is important for content development studies. In this study, a course design for mobile programming education with Kuika was developed. During the course design process, the ADDIE instructional design model was used. This model includes the stages of analysis, design, development, implementation and evaluation.",

        "Abstract": "Feature location is a human-oriented and information-intensive process. When performing feature location tasks with existing tools, developers often feel it difficult to formulate an accurate feature query (e.g., keywords) and determine the relevance of returned results. In this paper, we propose a feature location approach that supports multi-faceted interactive program exploration. Our approach automatically extracts and mines multiple syntactic and semantic facets from candidate program elements. Furthermore, it allows developers to interactively group, sort, and filter feature location results in a centralized, multi-faceted, and intelligent search User Interface (UI). We have implemented our approach as a web-based tool MFIE and conducted an experimental study. The results show that the developers using MFIE can accomplish their feature location tasks 32% faster and the quality of their feature location results (in terms of F-measure) is 51% higher than that of the developers using regular Eclipse IDE.",

        "Abstract": "This article introduces the objectives and structure of the European research project DESERVE that is co-funded by the ARTEMIS-JU and national funding bodies. The project started in September 2012 with a duration of 3 years. The project aims to establish a new embedded SW and HW design by using a more efficient development process (including the enabling general platform concept and tool chain) in order to overcome challenges in reducing component costs and development time of future ADAS functions for modern vehicles. Both the process and the platform concept will be demonstrated with innovative ADAS functions in 3 passenger cars, 1 truck and 1 motorcycle. Embedded hardware and software units have been developed for improving electronic horizon band of vehicles by detecting objects in front. Moreover, driver/motorcycle rider awareness is analysed by monitoring his/her actions online. The systems need to be robust and reliable in different environment conditions (night time, rain, etc.). The DESERVE platform distinguishes three layers of intelligence: perception, application and intervention&warning control. The demonstrators will be based on software development tools from Elektrobit (ADTF) and Intempora (RTmaps). These tools are used to create 10 innovative ADAS applications as part of an integral ADAS development platform, following a new design and development process. Since the project is highly application oriented, the requirements have been adapted mainly from the ISO 26262 standard and the AUTOSAR framework which ensures compatibility with the existing automotive software environment.",

In the case of smart home environment, the result is the introduction of smart, connected domotic devices, featuring enhanced intelligence. In combination with enhanced capabilities for sensing, controlling and automatic, the power of these devices can be further exploited by the use of a semantic connection layer that can facilitate a goal-oriented collaboration between devices and a meaningful interaction with humans. This paper proposes an integrated platform, enabling dynamic injection of automation rules based on semantic web technologies, in a collective intelligence environment. The role of the human - end user in this environment is supported through a user friendly IDE enabling the easy discovery, access and operation, through the introduction of automation rules.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper we present a new approach to flipping large introductory programming classes that we call the Solve-Then-Debug approach. This is a Computer Supported Agile Teaching methodology in which students solve problems using a web-based IDE we created, Spinoza, and then start reviewing failed attempts by their peers to classify the errors and comment on them. The classification and comment information is then made available as a hint to those students still trying to solve the problem when they encounter a similar error. Spinoza provides a wide variety of visualizations and dashboards that allow the instructor to closely monitor the progress of the students in this activity and to pivot to another phase of the activity at the appropriate time. It also has features that allow the instructor to easily detect and intervene with students who have failed to demonstrate mastery of the skills and concepts covered in that lesson. Spinoza builds on the ideas behind several other recent systems and this paper demonstrates that the Solve-Then-Debug approach can successfully keep all students actively engaged in learning coding skills even when there is a large range of skills in the class.",

        "Abstract": "For innovative portable products, Systems on Chips (SoCs) containing several processors, memories and specialised modules are obviously required. Performances but also low-power are main issues in the design of such SoCs. Are these low-power SoCs only constructed with low-power processors, memories and logic blocks? If the latter are unavoidable, many other issues are quite important for low-power SoCs, such as the way to synchronise the communications between processors as well as test procedures, online testing, software design and development tools. This paper is a general framework for the design of low-power SoCs, starting from the system level to the architecture level, assuming that the SoC is mainly based on the re-use of low-power processors, memories and logic peripherals. SoCs with many processors, co-processors, memories and peripherals cannot be synchronised with a single master clock, due to larger and larger wire delays in deep submicron technologies. Several clocking schemes have been proposed, such as GALS (Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous) but also full asynchronous architectures. This paper will present the advantages and disadvantages of these SoC clocking strategies as well as the impacts on low power. For embedded SoCs containing several processors, one has to write several pieces of software for each processor starting typically from a high-level specification using the C/C++ language. In order to tackle this problem, we propose to first transform the original specification by means of a systematic script of platform-independent source code transformations. That is illustrated by applying global loop transformation techniques to identify asynchronous partitions exhibiting little communication and high locality of access characteristics. In a second stage, we explore multiple-instruction multiple-data (MIMD) mapping onto a given (partly) predefined platform using advanced space-time analysis techniques to maintain low data transfer rates while achieving high system throughput. At the SoC level, accurate cost feedback including high-level power estimation is required. From this essential information, energy trade-offs between application sub-modules can for example be used to refine the solution further. In the case of mapping onto programmable cores with a shared memory hierarchy, a final refinement consists in reorganising the data layout for efficient cache utilisation.",

In the context of business process modeling and execution a frictionless mapping between high level, platform independent business process definition and platform specific, executable code has to be achieved. In this paper we compare two existing real world mapping scenarios of IBM and Microsoft concerning Web service orchestration. One \"top-down\" approach starting with high-level UML models down to executable code, the other as a \"bottom-up\" approach, with proprietary modeling integrated within the IDE. We try to answer the question how far both proposals implemented the MDA concept yet and discuss how they could support our current project of a service oriented architecture for the manufacturing shop floor domain.",

        "Abstract": "Communication is essential for the success of student and professional software engineering (SE) team development projects. The projects delivered by SE courses provide valuable learning experiences for students because they teach industry-required skills such as teamwork, communication, and scheduling. Professional SE teams have adopted communication software such as Slack, Miro, Microsoft Teams, and GitHub Discussions to share files and convey information between team members. Likewise, they have distributed software development tools such as Visual Studio CodeSpaces and Jira to support productivity. In contrast, within academia, students have focused on having face-to-face meetings for team communication and communication tools for file sharing. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, universities have been forced to switch to an online or hybrid modality abruptly, thus compelling SE students to quickly adopt communication software. This paper proposes a study on the use of communication software in industry to prepare students for remote software development positions after graduation.",

        "Abstract": "Code smells are inherently subjective in nature. Software developers may have different opinions and perspectives on smelly code. While many attempts have been made to use deep learning-based models for code smell detection, they fail to consider each developer’s subjective perspective while detecting smells. Ignoring this aspect defies the purpose of using deep learning-based smell detection methods because the models are not customized to the developer’s context. This paper proposes a method that considers human feedback to account for such subjectivity. Towards this, we created a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA and developed a container-based web-server to offer services of our baseline deep learning model. The setup allowed developers to see code smells within the IDE and provide feedback. Using this setup, we conducted a controlled experiment with 14 participants divided into experimental and control groups. In the first round of our experiment, we show code smells predicted using the baseline deep learning model and collect feedback from the participants. In the second round, we fine-tune the model based on the experimental group’s feedback and reevaluate its performance before and after adjustment. Our results show that using such calibration improves the performance of the smell detection model by 15.49% in F1 score on average across the participants of the experimental group. Our work carries implications for both researchers and practitioners. Practitioners can apply our approach to enhance the quality of their code in day-to-day development activities, aligning it with their own code smell definitions. Furthermore, software engineering researchers can leverage this study to adopt analogous approaches for addressing similar issues, including code review.",

Existing studies however ignore developer feedback and their influence on the developer strategy for getting help during maintenance tasks. We used the Grounded Theory approach to investigate screen capture videos from an experiment to find which information sources developers use to find help and what is their relevance. We compared the frequency as well as the sequence patterns of used information sources both for the developers using coupled change suggestions and those not using them. We found a set of information sources where the developers seek for help and identified two categories of relevance. Also, we discovered that for the tasks using coupled change suggestions, the developers used mostly the internal IDE elements as an information source whereby the developers not using coupled change suggestions often used external sources like the documentation or the web. Coupled change suggestions influence the strategy how the developers seek for help by reducing the search for information on external locations which makes the process of solving maintenance tasks more compact.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding how software works and building code has been a basic requirement for every student. Programming skills vary from person to person and even from language to language. Monitoring the student performance is evident to assess and improve programming skills. Though e-learning courses have paved the way to a different structure of learning, it is way more important to practice under supervision. The proposed model aims to automate the process of lab evaluation and assessment of programming subjects in the curriculum. The basic idea is to bring the IDE of various programming languages(C, C++, Python, Java, C#, goLang, JS) to construct a single platform to write code. The automated platform consists of different types of modules. Faculty module can add, modify or delete questions. According to the sections and subjects allocated, the faculty can observe the performance trends of all the students of the section in a given language. Test cases will be provided for each question. In student module, the student will be able to see all the programming subjects according to the section. Percentage, grades and marks will be provided based on the completion of test cases. Student profile demonstrates the whole details of the student. In admin module, the admin will have access to the overall website, to add faculty and student details. This project is being built using MERN stack web development. This automated tool will be very useful in assessing the students and provide accurate results.",

In this work, we focus on users' communication considering personality as a key characteristic for identifying communicative networks i.e., networks with high information flows. We describe the Twitter Personality based Communicative Communities Extraction (T-PCCE) system that identifies the most communicative communities in a Twitter network graph considering users' personality. We then expand existing approaches in users' personality extraction by aggregating data that represent several aspects of user behavior using machine learning techniques. We use an existing modularity based community detection algorithm and we extend it by inserting a post-processing step that eliminates graph edges based on users' personality. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by sampling the Twitter graph and comparing the communication strength of the extracted communities with and without considering the personality factor. We define several metrics to count the strength of communication within each community. Our algorithmic framework and the subsequent implementation employ the cloud infrastructure and use the MapReduce Programming Environment. Our results show that the T-PCCE system creates the most communicative communities.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years we have witnessed the emergence of the FPGA in many high-performance systems. This is due to FPGA's high reconfigurability and improved user-friendly programming environment. OpenCL, supported by major FPGA vendors, is a high-level programming platform that liberates hardware developers from having to deal with the complex and error-prone HDL development. While OpenCL exposes a GPU-like programming model, which is well-suited for compute-intensive tasks, in many state-of-art systems that deploy FPGA, we observe that the workloads are streaming-like, which is communication-intensive. This mismatch leads to low throughput and high end-to-end latency. In this paper, we propose ST-Accel, a new high-level programming platform for streaming applications on FPGA. It has the following advantages: (i) ST-Accel adopts the multiprocessing programming model to capture the inherent pipeline-level parallelism of streaming applications while reducing the end-to-end latency. (ii) A message-passing-based host/FPGA communication model is used to avoid the coherency issue of shared memory, thus enabling host/FPGA communication during kernel execution. (iii) ST-Accel provides a high-level abstraction for I/O devices to support direct I/O device access that eliminates the overhead of host CPU and reduces the I/O latency. (iv) ST-Accel enables the decoupled access/execute architecture to maximize the utilization of I/O devices. (v) The host/FPGA communication interface is redesigned to cater to the demands of both latency-critical and throughput-critical scenarios. The experimental results on the Amazon AWS cloud and local machine show that ST-Accel can achieve 1.6X-166X throughput and 1/3 latency for typical streaming workloads when compared to OpenCL.",

        "Abstract": "The standard tools for cloud computing — processor and network virtualization — make it difficult to achieve dependability, both in terms of real time operations and fault tolerance. Virtualization multiplexes virtual resources onto physical ones, typically by time division or statistical multiplexing. Time, in the virtual machine, is therefore as virtual as the machine itself. And fault tolerance is difficult to achieve when redundancy and independent failure in the virtual environment do not necessarily map to those properties in the physical environment. Virtualization adds a level of indirection that creates overhead, and makes it all but impossible to achieve predictable performance. Osprey uses an alternative to virtualization that achieves the same goals of scalability and flexibility but carries neither the overhead of virtualization, nor the restrictions on dependability. The result is a programming environment that achieves most of the compatibility offered by traditional virtualization efforts and provides much better and much more predictable performance. One technique we use is called Library OS, which stems from high-performance computing. The technique consists of linking applications with a library that implements most services normally provided by the operating system, creating an application that can run practically stand alone, or at least with a very minimal operating system. The Library OS approach moves the boundary between application and operating system down to a level where interactions with the operating system consist of sending/receiving messages (e.g., network packets) and scheduling resources (processor, memory, network bandwidth, and device access). These interactions, as we demonstrate, form a relatively weak bond between an application and the particular instance of the operating system on which it runs — one that can be broken and re-established elsewhere. In fact, we make sure this is the case. Legacy applications that cannot be recompiled or relinked can make use of a Library OS server that runs as a tandem process along with the legacy application processes. System calls from the legacy process are catapulted into the Library OS server which executes them. Applications can still migrate, taking their server process along with them. © 2012 Alcatel-Lucent.",

        "Abstract": "Registration of partial scan data sets is still a challenge for today's CAD systems and CAD system users. Many of the known methods rely on user interaction or feature recognition. For non-regular users this is too time consuming and error prone. The paper describes a method to register partial scan data by fitting a large fat tetrahedron (LFT) in the target point cloud. The method is computational intensive and in its CPU implementation not fit for interactive use. The independency of the points in the data-sets makes massive parallel computing applicable. The paper describes the implementation of the method on a GTX260 GPU using the CUDA programming environment. A performance gain of 10 times compared to a conventional CPU implementation was achieved, which can be further improved by implementing a pre selection method of the result, bringing interactive use in range after further optimization.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents a new model for a data management system specifically designed to enable community-curated data repositories and collaboration. Depot (a Dependence-Eager Platform of Transformations) is based on a data-lake approach that eases the technological burdens associated with data contribution while providing an interactive programming environment for developing transformations that result in structured tables supporting SQL database operations. Crucially, Depot implements lazy evaluation of these transformations so that only the structured data that is demanded by a data consumer is generated. Until the structured data is \"materialized,\" Depot tracks and maintains the dependencies that are required to perform the eventual materialization. This lazy approach to creating structured data allows Depot to maintain a smaller resource footprint compared to a typical data warehouse approach while maintaining the flexibility of the data lake model. Furthermore, Depot is designed as a community-sustainable platform. The initial prototype is implemented for cloud deployment and it distributes the storage and ETL workload cost among the data consumers. Performance results of the early prototype are encouraging, making Depot a new infrastructure for creating data lakes that foster contributed-consumer collaboration.",

        "Abstract": "In today’s world, many Internets of Things (IoT) system has been developed in the agriculture sector, especially in fish breeding. Anabas Testudineus (Puyu fish) is one of the favorite aquatic creatures that have been bred for commercials used and needs to be handled carefully for their healthier life habitats. Aquarium’s water becomes unclean due to the reproduction of algae, waste from the fish, the palette, and others. Hence, a Smart IoT-Based Aquarium Monitoring System for Anabas Testudineus (AMSAT) has been designed and deployed to ensure that the water in the aquarium is safe and clean for Anabas Testudineus breeding. NodeMCU controller was used and connected to pH and temperature sensors with an embedded Wi-Fi module built into the microcontroller allows the smartphone to connect with the cloud for real-time data collection. The Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) and Lighting Emitting Diode (LED) are connected to view information on the water condition. Arduino software (IDE) is used to generate code while the Blynk data analytic platform will presents analyzed data via a smartphone. Four tests were done to measure the pH level after feeding the fish with and without a water filter in 2 and 3 days. Results present the pH value has dropped the lowest for Test 2 at 5.66 pH value compared to 7.17, 7.31, and 7.06 after feeding the fish for 2 days and with filters. This system has been successfully viewed and monitored in real-time via Blynk mobile apps on the pH and temperature levels. This research is significant for Anabas Testudineus breeders that support the agriculture sector for recent technology deployment.",

        "Abstract": "The accelerated advancement and ubiquitous adoption of smart vehicles, coupled with the Internet of Things (IoT), has propelled the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to prominence as a pivotal and expansive area of research within the IoT sphere. An important challenge in IoV design lies in the efficient execution of data storage and sharing mechanisms. The successful implementation of blockchain technology across various disciplines has sparked intrigue amongst researchers to unearth its potential applicability within the IoV context. In the related works, Blockchain-based IoV systems are usually composed of three layers: the vehicle layer, the roadside units (RSUs) layer, and the blockchain or cloud layer. The RSUs layer is often required to perform numerous tasks throughout the system. Stability during rush hours is worth considering. RSUs need to receive a lot of data during rush hours and may also undertake data computing tasks. Based on the characteristics of distributed ledges, the issue of substantial storage overhead looms as a complex problem with the escalating size of the block list. Although some solutions are being proposed, such as fragmented ledger, there are still security concerns. Data security cannot be guaranteed while reducing storage overhead. To combat the stability and cost concerns associated with Roadside Units (RSUs), we delegate the majority of RSU functionalities to other layers of the system. Further, we incorporate a secure blockchain strategy – deploying an outer and inner blockchain to fortify the security and resilience of the overall blockchain network. Based on the autonomous execution characteristics of smart contracts, we try to use smart contracts for data transmission. We use Solidity to write the smart contract and test it on the Remix IDE with the aim of testing the smart contract's operability in terms of data transmission. We scrutinise the data transmission process via smart contracts, and the empirical results corroborate the effectiveness of our uniquely designed process.",

This project is designed to defend the electrical circuitry by utilizing an electromechanical relay. The relay is used to switch off the main electrical supply by operating the circuit breaker. Whenever the permanent exceeded its predefined values, the system is set to send alerts by SMS. This system mainly slows two specific lines to show the operating and controlling of the particular lines at the grid. In this project, both hardware design and software design (design on proteus) of “GSM and IoT based Automated Embedded System for Monitoring and Controlling of Smart Grid” is presented. Arduino IDE software is for the simulation of the proposed system. The microcontroller (Arduino NANO) is appraised as the main brain of the system. There were two Arduinos and one ESP-8266 controller (used as a Wi-Fi module). This proposed system can perform multiple working sections such as protection, monitoring, controlling and can store the entire data in the cloud and show it on the device's display app. This project convinces the goal of modern science and technology which provides satisfaction and comfort to the people who perform jobs at Power Grid companies. The Power Grid companies will be benefitted from this project and it will be productive for the environment as well as the society.",

To improve the system performance, it is necessary that the Cloudlets scheduled on the resources available must be efficiently executed. For scientific applications, workflow scheduling is a significant issue. To handle this issue, a new mechanism called Enhanced Min-Min (E-Min-Min) is introduced inspired by the Min-Min algorithm. This scheduling algorithm not only schedules the jobs according to their completion time but considers the data transfer time too with equal priority and makes an aggregated function for scheduling of jobs to the best suitable resources. During the scheduling process, the main focus is on the minimization of Makespan, maximize the resource utilization and load balance level and also minimize the cost of scheduling. Workflow scientific applications such as Montage, Cybershake, InSpiral, SIPHT are considered. In workflow the tasks are represented as nodes and their dependencies represents the relationships among them. WorkflowSim simulator with Net Beans IDE is used to create the simulation environment and the results are validated over it. The proposed algorithm shows the better results as compared with the basic Min-Min and Modified Min-Min algorithm.",

The proposed robot is designed to navigate through its environment autonomously and avoid obstacles in its path using an ultrasonic sensor. It also includes a servo motor for steering and a gear motor for driving the wheels. The robot can be controlled using various modes, including voice mode, terminal mode, and Bluetooth mode. The voice mode allows the user to communicate with the robot using voice commands, while the terminal mode enables the user to send commands to the robot through a terminal window. The Bluetooth mode allows the user to control the robot wirelessly using a smartphone or a tablet. The proposed system uses an Arduino board as the microcontroller, which is programmed using the Arduino IDE. The IoT capabilities are implemented using a Wi-Fi module, which enables the robot to connect to the internet and be controlled remotely from anywhere in the world. The robot's data, including its location and sensor readings, are transmitted to a cloud-based platform using MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol. The system's versatility and multiple control modes make it suitable for various applications, including home automation, security, and surveillance, and industrial automation. Overall, the proposed system provides a cost-effective solution for building a versatile and efficient obstacle avoidance robot with multi-control systems using IoT.",

        "Abstract": "The popularity of computer science classes offered through Massive Open On-line Courses (MOOCs) creates both opportunities and challenges. Programming-based classes need to provide consistent development infrastructures that are both scalable and user friendly to students. The \"Heterogeneous Parallel Programming\" class offered through Coursera teaches GPU programming and encountered these problems. We developed WebGPU -- an online GPU development platform -- providing students with a user friendly scalable GPU computing platform throughout the course. It has been used as the CUDA, OpenACC, and OpenCL programming environment for large Coursera courses, short-running summer schools, and traditional semester-long graduate and undergraduate courses. WebGPU has since replaced our traditional development infrastructure for the GPU classes offered at UIUC. This paper presents the original, revised, and upcoming WebGPU designs that address the requirements and challenges of offering sophisticated computing resources to a large, quickly-varying number of students.",

        "Abstract": "This Full Paper in the Research Category evaluates the use of remixing in Scratch. A feature of the Scratch programming environment is that it supports students to share their code and “remix” (modify) other students' code. Remixing in Scratch has garnered much attention by the research community as use of collaboration for learning was one of the main ideas behind Scratch. It can provide opportunities to read others' code, learn how features can be implemented using the Scratch language, and contribute to the program. It can also prevent students from engaging with the code if they copy an existing program that does what they are trying to do without needing modification. The literature shows mixed results regarding use of remixes in Scratch. We have investigated at a large scale what happens in practice by analysing thousands of student programs shared through the Scratch online repository. As well as replicating prior work on a larger scale to show the impact of remixing on learning programming skills through Lines of Code (LOC) and repertoire of block usage, we also measure the use of elementary patterns (common combinations of commands). We track the progress of each project through its remixes and compare the results between the root version and the final version.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we present Sorotoki, an open-source toolkit in MATLAB that offers a comprehensive suite of tools for the design, modeling, and control of soft robots. The complexity involved in researching and building soft robots often stems from the interconnectedness of design and control aspects, which are rarely addressed together as a unified problem. To address such complex interdependencies in soft robotics, the Sorotoki toolkit provides a comprehensive and modular programming environment composed of seven Object-Oriented classes. These classes are designed to work together to solve a wide range of soft robotic problems, offering versatility and flexibility for its users. We provide here a comprehensive overview of the Sorotoki software architecture to highlight its usage and applications. The details and interconnections of each module are thoroughly described, collectively explaining how to gradually introduce modeling complexity for various soft robotic scenarios. The effectiveness of Sorotoki is also demonstrated through a range of case studies, including novel problem scenarios and established works widely recognized in the soft robotics community. These case studies cover a broad range of research problems, including: inverse design of soft actuators, passive and active soft locomotion, object manipulation with soft grippers, meta-materials, model reduction, model-based control of soft robots, and online shape estimation. Additionally, the toolkit provides access to four open-hardware soft robotic systems that can be fabricated using commercially available 3D printers.

        "Abstract": "Reviews have a direct impact on customer satisfaction. The aim of this study is to dissect and analyze a collection of 775 negative and 557 positive comment reviews, drawn from four distinct e-commerce platforms. By classifying these remarks into positive and negative sentiments, this research endeavors to illuminate underlying trends permeating these marketplaces. The research methodology employed involves field observations of online shopping experiences, utilizing data derived from 254 e-commerce customers. These data were collected via validated questionnaires and subsequently analyzed using the partial least squares structural equation modeling approach, employing the lavaan r library within the R programming environment. The questionnaire results produced a rating scale from 1 to 5, categorizing responses from “very satisfied” to “less satisfied”, effectively illustrating both positive and negative commentary. The field comment data collected was coordinated with comment data extracted from four marketplace trading accounts. This data comment customer was analyzed using a range of comparative models such as k-nearest neighbors, multinomial naive bayes, stochastic gradient descent, and decision trees to conduct sentiment analysis. The findings reveal that the naive bayes method generates the greatest accuracy in sentiment analysis, registering an accuracy value of 0.886. Moreover, the analysis executed through r programming indicates that the e-service quality model yields the most robust results, reflected by an adjusted r-square value of 0.885. This study exerts a notable impact on service quality, as evidenced by a coefficient value of 0.865 and a perceived reputation score of 0.162.",

        "Abstract": "Currently grid application developers often configure available application components into a workflow of tasks that they can submit for executing on the grid. In this paper, we present an abstract grid workflow language (AGWL) for describing grid workflow applications at a high level of abstraction. AGWL has been designed such that the user can concentrate on specifying grid applications without dealing with either the complexity of the grid or any specific implementation technology (e.g. Web service). AGWL is an XML-based language which allows a programmer to define a graph of activities that refer mostly to computational tasks. Activities are connected by control and data flow links. A rich set of constructs (compound activities) is provided to simplify the specification of grid workflow applications which includes compound activities such as if, forEach and while loops as well as advanced compound activities including parallel sections, parallel loops and collection iterators. Moreover, AGWL supports a generic high level access mechanism to data repositories. AGWL is the main interface to the ASKALON grid application development environment and has been applied to numerous real world applications. We describe a material science workflow that has been successfully ported to a grid infrastructure based on an AGWL specification. Only a dozen AGWL activities are needed to describe a workflow with several hundred activity instances.",

        "Abstract": "Extreme programming (XP) is a well known agile software development method. While a number of experience reports have been published in recent years, agile software development in general and XP in particular have strongly been criticized for the lack of empirical data. This paper reports a survey of the empirical data obtained from a controlled case study on extreme programming in practical settings. Thus, no hypotheses were set a priori. Four software engineers were acquired to implement a Web-based system (7698 Locs, 820 hours) for data management in a delivery schedule of eight weeks. Development environment was close to the agile home ground. Collected empirical data is grounded on three basic data points: time, size and defects. Data is organized around five system releases, each which were tested by 17 customer testers. System release defect-density was 1.43 defects/KLOC, team overall productivity 16.90 Locs/hour and rework costs were 9.8% of the total development effort. The implications of this study are discussed.",

The code and construction plans are publicly available to enable rebuilding the CPM Lab.Our four-layered architecture enables the seamless use of the same software in simulations and in experiments without any further adaptions. A Data Distribution Service (DDS) based middleware allows adapting the number of vehicles during experiments in a seamless manner. The middleware is also responsible for synchronizing all entities following a logical execution time approach to achieve determinism and reproducibility of experiments. This approach makes the CPM Lab a unique platform for rapid functional prototyping of networked decision-making algorithms.The CPM Lab allows researchers as well as students from different disciplines to see their ideas developing into reality. We demonstrate its capabilities using two example experiments. We are working on a remote access to the CPM Lab via a web-interface.",

The project, related to Micromouse, Robotrace (Robotrace is the title of Taiwanese and Japanese robot races), and line-maze contests was developed by the embedded control system research group of the Department of Electronic Engineering, Lunghwa University of Science and Technology, Taiwan. It targets both those students who have to earn credits for a one-year special topics course and those who are just interested in making robots, and it is designed to motivate them to learn digital motion control, path planning, attitude correction, curvature detection and maze-solving algorithms. The students begin by getting acquainted with the development environment of microcontrollers, the characteristics of different sensors, and servomotor control techniques. Having learned these basic skills, they acquire further specific advanced skills and proceed to design their own mobile robots to compete in contests. The special topics course students' robots must pass examination by five teachers. Blogs and a wiki Web site for recording students' progress and experiences enhance the project's learning outcomes. Although not every student wins a prize in the contests, student feedback still shows that the contest-oriented project did motivate them to acquire the skills necessary to build and operate intelligent mobile robots.",

        "Abstract": "Advanced sensing, data analysis and communication techniques have led to the emergence and tremendous development of industrial internet of things (IIoT) in recent years, which raises revolution in condition monitoring and maintenance for electrical assets. An open ecosystem for future IIoT is proposed in this paper and the architecture of the open ecosystem is discussed. An open development environment needs to be established for users to interact with power devices and servers freely via web or mobile applications installed on user terminals, increasing IIoT scalability and flexibility. The core technologies of open ecosystem in future IIoT are discussed, which include comprehensive sensing techniques, wide-area communication tools, Big Data service infrastructure, data analysis algorithms and intelligent maintenance schemes. An application of future IIoT ecosystem in wind farm maintenance is then presented. It is demonstrated that the efficiency and effectiveness of wind farm maintenance can be improved with the support of open ecosystem of future IIoT, providing an innovative insight for electrical assets monitoring and maintenance with high reliability.",

        "Abstract": "WebIDE is a new web-based development environment for entry-level programmers with two primary goals: minimize tool barriers to writing computer programs and introduce software engineering best practices early in a student's educational career. Currently, WebIDE focuses on Test-Driven Learning (TDL) by using small iterative examples and introducing lock-step labs, which prevent the student from moving forward until they finish the current step. However, WebIDE does not require that labs follow TDL. Instructors can write their own labs for WebIDE using any software engineering or pedagogical approach. Likewise, instructors can build custom evaluators - written in any language - to support their approach and provide detailed error messages to students. We report on a pilot study in a CS0 course where students were split into two groups, one that used WebIDE and one that didn't. The WebIDE group showed a significant improvement in performance when writing a simple Android application. Additionally, among students with some programming experience, the WebIDE group was more proficient in writing unit tests.",

In a large software development environment, finding a relevant use case from a large use case library created in the past or related projects is a complex, error-prone and expensive task. Based on the semantic Web approach, we propose an ontological methodology to support this task. We use ontology to augment use cases with semantic information. This ontology is derived from ResearchCyc ontology. We also propose the augmentation of queries used to retrieve use cases with this ontology.

        "Abstract": "Eco-efficient anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANAMMOX) can eliminate toxic nutrients from wastewater and has been used in several nutrient removal technologies. However, its implementation for robust operation remains challenging because of process nonlinearity and time-variant characteristic, higher energy consumption, excess sludge produced, and biomass loss during sludge pumping. Also, sensor failure, process startup, and shut down present additional difficulties. In this article, an intelligent human–machine interface using an advanced numerical solution for a knowledge-based system (called ANKSys) was developed by integrating the fully optimized-functionality (soft sensing, decision making, and simulating model) data driven by supervisory control. This control consists of advanced algorithms (artificial neural network, Kalman filter, principal component analysis, least-square technique/renowned root-mean-squared error) using commercial software (MATLAB R2018a, Microsoft Visual Studio IDE 2016, Microsoft SQL Server 2014, OPC Automation with XGT series programmable logic controller). The developed ANKSys can help in online monitoring and optimal process operation by assessing risk and failure occurrences, acquiring data for data analysis, and managing operating expenditure. In real-time implementation, ANKSys enhanced the energy efficiency, i.e., 16% of a pilot-scale “LEAOX” wastewater treatment plant located at Daegu, Republic of Korea. Using this strategy, an optimal and sustainable operation for the removal of biological nitrogen was achieved.",

        "Abstract": "In the pharmaceutical industry, problems like counterfeit drugs, including vaccines, and their supply chain management problems like transparency, immutability, and traceability exist. In the case of vaccines, it becomes more difficult to standardize and detect fake vaccines because the public has less awareness and knowledge about vaccines. Moreover, the increase in online pharmacies gives more opportunities for counterfeiting vaccines to enter the authentic supply chain management system. We present transparent, immutable and secure vaccine supply chain (TISVSchain), a framework based on blockchain to handle the issues of counterfeited vaccines and vaccine supply chain problems like transparency, immutability, and traceability. Our proposed framework can run both on the private and public blockchain. We have implemented the framework on public blockchain by using remix ide and the smart contracts designed by solidity language run on very low gas cost. We also carried out several experiments by changing the number of nodes and their block time to evaluate the performance of our framework in terms of transaction per second (TPS), gas cost, and propagation delay. Our proposed framework improves the security by using offline unique account addresses in blockchain-based frameworks and improves the overall efficiency of the framework by keeping the gas cost low, finding a way to decrease the number of lost blocks to keep low propagation delay, and keeping high TPS value. TISVSchain shows us promising results to improve vaccine supply chain management’s overall performance, security, and efficiency.",

        "Abstract": "The development of a distributed testing environment would have to comply with recent Department of Defense (DoD) mandates requiring that the DoD architectural framework (DoDAF) be adopted to express high level system and operational requirements and architectures. Unfortunately, DoDAF and DoD net-centric mandates pose significant challenges to testing and evaluation since DoDAF specifications must be evaluated to see if they meet requirements and objectives, yet they are not expressed in a form that is amenable to such evaluation. DoDAF is the basis for integrated architectures and provides broad levels of specification related to operational, system, and technical views. In our earlier work, we described an approach to support specification of DoDAF architectures within a development environment based on DEVS (discrete event system specification) for semi-automated construction of the needed simulation models. The result is an enhanced system lifecycle development process that includes both development and testing in an integral manner. We also developed automated model generation using XML which paves the way for OVs to become service-providing components in the Web services architecture. In this paper we present the semantic structure for one of the operational view documents OV-6a that would aid the development of these semi-automated models. We will describe how 0V-6a can be structured in a more generalized meta-model framework such that every rule is reducible to meaningful code which is automatedly constructed through natural language processing (NLP) methods and further be reduced to DEVS based models. The paper also presents an overview of the life-cycle development methodology for these enterprise architectures and how a common enterprise domain-model can be used in customized business/domain-specific rules and policy structures",

This deficiency is exacerbated by complexities associated with the development environment and the language syntax that novices are expected to use. Many novices engage in program development without possessing an appropriate model of an algorithmic solution. Progranimate is a web enabled e-learning tool that focuses the novice on the algorithmic processes of programming using flowcharts to assist them in overcoming their problem-solving weaknesses. The code generation, variable inspection and animation features expose students to language syntax, semantics and code execution in a dynamic and interactive environment and provides in depth insight into computer program development. While evaluation is ongoing, initial pilots with several student groups has given the tool a positive response.",

        "Abstract": "Plugin-based application design has become increasingly popular in recent years, and has contributed to the success of a range of very different applications including Mozilla Firefox and the Eclipse development environment. Using plugins is a promising approach to build complex systems that have to be reconfigured at runtime, and several plugin based general purpose runtime environments are currently under development. Plugin-based design is based on the idea that plugins provide additional functionality extending the capabilities of a core product. While this is often understood as providing services by implementing abstract classes or interfaces defined in the core product, modern plugin-based systems like Eclipse use a much wider definition of service. We propose to consider these services as typed resources and introduce a contract language that can be used to define contracts between plugins providing and consuming services. This language is based on the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) that has a well-defined syntax and semantics. These contracts can then be used in order to validate complex, plugin-based applications.",

        "Abstract": "Programmers often omit input validation when inputs can appear in many different formats or when validation criteria cannot be precisely specified. To enable validation in these situations, we present a new technique that puts valid inputs into a consistent format and that identifies \"questionable\" inputs which might be valid or invalid, so that these values can be double-checked by a person or a program. Our technique relies on the concept of a \"tope\", which is an application-independent abstraction describing how to recognize and transform values in a category of data. We present our definition of topes and describe a development environment that supports the implementation and use of topes. Experiments with web application and spreadsheet data indicate that using our technique improves the accuracy and reusability of validation code and also improves the effectiveness of subsequent data cleaning such as duplicate identification.",

        "Abstract": "During the last years the hardware description languages evolved providing a faster and a more generic way of describing synthesizable hardware architectures. E.g., VHDL 2008 extended the concept of generics from integral numbers to types, packages and subroutines. This paper presents a hardware description language based on the VHDL semantics - THDL++. It supports the extended generic concept and improves it further by supporting compile-time lists with “for each” semantics, inheritance, expression type derivation and late binding. We also present THDL++ compiler with 2 back-ends: a synthesizable VHDL-87 back-end makes it easy to integrate THDL++ into any existing design flow, and a C++ back-end that generates a cycle-accurate model for fast simulation. We illustrate how using THDL++ significantly reduces design effort compared to raw VHDL by making the code more readable and reusable. As a case study, we present a hardware LZSS (ZIP) compressor, targeting Xilinx FPGAs that's development was accelerated by using THDL++. We demonstrate how using THDL++ reduced the amount of code lines by a factor of 1.85 compared to VHDL and how using the C++ back-end increased simulation performance by a factor of 8 compared to ModelSim [1]. The THDL++ compiler and an IDE integrated with Xilinx toolchain is available online [2].",

        "Abstract": "We argue that the future of Internet of Things (IoT) systems, especially when it comes to privacy and security, lies in distributed IoT applications. Distributed IoT applications implement a model we call \"computation follows data\". In this model, application modules are deployed directly on IoT devices that produce sensitive data. Developing such applications is, however, not easy. Based on our own experience, we identify the lack of a rapid prototyping and development environment as the biggest challenge in the development process. In this paper, we describe a framework that aims to help simplify the process. The framework provides a web-based user interface with interactive virtual IO ports and a runtime environment for IoT device emulation. We also describe a network architecture with support for WebRTC-based direct device-to-device connections. The network architecture allows experimentation with an entire network of IoT devices, both emulated and physical.",

        "Abstract": "A meteorological data distribution system (MDDS) is presented. The system was implemented in the Spanish Juan Carlos I Antarctic station during the 2002-2003 campaign. Meteorological data are distributed to any point of the base using the LAN, which allows distributing data up to a 3.3-km radius from the acquisition point. The acquisition control procedures are also integrated in the same system. A wide range of difficulties have been overcome during the development of the MDDS, including the integration of heterogeneous components, the integrity of the message system, the future extension and scalability of the system, fault tolerance, process concurrency, and the temporary synchronization of all the applications involved. These have been achieved through three steps, namely 1) design of a complete object-oriented model of the system; 2) implementation of this model using a scalable and portable development environment, such as Java; and 3) use of an intercommunication application technology that fits all the system requirements (high level of abstraction and easy to program and to deploy) as the remote method invocation technology from Java. This development is part of a more ambitious project, called LabVir, that is devoted to implement distributed measurements in Spanish oceanographic vessels and in the Antarctic base using Web technology interfaces. In a more general framework, the LabVir project will make the experimentation tools accessible from any existing navigator, creating a distributed research environment, that is accessible and user friendly from any place with hypertext transfer protocol connectivity",

        "Abstract": "The prevailing binding of SOAP to HTTP specifies that SOAP messages be encoded as an XML 1.0 document which is then sent between client and server. XML processing however can be slow and memory intensive, especially for scientific data, and consequently SOAP has been regarded as an inappropriate protocol for scientific data. Efficiency considerations thus lead to the prevailing practice of separating data from the SOAP control channel. Instead, it is stored in specialized binary formats and transmitted either via attachments or indirectly via a file sharing mechanism, such as GridFTP or HTTP. This separation invariably complicates development due to the multiple libraries and type systems to be handled; furthermore it suffers from performance issues, especially when handling small binary data. As an alternative solution, binary XML provides a highly efficient encoding scheme for binary data in the XML and SOAP messages, and with it we can gain high performance as well as unifying the development environment without unduly impacting the Web service protocol stack. In this paper we present our implementation of a generic SOAP engine that supports both textual XML and binary XML as the encoding scheme of the message. We also present our binary XML data model and encoding scheme. Our experiments show that for scientific applications binary XML together with the generic SOAP implementation not only ease development, but also provide better performance and are more widely applicable than the commonly used separated schemes",

        "Abstract": "This paper contains a framework for the design and development of adaptive Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) to assist educators of all disciplines with configuring and creating adaptive VLEs tailored to their needs. The proposed work is performed in three stages: In the first stage, development of an adaptive VLE that collects learning analytics and enables the educator to parametrize (turn on/off) their collection. The output of these analytics gets stored for further processing. In the second stage, data analysis and processing has been performed for the collected information. In the third stage, the results have been used as an input to adaptive VLE to enable informed personalisation of the student learning path and other adaptations. In this paper, we have proposed the combined use of two different environments for the different stages to achieve the most from their specialisation. For the first and the third stage, the MPS Jetbrains environment for the development of a domain-specific language (DSL) for adaptive VLEs was utilised. This development environment assists the creation of a new DSL that will enable educators to focus on the domain aspects and configure their adaptive VLE implementation to their needs. For the second stage of data analysis, the weka library was used to process the data, apply a range of classification algorithms and produce/store results that can then be used as an input to the adaptive VLE DSL. Overall, the proposed frameworksystem is anticipated to isolate the domain problem from the corresponding implementation details of web development and data analysis and give the adaptive VLE developer a seamless environment to experiment with a very quick turn-around time with ideas in their domain. More automation and integration between the VLE and the data science algorithms utilised for learning analytics data are part of our future plans towards the greater vision of more autonomic and personalised VLEs.",

        "Abstract": "The project Death and Burial Data: Ireland 1864-1922 (DBDIrl) examines the relationship between historical death registration data and burial data to explore the history of power in Ireland from 1864 to 1922. Its core Big Data arises from historical records from a variety of heterogeneous sources, some aspects are pre-digitized and machine readable. A huge data set (over 4 million records in each source) and its slow manual enrichment (ca 7,000 records processed so far) pose issues of quality, scalability, and creates the need for a quality assurance technology that is accessible to non-programmers. An important goal for the researcher community is to produce a reusable, high-level quality assurance tool for the ingested data that is domain specific (historic data), highly portable across data sources, thus independent of storage technology.This paper outlines the step-wise design of the finer granular digital format, aimed for storage and digital archiving, and the design and test of two generations of the techniques, used in the first two data ingestion and cleaning phases.The first small scale phase was exploratory, based on metadata enrichment transcription to Excel, and conducted in parallel with the design of the final digital format and the discovery of all the domain-specific rules and constraints for the syntax and semantic validity of individual entries. Excel embedded quality checks or database-specific techniques are not adequate due to the technology independence requirement. This first phase produced a Java parser with an embedded data cleaning and evaluation classifier, continuously improved and refined as insights grew. The next, larger scale phase uses a bespoke Historian Web Application that embeds the Java validator from the parser, as well as a new Boolean classifier for valid and complete data assurance built using a Model-Driven Development technique that we also describe. This solution enforces property constraints directly at data capture time, removing the need for additional parsing and cleaning stages. The new classifier is built in an easy to use graphical technology, and the ADD-Lib tool it uses is a modern low-code development environment that auto-generates code in a large number of programming languages. It thus meets the technology independence requirement and historians are now able to produce new classifiers themselves without being able to program. We aim to infuse the project with computational and archival thinking in order to produce a robust data set that is FAIR compliant (Free Accessible Inter-operable and Re-useable).",

        "Abstract": "Different investigative methods for proficient energy usage while achieving energy reduction in residential buildings have been or are being undertaken. However, all most attempts have shortcomings, as a result, the grid tends not to meet the load demand effectively and most economically in terms of everchanging anticipated load. This study aims to propose an efficient solution for energy consumption and reduction in residential dwellings. This paper presents a hardware implementation of a smart power consumption monitoring device (a standard/peak load control technique) for household load activities in a laboratory experimental test environment. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the practicality of the developed meter/monitor and its efficacy in terms of its ability to capture/record energy information down individual appliance levels; the remote switching of loads; the remote control of loads (load priority classifications); the meter's ability to set the maximum demand limit; and lastly, the developed smart monitor is expected to provide a remote two-way communication between the utility and the user. In this study part of the circuit was simulated using Proteus Simulation, an online internet communication protocol. While the other part consists of the use of offline mode components. Atmel Studio 7 IDE software was used for the writing of the software code. Furthermore, the design operation performance was carried out using Simulink in MATLAB environment and MATLAB graphics. Three types of loads, namely, resistive, capacitive, and inductive loads were used to test the proposed technique adeptness. The results obtained demonstrated the proficiency of the developed monitoring device, this includes the ability to capture the individual appliance energy information, switch and control loads, and set desired maximum demand limit. Based on the test outcomes, the smart control technique is viable and can contribute towards reducing the strain on the grid while reducing household energy consumption due to improved demand utilization (usage).",

        "Abstract": "The impact of digitization on organizational structures and processes is transforming relationships and work practices. The dynamics of the digital economy fuelled by the high rate of innovation in digital technologies demand that firms adopt an equally rapid and responsive information systems development model/paradigm to keep pace. With reference to Rapid Applications Development (RAD), this case study considers the degree to which an iterative and participative information systems development process is amenable to being conducted in a virtual manner. Using participatory action research, this paper investigates the potential for deploying a virtual learning environment as a CASE tool for the development of web-based applications. In this instance the final IT artefact is an operational prototype - the A/B Dashboard. We demonstrate that a virtual information systems development environment can successfully support a RAD/DSDM approach, resolving some of the existing problems associated with RAD.",

        "Abstract": "Nowadays, computers and modern technologies are available to almost all people. However, we should not forget about disabled or handicapped customers. Those people should have access to a PC as well as to the Internet. This project implements the boundary for people with movement disability. Although, the basic assumption is that they can at least move their heads and eyelids. These parts of the body are monitored by web cameras and with their help the user moves around the virtual keyboard shown on the screen. In this way the user is able to utilize their own PC. Moreover, through winking an eye he/she can virtually press a button and write the required symbol. The whole software for detection system was established in a development environment of the Visual Studio 2010 from Microsoft company. The main advantage of our solution is a cheaper price in compare to any existing solutions. By this fact the solution is possible to use even in third countries like in Africa continent.",

        "Abstract": "The evolution of cluster computers based on multicores, many cores and GPGPU accelerators is encouraging application developers to write hybrid parallel programs. Hybrid parallel programming is quite complex as it requires use of multiple programming paradigms such as MPI, OpenMP, CUDA/OpenCL to exploit the varied computational power available in a system. The paper brings out the challenges faced by application developers desiring to use heterogeneous HPC clusters. It describes a unified development environment which eases the complete development lifecycle of hybrid parallel programs on a HPC cluster. The software is capable of providing access to multiple clusters of different architectures, owing to the modularity of design and web based approach. The paper also serves as a good resource for researchers interested to gain an insight into hybrid parallel programming.",

E-learning technologies have been widely used in private business or school, it usually through a CAI system which has been established completely, then can make learners freely use after classes on the network platform. Web-based learning is a technology-mediated learning that learners acquire knowledge through the information technology environment. Using network learning platform make users enhance their learning ability, and continuously develop resource and improvement, strengthen the learning convenience of users. The purpose of this study based on technology acceptance model is to explore perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness on students' e-learning efficiency. 297 valid responses of undergraduate students in Taiwan universities are our survey subjects. This study uses path analysis to test our hypotheses. The results found that Perceived Ease of Use has an influence on Perceived Usefulness, and Perceived Ease of Use and Perceived Usefulness also have an influence on Learning Satisfaction. All of three hypotheses are supported.",

        "Abstract": "The lack of informal language and software technology standard taxonomy makes it impossible to analyze technology trends on forums and other online sites. Researchers have done an in-depth study of the seven top-notch technology tools and proposed a better automated method to classify software technologies. e.g., Witt uses phrases that describe software tech or concept and put back a wide-ranging class that defines it (i. e., IDE). Furthermore, it defines its function (commercial, PHP). By extension, this method can dynamically compile the list using all technologies of a given type. In a same way working of WordNet, WebIsADb, WiBiTaxonomy, and few other tools is also studied by the researchers. Eventually, they compared these classification methodologies and establish that Witt, once used in software jargon, showed healthier results as compared to all other explanations assessed, lacking a conforming diminution in untrue alarm rates.",

        "Abstract": "Software engineering is extremely information-intensive. Every day developers work with source code, version repositories, issue trackers, documentation, web-based and other information resources. However, three key aspects of information work lack good support: (i) combining information from different sources; (ii) flexibly presenting collected information to enable easier comprehension; and (iii) automatically acting on collected information, for example to perform a refactoring. Poor support for these activities makes many common development tasks time-consuming and error-prone. We propose an approach that directly addresses these three issues by integrating a flexible query mechanism into the development environment. Our approach enables diverse ways to process and visualize information and can be extended via scripts. We demonstrate how an implementation of the approach can be used to rapidly write queries that meet a wide range of information needs.",

        "Abstract": "As global networks are being used by more and more people, they are becoming increasingly interesting for commercial applications. The success and change in direction of the World-Wide Web is a clear indication for this. However this success met a largely unprepared communications infrastructure. The Internet as an originally non-profit network did neither offer the security, nor the globally available accounting infrastructure by itself. These problems were addressed in the recent past, but in a seemingly ad-hoc manner. Several different accounting schemes sensible for only certain types of commercial transactions have been developed, which either seem to neglect the problems of scalability, or trade security for efficiency. Finally, some proposals aim at achieving near perfect security at the expense of efficiency, thus rendering those systems to be of no practical use. In contrast, this paper presents a suitably configurable scheme for accounting in a general, widely distributed client/server environment. When developing the protocol, special attention has been paid to make this approach work well in the future setting of high-bandwidth, high-latency internets. The developed protocol has been applied to a large-scale distributed application, a WWW-based software development environment.",

This is particularly true and even necessary in a collaborative testing environment which requires greater communication between testers and developers. In this work we introduce a collaborative visual state-based testing methodology for applications developed in Ruby on Rails, a representative of the Workflow and MVC-based web applications development environment. Our methodology permits, in real time, two or more software testers to share, review, and comment on state-based test results of workflows under test. Collaborators can also examine test cases, edit them and initiate testing sessions. In the paper we describe the design of our collaborative testing methodology.",

In a serverless computing environment, services are developed as service functional units. The function development environment of all serverless computing framework at present is CPU based. In this paper, we propose a GPU-supported serverless computing framework that can deploy services faster than existing serverless computing framework using CPU. Our core approach is to integrate the open source serverless computing framework with NVIDIA-Docker and deploy services based on the GPU support container. We have developed an API that connects the open source framework to the NVIDIA-Docker and commands that enable GPU programming. In our experiments, we measured the performance of the framework in various environments. As a result, developers who want to develop services through the framework can deploy high-performance micro services and developers who want to run deep learning programs without a GPU environment can run code on remote GPUs with little performance degradation.",

        "Abstract": "Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications have been challenged by vast emerging security threats. The increasing number of connected devices on an IoT network may encounter potential attacks while relaying messages over the public Internet. Security methods in traditional wireless networks are often specific to single architectures and are therefore ineffective in solving security issues that may surface on hybrid IoT networks. In this paper, we propose a software defined end-edge-cloud network architecture for smart IoT applications. We apply a deep-learning (DL) based intrusion detection system (IDS) to secure this architecture. We implement this system based on the Caffe framework and train several popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) including LeNet, AlexNet, and ResNet-50. We evaluate the performance of this system in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We then investigate the FPGA-based acceleration technique to reduce the training and runtime of CNNs. We implement the FPGA acceleration based on a Xilinx KU115 board which achieves efficient performance per watt while training and deploying the IDS. For accelerating CNNs on the FPGA, we investigate a Winograd convolution engine in the Xilinx SDAccel development environment which offers automation schemes for accelerating computations. Our preliminary study may provide some insights into the experimental support for advancing IoT research and development for securing various smart applications.",

Until recently, the majority of work in the IoT area focused on data acquisition, analytics and visualization. However, we believe that the evolution towards IoT will eventually result in the creation of a Programmable World in which even the simplest things and most ordinary artifacts are connected to public or private clouds and can be controlled and programmed remotely. In this paper we will introduce Kiuas -- a cloud-based IoT development environment for enabling the Programmable World.

        "Abstract": "With the proliferation of low-cost sensors and the Internet-of-Things (IoT), the rate of producing data far exceeds the compute and storage capabilities of today's infrastructure. Much of this data takes the form of time series, and in response, there has been increasing interest in the creation of time series archives in the last decade, along with the development and deployment of novel analysis methods to process the data. The general strategy has been to apply a plurality of similarity search mechanisms to various subsets and subsequences of time series data in order to identify repeated patterns and anomalies; however, the computational demands of these approaches renders them incompatible with today's power-constrained embedded CPUs.To address this challenge, we present FA-LAMP, an FPGA-accelerated implementation of the Learned Approximate Matrix Profile (LAMP) algorithm, which predicts the correlation between streaming data sampled in real-time and a representative time series dataset used for training. FA-LAMP lends itself as a real-time solution for time series analysis problems such as classification and anomaly detection, among others. FA-LAMP provides a mechanism to integrate accelerated computation as close as possible to IoT sensors, thereby eliminating the need to transmit and store data in the cloud for posterior analysis.At its core, LAMP and FA-LAMP employ Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) to perform prediction. This work investigates the challenges and limitations of deploying CNNs on FPGAs when using state-of-the-art commercially-supported frameworks built for this purpose, namely, the Xilinx Deep Learning Processor Unit (DPU) overlay and the Vitis AI development environment. This work exposes several technical limitations of the DPU, while providing a mechanism to overcome these limits by attaching our own hand-optimized IP block accelerators to the DPU overlay. We evaluate FA-LAMP using a low-cost Xilinx Ultra96-V2 FPGA, demonstrating performance and energy improvements of more than an order of magnitude compared to a prototypical LAMP deployment running on a Raspberry Pi 3. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/fccm2021sub/fccm-lamp.",

        "Abstract": "Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT) is increasingly relying on over-the-air firmware updates (FOTA) to deliver tailored analytics to control systems for critical infrastructure. Connected IIOT with FOTA can deliver significant value by decreasing capital investments, enabling customizable functionalities, or improving operational efficiencies. FOTA also increases exposure to threats targeting critical infrastructure, which could lead to safety or mission damage (i.e., failures could result in loss of life or loss of critical functions). This paper presents a security baseline for FOTA by creating a secure “pipeline” for IIOT firmware. It first provides a generic reference architecture that defines connections between the IIOT device, a gateway for communication outside the control network, cloud storage and configuration logic, and the device-vendor's development environment. It describes attacks against various aspects of the reference architecture and explains the security controls that the device-vendor should implement to ensure that the benefits of FOTA for continuous upgradable security and efficiency outweigh the risks from additional exposure. It also provides some follow-on recommendations that utilities should consider before installing IIOT with FOTA capabilities, including: securing the device with secure boot and chain of trust, securing all communication channels with unique endpoint identification and encryption, taking the human out of the build and update processes, and hardening components involved in FOTA for continuous monitoring. This paper emphasizes that these types of connected devices promote a need for a shared responsibility model of cybersecurity.",

        "Abstract": "5G is expected to account for a large portion of the global mobile industry over the following years. The media vertical sector is expected to be one of the leading adopters of 5G technology, due to its 100x faster gigabit-per-second speeds, ultra-low latencies and higher-reliability compared to 4G connectivity, as media mobile app developers can truly push the boundaries on features and functionality in any novel mobile application. However, 5G networks present challenges (such as security and privacy issues, setup of viable 5G-based mobile app business models, testing and verification issues) to media application developers. To address the above needs and challenges 5GMediaHUB aims to build and operate an elastic, secure, trusted, all-in-one, multi-tenant service execution and NetApps development environment based on an open cloud-based architecture and APIs, by developing and integrating a testing and validation system with existing well-established 5G testbeds, for enabling the fast prototyping, testing and validation of novel 5G media services and NetApps, thus reducing the entry barrier to 3rd party media application testers (from SMEs, service providers, researchers, etc.).",

Within this context, an interesting approach that can foster IoT applications’ development is extending the serverless paradigm towards the network edge to cover IoT environments: a paradigm that we refer to as ‘deviceless’. In this approach, an IoT infrastructure composed of devices deployed at the network edge can seamlessly be integrated as an application execution infrastructure to enable interactions with hosted sensors/actuators. This paper discusses several perspectives available in the literature on the (IoT) edge-based serverless paradigm and related use cases in an IoT/edge computing context. Besides, we present our preliminary prototype for implementing the deviceless approach to show its viability. We exploit the deviceless paradigm to conceive data pipelines under a flow-based development environment leveraging a geographically distributed IoT infrastructure.",

        "Abstract": "5G network technology can offer major benefits to the Media & Entertainment (M&E) sector in addressing the challenges associated with production and delivery of mobile, IP-driven media services, such as smart media production, 4K/8k video streaming, and live virtual reality. The massive growth in demand for such advanced services has created the need for innovative experimentation facilities. These can support the M&E industry in continually enhancing user experience and creating efficiencies in how content is produced and delivered across mobile networks. Such support is the core goal of the H2020-funded 5GMediaHUB project, which aims to accelerate the testing and validation of innovative 5G-enabled media applications and Network Applications, through an open, integrated and fully featured experimentation facility. This will significantly reduce the service creation lifecycle and minimise time-to-market, thus enhancing the competitiveness of facility users. 5GMediaHUB will create an elastic, secure and trusted multi-tenant service execution and Network Application development environment, based on an open, cloud-based architecture and APIs. The project will integrate this testing and validation system with two well-established 5G testbeds at CTTC, Spain and Telenor, Norway. In this article, we first introduce the key features of the 5GMediaHUB experimentation facility. These features ensure effective operation of advanced media applications over 5G, and support developers in minimising application performance uncertainties prior to widescale commercial deployment. Next, the deployment and implementation of the 5GMediaHUB infrastructure is presented, before the deployment and validation of the project’s use cases are discussed. These use cases will explore the topics of Interactive Media, Content Creation and Media Distribution, all enabled through advanced 5G connectivity.",

We propose a simple optoelectronic tweezer platform, which can be controlled remotely and simply for the manipulation of microparticles at different scales, based on the novel manipulation technique called optically-induced dielectrophoresis. In this work, we design and set up the optoelectronic tweezer manipulation platform and develop the full-function human-computer interactive control interface and graphics rendering system to simplify the micro-operation process. Using Qt5.0 development environment, an experimental image processing system with multi-thread characteristics is developed, and the information interaction requirements needed in the experimental operation of optoelectronic tweezers are integrated into a control system to achieve unified information management and data analysis. Combined with cloud computing technology, the system realizes local/remote synchronous linkage operation, with cross-platform operation capability of various portable operating terminals like laptop and iPad.",

        "Abstract": "As the scale and complexity of cloud systems are increasing, system faults are becoming unavoidable. Therefore, they should be detected as reliably and accurately as possible. Black-box monitoring can reliably monitor a target system from a remote host, but it is often coarse-grained and cannot identify the root causes of system faults. In contrast, white-box monitoring can accurately obtain fault information inside a target system, but it is largely affected by system faults. This paper proposes GPUSentinel for more reliable white-box monitoring using general-purpose GPUs. GPUSentinel runs fault detectors in an isolated GPU, which is not easily affected by faults of a target system. For accurate detection, fault detectors in a GPU analyze main memory and directly monitor the state of the operating system. To easily develop such fault detectors, GPUSentinel provides a development environment with LLVM. We have implemented GPUSentinel and seven fault detectors and then confirmed that GPUSentinel could detect various system faults and identify the root causes.",

        "Abstract": "This chapter covers the key objectives of Professional Cloud Architect Certification exam: designing for security and designing for security legal compliance. The Identity and Access Management (IAM) service is designed to allow you to specify what operations specific users can perform on particular resources. This is also described as specifying “who gets to do what on which resources.” IAM is the recommended way to control access in most cases. In some limited cases, such as in a development environment, the older primitive roles system may be used. An identity is an entity that represents a person or other agent that performs actions on a GCP resource. Identities are sometimes called members. Google accounts are used by people and represent people who interact with GCP, such as developers and administrators. These accounts are designated by an email address that is linked to a Google account. For example, jane.doe@gmail.com could be an identity in GCP. The domain of the email does not have to be gmail.com; it just has to be associated with a Google account. Service accounts are used by applications running in GCP. These are used to give applications their own set of access controls instead of relying on using a person's account for permissions. Service accounts are also designated by email addresses.",

        "Abstract": "Today's competitive software industry, firms must improve their quality while lowering production costs. Increasing productivity is the most effective strategy to reduce expenses in software development. In the meantime, there are some restrictions in software development to increase productivity, such as the complexity and replication of source code, difficulty to share source code, ineffective communication, and other resource constraints. Therefore, cloud computing and SaaS can help in increasing the productivity of software development efficiently and effectively. The literature study identified 19 factors influencing productivities. We later group these factors into three main factors; process, development environment, and product or services that help maintain a good and improve software development performance. This paper aims to report the validation process results of identified productivity factors using an expert review approach. The expert review process consists of two steps; identify the expert and conduct the evaluation process. Consequently, the experts agree on three main factors with 17 sub-factors. This study contributes to enhancing software development productivity and increasing the company's performance as the Software Development Productivity Model emphasizes the engagement platform. Further research should be conducted to improve software developer satisfaction levels, as achieving satisfaction will interpret the level of comfort and acceptability toward SaaS usage.",

        "Abstract": "GIS techniques are becoming the mainstream tool in different disciplines such as assessments of biomass resources, mineral resource analysis, groundwater, and air quality investigation. This study explored its application in solving environmental problems monitoring and risk assessment. GIS application in environmental monitoring has mainly been divided into three aspects: water, soil, and atmosphere. Based on ArcGIS 10.1 software and ArcGIS 9.3.1 version, GIS has been applied in water supply system monitoring and soil heavy metal concentration monitoring, respectively. In addition, it can achieve real-time geographic location information transmission accurately and monitor in various fields by combining the Alibaba Cloud elastic computing service server, user management development environment, real-time data display, wireless sensor network, Arduino microcontroller, and a series of sensors. Combined with the Radial Basis Function Network model and spatial data, GIS technology could monitor and assess the degree of soil wind erosion hazard by quantifying the various indicators of soil wind erosion. GIS can also be applied to assess the environmental risks from water, land, and atmosphere. Based on geological and geomorphological data, the integration of remote sensing and GIS can complete the assessment of flash flood disasters, groundwater exploration, and groundwater pollution. By using the spatial analysis and data processing capabilities of GIS and combined with other technologies or methods such as digital elevation model and Pollution Index, topographic changes, soil properties, and heavy metal pollution can be assessed. GIS provides the ability to query spatial data and translates existing spatial patterns into measurable targets with its built-in analytical tools. It can be used to predict and assess air quality prediction. Through these approaches, relevant authorities can manage different areas rationally and targeted manner, which has practical and long-term implications.",

        "Abstract": "Researchers are currently drawn to study projects hosted on GitHub due to its popularity, ease of obtaining data, and its distinctive built-in social features. GitHub has been found to create a transparent development environment, which together with a pull request-based workflow, provides a lightweight mechanism for committing, reviewing and managing code changes. These features impact how GitHub is used and the benefits it provides to teams' development and collaboration. While most of the evidence we have is from GitHub's use in open source software (OSS) projects, GitHub is also used in an increasing number of commercial projects. It is unknown how GitHub supports these projects given that GitHub's workflow model does not intuitively fit the commercial development way of working. In this paper, we report findings from an online survey and interviews with GitHub users on how GitHub is used for collaboration in commercial projects. We found that many commercial projects adopted practices that are more typical of OSS projects including reduced communication, more independent work, and self-organization. We discuss how GitHub's transparency and popular workflow can promote open collaboration, allowing organizations to increase code reuse and promote knowledge sharing across their teams.",

        "Abstract": "Developer emotion or sentiment in a software development environment has the potential to affect performance, and consequently, the software itself. Sentiment analysis, conducted to analyze online collaborative artifacts, can derive effects of developer sentiment. This study aims to understand how developer sentiment is related to bugs, by analyzing the difference of sentiment between regular and Fix-Inducing Changes (FIC) - changes to code that introduce bugs in the system. To do so, sentiment is extracted from Pull Requests of 6 well known GitHub repositories, which contain both code and contributor discussion. Sentiment is calculated using a tool specializing in the software engineering domain: SentiStrength-SE. Next, FICs are detected from Commits by filtering the ones that fix bugs and tracking the origin of the code these remove. Commits are categorized based on FICs and assigned separate sentiment scores (-4 to +4) based on different preceding artifacts - Commits, Comments and Reviews from Pull Requests. The statistical result shows that FICs, compared to regular Commits, contain more positive Comments and Reviews. Commits that precede an FIC have more negative messages. Similarly, all the Pull Request artifacts combined are more negative for FICs than regular Commits.",

The approach adapts the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) and defines a specialized language profile, the SysML-AT, to support automated code generation for IEC 61131-3 runtime environments. For adapted SysML Parametric Diagrams (PD), a prototypical tool support was realized inside a commonly used automation software development environment. Inside the prototypical tool, the linking between the realized PD model editor and online data from the IEC 61131-3 runtime environment enables direct debugging within a SysML-AT model. The concept was evaluated by case studies and by usability experiments, which proved the usability of the SysML-based MDE approach for future users.",

        "Abstract": "This article contains the design and development of an Adaptive Virtual Learning Environment (AdaptiveVLE) framework to assist educators of all disciplines with creating adaptive VLEs tailored to their needs and to contribute towards the creation of a more generic framework for adaptive systems. Fully online education is a major trend in education technology of our times. However, it has been criticised for its lack of personalisation and therefore not adequately addressing individual students' needs. Adaptivity and intelligence are elements that could substantially improve the student experience and enhance the learning taking place. There are several attempts in academia and in industry to provide adaptive VLEs and therefore personalise educational provision. All these attempts require a multiple-domain (multi-disciplinary) approach from education professionals, software developers, data scientists to cover all aspects of the system. An integrated environment that can be used by all the multiple-domain users mentioned above and will allow for quick experimentation of different approaches is currently missing. Specifically, a transparent approach that will enable the educator to configure the data collected and the way it is processed without any knowledge of software development and/or data science algorithms implementation details is required. In our proposed work, we developed a new language/framework using MPS JetBrains Domain-Specific Language (DSL) development environment to address this problem. Our work consists of the following stages: data collection configuration by the educator, implementation of the adaptive VLE, data processing, adaptation of the learning path. These stages correspond to the adaptivity stages of all adaptive systems such as monitoring, processing and adaptation. The extension of our framework to include other application areas such as business analytics, health analytics, etc. so that it becomes a generic framework for adaptive systems as well as more usability testing for all applications will be part of our future work.",

        "Abstract": "Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) development approaches tend to start from the physical (hardware) perspective, and the software is the final element in the process. However, this approach is unfit for the more software-intensive world that is increasingly iterative, connected, and constantly online. Many constraints prevent the application of iterative, incremental, and agile development methodologies, which now are the norm for many other fields of software. Time-consuming system validation can only start when both hardware and software components are ready, which implies that the software delivery and quality is almost always the final bottleneck in the CPS development and integration. Also organizational issues raise concerns - CPS development teams are nowadays often geographically distributed, which can result in delays in the process, shortcomings, and even mistakes. In this paper, we propose using our envisioned open-source Virtual Reality-based Integrated software Development Environment (VRIDE) for developing the next generation, increasingly software-intensive CPSs in efficient ways.",

All lab offers such courses to both DHI and non-DHI communities. Still, DHI graduates legs behind non-DHI in debugging-related tasks when the industry-standard Eclipse (Development Environment) is used [1]. Visual debuggers improve DHI performance [2]. In this paper, we present Java Accessible Visual Debugger (JAD). JAD was conceived to be the first accessible visual debugger and to leverage debugging performance between DHI and non-DHI. This paper presents a study involving DHI/non-DHI and JAD. Three metrics were used to assess performance: 1) number of fully completed tasks (TFC); 2) time to task completion (TCT); 3) number of external help requests (HR). Non-paired t-Student's tests show no significant difference in any of the above criteria.",

        "Abstract": "Various fault detection methods, particularly focused on onboard Condition-Based Monitoring (CBM) in Electrical Machines and Drives (EMDs), face limitations such as sensitivity to load variations, slow fault detection, and the absence of fully automated solutions. AI and Data-Driven methods offer flexible alternatives, utilizing historical data for pattern and anomaly identification. Among Electrical Signature Analysis techniques for electrical motor diagnostics, the Space Vector Theory (SVT) is extensively used, while Park’s Vector based diagnostic solutions lack real-time Inter-Turn Short Circuit (ITSC) fault severity assessment, with available techniques often limited to binary classifiers. Implementing AI with SVT for real-time Electric Vehicle (EV) use is underdeveloped, hindered by data scarcity and diverse dataset collection challenges. Real-time simulation, accurate fault modeling, and hardware limitations pose challenges, especially for embedding AI models into processors. To achieve intelligent onboard diagnosis for ITSC fault severity in this paper, a multi-modal approach model is proposed, employing MobileNetV2 to classify Park’s Vector trajectories based on the fault features related to the number of shorted turns. Performance assessments encompass both the standard MobileNetV2 and the proposed multi-modal approach model across various fault severity levels. Furthermore, to address the challenge of limited data availability, an accelerated real-time AI development environment is designed using an FPGA to generate synthetic fault pattern datasets, aligning with the standards of the Electric Vehicle industry. For modeling PMSM with ITSC faults, a fault circuit model is employed. The dataset of 900 Park’s Vector trajectory images is automatically generated by varying the torque request from 10 to 100 Nm with a 10 Nm resolution. At each torque operating point, the motor currents are recorded by adjusting the number of shorted turns. Simulation results confirm the outstanding performance of MobileNetV2 in binary classification, achieving an accuracy of 99.26 %. In case of 5-class ITSC fault severity classification, the prediction accuracy reaches only 72.55 %. The here proposed multi-modal MobileNetV2 model excels, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 99.163 % in the 3-class fault severity classification and 84.907 % in the 5-class classification. These results support the superiority of the proposed multi-modal MobileNetV2 model, which is trained on the generated rich dataset. It outperforms existing Park’s Vector Analysis based ITSC fault detection methods, particularly in early ITSC fault detection as it can detect faults from 6 shorted turns. Additionally, it allows for online fault severity assessment during transient operation and meets stringent requirements for onboard applications. Altogether, the results of investigations prove the presence and extractability of fine detail information in Park’s Vector trajectories, for assessing ITSC fault severity. This contributes to a deeper understanding and analysis of faults in electrical motors through the use of Park’s Vector trajectories.",

In practice, the experiment reported includes an introduction of Telecom Design Environment (TDE) and customisation of it for the local needs of NMP/SP at the Jyvaskyla site. TDE is a Nokia in-house tool, which provides multi-user modelling capabilities and integrates both process modelling and production support. The TDE customisation discussed in the paper is focused in the development of process templates and associated online guidance. The effect of TDE adoption is evaluated against the current process support as well as against the feedback received from software designers participating in customisation.",

        "Abstract": "With the growing number of programmable processing elements in today's Multiprocessor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) designs, the synergy required for the development of the hardware architecture and the software running on them is also increasing. In MPSoC development environment, changes in the hardware architecture can bring in extensive re-partitioning or re-parallelization of the software architecture. Fast and accurate functional simulation and performance estimation techniques are needed to cope with this co-design problem at the early phases of MPSoC design space exploration. The current paper addresses this issue by introducing a framework which combines hybrid simulation, cache simulation and online trace-driven replay techniques to accurately predict performance of programmable elements in an MPSoC environment. The resulting simulation technique can easily cope with the continuous re-organizations of software architectures during an Instruction Set Simulator (ISS) based design process. Experimental results show that this framework can improve system simulation speed by 3-5X on average while achieving accuracy closely comparable to traditional ISSes.",

        "Abstract": "Recent years have seen widespread application of machine learning (ML) to a diverse range of industries and problem domains. By taking advantage of the availability of massive amounts of data and scalable compute resources, ML methods are able to outperform traditional hand-tuned models on today’s wide-range of AI tasks, particularly in the settings of server computing and/or cloud computing. However, the success of ML in sensing applications such as object detection and speech recognition has also driven a demand for such technology (both training and inference) in edge settings, for applications such as autonomous vehicles, mobile devices, and embedded/Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Unfortunately, most existing ML models, hardware, and frameworks are tailored toward the server and/or cloud computing environments and are ill-equipped for edge computing. State- of-the-art ML systems in industry today already use custom frameworks, algorithms, and hardware built for a server infrastructure. Addressing the unique challenges of ML at the edge will similarly require specialization, codesign, and integration of domain knowledge for the edge across the computing stack. This timely special issue IEEE Design&Test of called for novel research on ML models, hardware architectures, programming tools, and design methodologies for ML at the edge.",

        "Abstract": "The lack of informal language and software technology standard taxonomy makes it impossible to analyze technology trends on forums and other online sites. Researchers have done an in-depth study of the seven top-notch technology tools and proposed a better automated method to classify software technologies. e.g., Witt uses phrases that describe software tech or concept and put back a wide-ranging class that defines it (i. e., IDE). Furthermore, it defines its function (commercial, PHP). By extension, this method can dynamically compile the list using all technologies of a given type. In a same way working of WordNet, WebIsADb, WiBiTaxonomy, and few other tools is also studied by the researchers. Eventually, they compared these classification methodologies and establish that Witt, once used in software jargon, showed healthier results as compared to all other explanations assessed, lacking a conforming diminution in untrue alarm rates.",

        "Abstract": "Service-oriented computing and service-level orchestration through visual or graphical programming have been widely used in software and particularly in Web application development. Their further developments and fusing into Internet of Things, Robot as a Service (RaaS), cloud computing, and big data analysis have created the infrastructure for the information technologies to penetrate into all sectors of industry, service, and society. Figure 1 shows the stack of the related concepts, technologies, and applications. IoT service orchestration and visual programming separates the high-level composition from the low-level device programming, which allows the application builders to focus on the business logic, while the service providers to focus on efficient service development. This presentation will discuss the current service orchestration and visual programming environments for IoT application development. The presentation centralizes the topics around IoT. It starts with the upper layer of IoT, including service-oriented computing, Web software development, and service orchestration for system integration, which forms the foundation of cloud computing and a major data source of big data analysis. On the other hand, IoT standards and protocols are presented, which connect the service orchestration infrastructure tohardware and devices. As IoT applications and implementations, ADS (Autonomous Decentralized Systems), DPWS (Device Profile for Web Services), and Robot as a Service will be discussed. Different orchestration environments that have been widely used in industry and academic world will be presented, including BPEL in Oracle SOA Suite, Microsoft Workflow Foundation, Intel IoT Service Orchestration Layer, Microsoft Robotics Development Studio, MIT App Inventor, CMU Alice visual game programming environment, and ASU VIPLE (Visual IoT/Robotics Programming Environment). As a case study, VIPLE will be presented in more detail. VIPLE is a free software with open source IoT middleware developed at Arizona State University. VIPLE orchestration environment has an open interface to IoT devices. Any IoT device that can be programmed to interpret JSON objects and wrap sensory data into JSON objects can interface with VIPLE and be programmed using VIPLE orchestration environment. A demonstration will be given to show how an IoT application can be developed in minutes to control Intel Edison IoT device. VIPLE software, including orchestration environment, IoT middleware, full document, and lecture slides can be downloaded at: http://venus.eas.asu.edu/WSRepository/VIPLE.",

        "Abstract": "Proponents have long touted the impending popularity of 3D technology on the Web. The Intel-led 3DIF developed the universal 3D file-format specification as a way to make CAD data usable on multiple platforms. The 3DIF is a cross-industry group of about 40 developers and corporate users of 3D graphics technology. Proponents hope U3D will let developers incorporate 3D CAD data into various applications, such as Web browsers, thereby making 3D use more widespread. This would also increase demand for 3D development tools and faster CPUs and graphics chips. Intel and the 3DIF are working with Ecma International, an industry-based standards-development organization. They ultimately hope to make U3D an ISO (International Organization for Standardization) standard.",
