Recently, with the release of Libra blockchain from Facebook, the decentralized finance concepts have another huge development. However, there are already many different blockchain systems existing now and the development of blockchain systems have become more and more complicated since each kind of blockchain development environment will consume time to be built. To make the programming on different blockchain systems more easily, we propose a novel cloud-based solution, namely ChainIDE, for the development of blockchain-based smart contracts on multiple kinds of blockchain systems. With chainIDE, cross-chain developing of smart contracts on different blockchain systems can be easily done without any time consumed by building the environment. Based on the operation statistics in this paper, we served more than 310,000 compilations in the past 30 days which makes us the most popular cloud-based cross-chain development platform in the world.","2330-2186","978-1-7281-5011-6","10.1109/CloudCom.2019.00055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8968849","Blockchain;Smart Contract;Cross-chain Platform;Libra;Cloud IDE","","","8","","14","IEEE","28 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to simplify the programming environment and improve the convenience, a Matlab programming environment based on Web is proposed in this paper. Compared with the traditional Matlab programming environment, the main features of the system are that it does not need to deploy any development environment locally, and users can write and run Matlab code through the browser of mobile phone, tablet, computer; at the same time, the system also supports standard input, parameter input, and image output.

The increasing need for remote work and collaborative workspaces have led to the IDE-as-a-service paradigm that offers online code editing and compilation with multiple language support. In this paper, we show that a multitude of online IDEs do not run control checks on the user code and can be therefore lever-aged by a botnet. We examine the concept of uncontrolled execution environments and present a proof of concept to show how uncontrolled online-IDEs can be weaponized to perform large-scale attacks by a botnet.

This paper presents a lightweight IDE named CodeHelper integrated with an online judge that allows the instructor or the teaching assistant (TA) to help students in a form of online pair programming. Students can share their code with the instructor or the TA in a sandbox programming environment generated by CodeHelper, and the instructor or the TA can guide students by marking the mistakes in the sandbox. CodeHelper allows real-time pair programming for both sides, which can reduce the time and the cost of distance learning. Besides, the source code shared in the sandbox can also be compiled for syntax check, executed with a user-defined input, and submitted to the online judge for automated assessment, which can let students check the correctness of their programs once their troubles have been solved. It is efficient to use CodeHelper for mentoring students in online programming courses.","","978-1-7281-7618-5","10.1109/ICCCI51764.2021.9486772","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9486772","Online programming courses;e-mentoring;pair programming","COVID-19;Pandemics;Education;Syntactics;User experience;Real-time systems;Internet","","1","","11","IEEE","27 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While it is a natural abstraction for applications that interface with the physical world, the disadvantage is that the control flow of a program is hidden in the maze of event handlers and call-back functions. TinyOS is a representative event-driven operating system, designed for wireless sensor networks, featuring a component-based architecture that promotes code reuse. In this paper, we present a web-based model-driven graphical design environment for TinyOS that visualizes the component hierarchy of an application, and captures its event-based scheduling mechanism. In contrast with existing visual environments, our representation explicitly captures the control flow of the application through events and commands, which makes it easier to understand the program logic than studying the source code. The design environment supports two-way code generation: mapping the visual representation to TinyOS source code, as well as building visual models from existing sources.","1558-058X","978-1-5090-2246-5","10.1109/SECON.2016.7506646","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7506646","","Visualization;Operating systems;Instruction sets;Programming;Computational modeling;Context","","2","","10","IEEE","9 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It uses the text-based TGRL (Textual Goal-oriented Requirement Language) to build URN goal models and then automatically generates corresponding graphical models. This framework is based on the architecture of Eclipse Che and Theia. On one side, Theia provides support for LSP (Language Server Protocol) so that textual models can be built and their corresponding graphical models can be generated in a browser IDE (Integrated Development Environment). On the other hand, Eclipse Che adds support for collaboration where multiple modellers can contribute to building the textual models in an online collaborative manner. This initiative aims to replace the jUCMNAV tool, which is the most comprehensive URN modelling tool to date but only supports a single user.","2575-4475","978-1-7281-2231-1","10.1109/MiSE.2019.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8877072","User Requirements Notation, URN, jUCMNav, Eclipse Che, Theia, Sprotty, LSP, ELK, TURN, TGRL","Collaboration;Servers;Tools;Visualization;Protocols;Buildings;Computational modeling","","5","","17","IEEE","21 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several domain-specific languages have been drafted for domains such as industrial automation systems, based on IEC 61499, and biological knowledge structuring, to evaluate the proposed architecture. The results indicate the viability of integrating such an approach in future web-based development environments, thereby enhancing the ease and efficiency of conducting code analysis and editing tasks.

Students must be provided with adequate tools for developing an understanding of computer science paradigms. These paradigms include object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. JavelinaCode is a web-based integrated development environment (IDE) for Java programming that provides students with both a static and dynamic visualization of code; the static structure of code at compile time and the dynamic execution of code at run time. The objective of this research is to present the differences between JavelinaCode and similar programming environment tools to demonstrate how JavelinaCode improves students' understanding of OOP concepts. Comparative analysis is conducted between JavelinaCode and programming environment tools, including BlueJ, Jeliot 3, AguiaJ, JIVE, and jGRASP. Each of these tools is evaluated on the basis of time constraints for download and installation, complexity of the download process and tool's interface, and the provision of static and dynamic visualizations. The results of the comparative analysis show that JavelinaCode provides students with a more effective tool for understanding OOP concepts than those considered. This is due to a simplified set up process and user interface and a better integrated set of visualizations. The combination of these factors contributes to a programming environment that emphasizes developing and running code.","","978-1-5090-1790-4","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757639","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757639","object-oriented programming;static visualization;dynamic visualization;programming education;web-based programming environment","Visualization;Programming environments;Linux;Programming profession;Dynamic programming;Unified modeling language","","4","1","13","IEEE","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a framework allowing to generate event logs from cloud-based IDE. These event logs are then examined using a process mining technique to extract the developers' coding processes and compare them in the shared coding environment. The approach can be used to discover emergent and interesting developers' behavior. Thus, we compare the coding process extracted by developers with different skills. To validate our approach, we describe the results of a study in which we investigate the coding activities of forty students of an advanced Java programming course performing a given programming task-during four assignments.

Nevertheless, the difficulties found when trying to install the computer programming environment used in the university courses prevent many students from practicing at home. Hence, they can only practice during the computer laboratory lessons, or when the laboratories are available for the students. This limitation negatively affects the learning process. In order to reduce this obstacle, we have replaced the conventional IDE used in our courses by a web-based IDE called Codeboard. Among other advantages, this environment has the ability to collect statistics about the number of accesses to the developed projects, the number of compilations and runs of the corresponding programs, and the number of global accesses per day. Thus, it enables teachers to monitor the activities of the students both in lectures and at home. After using this tool for a semester, in this paper we report the statistics that are collected when using Codeboard, the limitations we have found in this tool, and how they could be easily overcome in order to perform a better analysis. We also report on the results of this preliminary experience by comparing the results of three consecutive courses (taught by the same instructors and using the same materials) in order to evaluate the influence of Codeboard on the learning process.","","978-1-5386-3968-9","10.1109/ITHET.2017.8067822","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8067822","","Programming;Tools;Programming environments;Computer languages;Analysis of variance;Electronic mail;Monitoring","","1","","6","IEEE","16 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Learning to program is another activity that can be implemented in a more collaborative way, students can learn in an active style by working with others. The growth of online classes, from small structured seminars to massive open online courses (MOOCs), and the isolation and impoverished learning experience some students report in these, points to an urgent need for tools that support remote pair programming in a distributed educational setting.

We conducted a lab study in which participants completed a programming task involving the use of the Java Swing/AWT API. We found that information about participant web accesses offered additional insight into the types of difficulties faced and how they could be detected. Difficulties that were not completely solved through web searches involved finding information on AWT/Swing tutorials, 2-D Graphics, Components, and Events, with 2-D Graphics causing the most problems. An existing algorithm to predict difficulty that mined various aspects of programming-environment actions detected more difficulties when it used an additional feature derived from the times when web pages were visited. This result is consistent with our observation that during certain difficulties, subjects had little interaction with the programming environment, they made more web visits during difficulty periods, and the new feature added information not available from features of the modified existing algorithm. The vast majority of difficulties, however, involved no web interaction and the new feature resulted in higher number of false positives, which is consistent with the high variance in web accesses during both non-difficulty and difficulty periods.","1943-6106","978-1-5386-4235-1","10.1109/VLHCC.2018.8506511","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8506511","interactive programming environments;affective computing;distributed help;web foraging;intelligent tutoring","Task analysis;Programming;Web search;Prediction algorithms;Java;Web pages;Programming environments","","1","","16","IEEE","25 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To verify the robustness of object detection models by testing, large amounts of diversifted annotated LiDAR point clouds are required to be used as test data. However, considering the sparseness of objects, the diversity of the existing point cloud dataset is limited by the number and types of objects. Therefore, it is important to generate diversifted point clouds by test data augmentation. In this paper, we propose a tool for LiDAR point cloud via test data augmentation, named TauLiM. A well-designed metamorphic relation (MR) [1] is proposed to augment point clouds while maintaining their physical characteristic of LiDAR. TauLiM is composed of three modules, namely point cloud configuration, coordinate filtering, and object insertion. To evaluate our tool, we employ experiments to compare the ability of testing between the existing dataset and the augmented one. The result shows that TauLiM can effectively augment diversified test data and test the object detection model.

It should be performed at the earliest stages of the software development life cycle, the goal being to minimize risk, regardless of the progress of various vulnerability detection techniques in program code, both static and with deep learning, website application developers need to be assisted with notifications in real time, not waiting for the entire project to be completed directly from the IDE they use to stay focused. A common problem with vulnerability detection tools is annoying false-positive results and a lack of anticipation of new or unknown vulnerabilities. Therefore, in this work, we choose an approach to identify patterns and spots where there are potential vulnerabilities, termed security hotspots, so as not to detect vulnerabilities directly. We propose a rule-based plugin integrated into the IDE, which can detect eight security hotspots in the PHP web application program code based on the Laravel framework. We have implemented a proof-of-concept extension/plugin in the popular VSCode code editor (for this initial stage, only running on Windows OS), which is developed from PHP_CodeSniffer. Experiments on 10 Laravel-based projects presented an accuracy of 98.6% and an F1 score of 87.36%. When running, the extension takes 1 ms for the shortest number of tokens, 66 tokens, and 382 ms for the most extended tokens (4,051 tokens). The result shows that this plugin can help in code analysis on Laravel-based projects. Our approach can also effectively complement existing software security best practices.","2640-0227","979-8-3503-8138-2","10.1109/ICoDSE59534.2023.10291941","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10291941","security;vulnerabilities;security hotspot;static analysis;Laravel","Deep learning;Codes;Software;Real-time systems;Application security;Security;Best practices","","","","29","IEEE","27 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This issue may be addressed by implementing practical or “hands-on” learning experiences that allow students to construct their knowledge and apply skills in real-world scenarios. This work proposes to create learning experiences supported by blended learning spaces, including traditional classrooms for direct instruction, daily-life scenarios for experiential learning enabled by wearable devices, and cloudbased programming environments for online collaborative work. The learning experience presented was implemented in a biomedical signals and systems course. Students used health wearables to record their physiological and behavioral signals in everyday scenarios and Google Collaboratory notebooks to analyze the collected data. The survey results applied to students suggest that technology-enabled blended learning spaces positively impact students’ perception of their learning experience. However, other potential benefits in learning derived from the use of technologies, such as increased student engagement and motivation and improved learning outcomes, require further investigation. This is particularly relevant given the monetary investment that scaling up this pedagogical approach would need.","","978-1-6654-9416-8","10.1109/IEEECONF56852.2023.10104837","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10104837","engineering education;learning spaces;technology-enabled learning;wearable devices;cloud computing technology;higher education;educational innovation","Technological innovation;Federated learning;Wearable computers;Space technology;Collaboration;Physiology;Internet","","1","","31","IEEE","21 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While sites like Stack Overflow (SO) contain API examples embedded within their textual descriptions, developers cannot access this API knowledge directly. Instead they need to search for and browse results to select relevant SO posts and then read through individual posts to figure out which answers contain information about the APIs that are relevant to their task. This paper introduces an approach, called Scout, that automatically analyzes search results to extract API signature information. These signatures are used to group and rank examples and allow for a unique API-based presentation that reduces the amount of information the developer needs to consider when looking for API information on the web. This succinct representation enables Scout to be integrated fully within an IDE panel so that developers can search and view API examples without losing context on their development task. Scout also uses this integration to automatically augment queries with contextual information that tailors the developer's queries, and ranks the results according to the developer's needs. In an experiment with 40 developers, we found that Scout reduces the number of queries developers need to perform by 19% and allows them to solve almost half their tasks directly from the API-based representation, reducing the number of complete SO posts viewed by approximately 64%.","1558-1225","979-8-4007-0217-4","10.1145/3597503.3639089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10549139","API signatures;code search;controlled experiment","Information resources;Codes;Source coding;Search engines;Programming;Data mining;Task analysis","","","","50","","14 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many of such systems are (1) numerous, (2) widely distributed over a large geographical area, and (3) often connected to a network. Software enhancements and bug-fixes to software running on such remotely deployed embedded systems might sometimes need to be done. The large numbers of systems that might need to be re-programmed, and/or the remote/inaccessible location of such systems often poses a major hurdle in the process. Several industrial solutions for re-programming distributed embedded systems do exist, viz., systems that use Remote Terminal Units, Programmable Logic Controllers or Programmable Automation Controllers. However, these systems are both complex and expensive. We propose a method to remotely program microcontroller-based distributed embedded systems. Such microcontroller-based solutions are the systems of choice for low-cost, high-volume, distributed embedded systems. Our approach is simple and is more suitable when a direct network connection to each of the distributed embedded systems is available. We use a simple web-based interface to write programs on a modern browser, and download the program onto a light-weight server attached to the remote embedded system. The server checks the code for errors and then updates the embedded system with the new version of the software. This solution is more amenable for low-cost systems and where each system is directly connected to the Internet. We believe that this model of reprogramming remote, connected embedded systems will help reduce the time to market, cost, maintenance effort and digital footprint of such systems.","","978-1-5090-2029-4","10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732276","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7732276","Arduino;Remote programming;firmware update","Servers;Programming;Embedded systems;Computers;HTML;Internet","","2","","23","IEEE","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Players of MOBA games usually practice their game skills by playing with a bot. As creating a bot is difficult and rather complex, therefore this paper proposes an idea to develop a distributed simulation system for training game coding and testing game codes by displaying results in a mini map (2-D map). A MOBA game API is also provided for cooperating with the simulation software and so is software supporting many users for their bot programming. In addition, users can use this software to test their bot codes or to practice bot programming in a unique style launched by their own idea and to see the results from the monitor.

This helps the datacenter management team to take immediate action to rectify this temperature deviation. Also this can be monitored from anywhere anytime over online dashboard by the senior level professionals who are not present in the data centre at any point in time. This Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) based monitoring system consists of temperature sensors, ESP8266 and Wi-Fi router. ESP8266 is a low power, highly integrated Wi-Fi solution from Espress if. The ESP8266 here, in this prototype, connects to `Ubidots' cloud through its API for posting temperature data to the cloud dashboard on real time and the cloud event management system generates alerts whenever the high temperature alert event is fired. Cloud events need to be configured for different alerts beforehand through the user friendly user interface of the platform. It's to be noted that the sensor used here can be leveraged to monitor the relative humidity of the data center environment as well along with the temperature of the data center.

In a cloud data center, cloud service providers offer many kinds of cloud services, such as virtual machines (VMs), to users. How to achieve the optimized allocation of VMs for users to satisfy the requirements of both users and providers is an important problem. To make full use of VMs for providers and ensure low makespan of user tasks, we formulate an optimal allocation model of VMs and develop an improved differential evolution (IDE) method to solve this optimization problem, given a batch of user tasks. We compare the proposed method with several existing methods, such as round-robin (RR), min-min, and differential evolution. The experimental results show that it can more efficiently decrease the cost of cloud service providers while achieving lower makespan of user tasks than its three peers. Note to Practitioners-VM allocation is one of the challenging problems in cloud computing systems, especially when user task makespan and cost of cloud service providers have to be considered together. We propose an IDE approach to solve this problem. To show its performance, this article compares the commonly used methods, i.e., RR and min-min, as well as the classic differential evolution method. A cloud simulation platform called CloudSim is used to test these methods. The experimental results show that the proposed one can well outperform its compared ones, and its VM allocation results can achieve the highest satisfaction of both users and providers.

Nowadays, Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) is the fuel that is frequently used for cooking in the kitchen which is filled as a liquid in a cylinder. Many accidents happen because of the blast of these cylinders, mainly due to gas leakage in the kitchen. Due to LPG's high level of flammability, even a minor gas leak can pose a serious hazard to the environment. So, in order to avoid this, we must find, warn about, and stop gas leaks. Not only is the detection of gas leakage important but the control and prevention of leakage are also most important.

Although simulation plays a pivotal role in niche cases, it is an undervalued tool in the broader enterprise context. Its proliferation has not kept up with recent technological advances such as big data, cloud computing, graphics processing units clusters, and cross-layer enterprise integration. Based on such new developments, new capabilities can be realized that go beyond single-purpose simulations, and are an excellent fit for studying heterogeneous, independently developed System-of-Systems (SoS), in a multitude of scenarios in complex and dynamic enterprise environments. Co-simulation efforts can provide new insights on the enterprise operations including compelling visualizations of possible simulated alternatives, thereby assisting decision makers in their strategy selection. To move beyond niche applications, however, simulated systems need to integrate in real-time, a continually increasing amount of data (both real and simulated), stemming from various domains and their systems. This work presents a way to achieve such distributed simulations in modern enterprise environments, based on HighLevel Architecture (HLA), as well as their coordination via the Run-Time Infrastructure (RTI). In an example scenario featuring a co-simulation of a corporate electric vehicle fleet, it is shown how various software subsystems interact to enable business users to visually investigate scenarios, as well as how such a system can be deployed and operated within a modern enterprise IT landscape.","2474-2325","978-1-5386-3615-2","10.1109/SII.2019.8700423","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8700423","","Containers;Computer architecture;Tools;Data visualization;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Data models","","6","","21","IEEE","29 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the context of program comprehension, only few approaches integrate visualizations into code editors, such as integrated development environments. This is surprising since professional developers consider reading source code as one of the most important ways to understand software, therefore spend a lot of time with code editors. In this paper, we introduce the design and proof-of-concept implementation for a software visualization approach that can be embedded into code editors. Our contribution differs from related work in that we use dynamic analysis of a software system's runtime behavior. Additionally, we incorporate distributed tracing. This enables developers to understand how, for example, the currently handled source code behaves as a fully deployed, distributed software system. Our visualization approach enhances common remote pair programming tools and is collaboratively usable by employing shared code cities. As a result, user interactions are synchronized between code editor and visualization, as well as broadcasted to collaborators. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that combines code editors with collaboratively usable code cities. Therefore, we conducted a user study to collect first-time feedback regarding the perceived usefulness and perceived usability of our approach. We additionally collected logging information to provide more data regarding time spent in code cities that are embedded in code editors. Seven teams with two students each participated in that study. The results show that the majority of participants find our approach useful and would employ it for their own use.

This study aims to shed light on these aspects by following a mixed-methods research approach. We conduct an online survey capturing how 176 developers reflect on debugging. We augment this subjective survey data with objective observations on how 458 developers use the debugger included in their integrated development environments (IDEs) by instrumenting the popular Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEs with the purpose-built plugin WatchDog 2.0. To clarify the insights and discrepancies observed in the previous steps, we followed up by conducting interviews with debugging experts and regular debugging users. Our results indicate that IDE-provided debuggers are not used as often as expected, as ""printf debugging"" remains a feasible choice for many programmers. Furthermore, both knowledge and use of advanced debugging features are low. These results call to strengthen hands-on debugging experience in computer science curricula and have already refined the implementation of modern IDE debuggers.","1558-1225","978-1-4503-5638-1","10.1145/3180155.3180175","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8453125","Debugging;Testing;WatchDog;IntelliJ;Eclipse","Debugging;Software;Tools;Instruments;Interviews;Computer bugs;Software engineering","","20","","","","2 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Its widespread adoption by the industry and its simplicity led the academy to address the development of systems using these 8 or 16 bit microcontrollers in its introductory-level electrical engineering curricula. Typically, a microcontroller of the MSP, AVR, MCS-51 or PIC family is used. Although in person laboratory work offers students the opportunity for acquiring skills related to practical experience with hardware and development boards, availability of hardware resources might be reduced in autonomous or online contexts. In these scenarios, simulation tools can be highly valuable, as an alternative or complementary option to laboratory work. Standard development tools are often unsuited for such purposes, because they are oriented to development activities that often assume the availability of hardware resources for executing, testing and debugging the system. To address this, this paper presents a survey of the ecosystem of tools for 8 or 16 bit microprocessors and microcontrollers development focused on their capability for supporting the simulation of embedded systems, and evaluate these solutions from the perspective of their potential for enabling autonomous study and learning by students. This comparative analysis can be very useful as it can serve as a decision factor for the choice of the microcontroller or microprocessor and toolchain to adopt in curriculum design, while it also identifies opportunities for new developments to address existing limitations.","2472-7687","978-1-6654-8442-8","10.1109/EAEEIE54893.2022.9820021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9820021","microcontroller simulators;online learning;autonomous learning;development tools;embedded systems","Electrical engineering;Analytical models;Embedded systems;Program processors;Power demand;Microcontrollers;Hardware","","","","15","IEEE","13 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Still, the interactivity of these videos is limited primarily to control video flow. There are existing works with increased interactivity that are shown to improve the learning experience. Still, these solutions require setting up a custom recording environment and are not well-integrated with the playback environment. This paper describes our integrated ITSS environment and evaluates the ease of authoring and playback of our interactive programming tutorials. Our environment is designed to run within the browser sandbox and is less intrusive to record interactivity actions. We develop a recording approach that tracks the author’s interactivity actions (e.g., typing code, highlighting words, scrolling panels) on the browser and stored in text and audio formats. We replay these actions using the recorded artefacts for learners to have a more interactive, integrated and realistic playback of the author’s actions instead of watching video frames. Our design goals are 1) eﬃcient recording and playback, 2) extensible interactivity features to help students learn better, and 3) a scalable web-based environment. Our first user study of 20 participants who carry out the author tasks agree that it is eﬃcient and easy to author interactive videos in our environment with no additional software needed. Our second user study of 84 students using the environment agrees that the increased interactivity can help them learn better over a video-based tutorial. Our performance test shows that the environment can scale to support up to 500 concurrent users.

Aimed at facilitating rapid construction of CMfg services, this letter proposes a novel automated construction scheme for developing CMfg services, called Manufacturing Service Automated Construction Scheme (MSACS). First, we develop a three-phase workflow of MSACS to address the issues of how to construct CMfg services automatically using standalone software library package (SSLP). Next, we design a system architecture of MSACS to delineate how to implement MSACS. Then, we depict the designs of MSACS's core components. Finally, we apply MSACS to conduct industrial case studies to build the automatic virtual metrology cloud service and intelligent yield management cloud service for an intelligent manufacturing platform. Testing results demonstrate that MSACS can automatically construct the target CMfg services in a very efficient manner after uploading the required SSLPs. Thus, MSACS can significantly alleviate the burden of engineers in building CMfg services, and in turn can facilitate the promotion of CMfg.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2018.2799420","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 105-2221-E-034-002,106-2221-E-034-014,106-2221-E-006-005,106-2218-E-006-005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8272351","Intelligent and flexible manufacturing;middleware and programming environments;cloud manufacturing service;fast automated construct scheme","Manufacturing;Cloud computing;Graphical user interfaces;Libraries;Web servers","","12","","13","IEEE","30 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article proposes an online method for estimating missing data in case of a network of $n$ sensors. The true sensor value at a specific location is expressed using an integro-difference equation. The Karhunen–Loéve Expansion of the spatial process allows one to represent the ST field values at $n$ locations in the form of a linear state-space model. The parameters of the model are identified using the maximum likelihood method. The parameters are updated in a rolling window approach. Whenever missing data are encountered, the algorithm predicts the missing observations based on the constrained solution of state evolution equation. The constrained solution is obtained by representing the optimal state as the orthogonal sum decomposition of a deterministic and a stochastic component. The utility of the algorithm is presented on two sensor network datasets.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2021.3100501","Department of Telecom, Government of India(grant numbers:RP03521); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9497764","Integro-difference equation (IDE);missing data;online estimation;sensor network;spatio-temporal (ST)","Mathematical model;Sensors;Data models;Adaptation models;Matrix decomposition;Kernel;State estimation","","5","","34","IEEE","27 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a system that addresses the limitations of traditional parking systems, emphasizing inefficient space utilization, limited visibility, and suboptimal user experiences. To tackle these challenges, it introduces an Intelligent Parking System employing Infrared (IR) sensors strategically positioned for precise real-time car detection. By leveraging a centralized processing unit, manual monitoring issues are resolved, enabling swift data analysis. The system's dynamic web interface offers users real-time parking status, historical data, and trends, mitigating uncertainties about spot availability. Integrating IR sensors, Raspberry Pi Pico W, and React JS methodologies, the IPS fosters a scalable design, accommodating additional sensors and presenting a holistic solution to contemporary parking dilemmas. This approach not only maximizes parking space utilization but also enhances urban mobility, promising a comprehensive and adaptive answer to modern parking challenges. We have researched a smart parking system using OpenCV as well.

The models created with the platform are translated by its compiler into a set of standard-technology artifacts (C#, JavaScript, SQL, etc). The model must be checked for consistency (i.e., that it is well-formed and well-typed) before compilation can proceed. Our Integrated Development Environment (IDE) does this in real-time: after each change made a developer, the IDE either automatically heals the other parts of the model that are impacted by the change, or provides immediate feedback on the errors that must be manually corrected. It is not uncommon for an OutSystems model to contain in excess of 200,000 individual elements. Handling large models efficiently is thus of paramount importance: consistency checks must run as fast as possible, otherwise the developer's experience is significantly impaired. In this paper we present the techniques we have developed to speed up consistency checks, and which resulted in the TrueChangeTM engine. We use an incremental approached paired with automatically managed back pointers.

As a blockchain network, Solana is a de-centralized public ledger for verifying and recording transactions. The Solana blockchain has smart contract capabilities. Unlike other blockchains, such as Ethereum, there is no repository or tool where to check for the source code of the smart contracts stored in the blockchain. These tools are crucial to increase the users' trust in this type of technology. Indeed, one of the most important features of the blockchain is transparency, i.e. the possibility to see the source code of the program to use, or in which the users wish to invest. However, in the blockchains that support smart contracts, what is stored is not the source code of the smart contract written in a high-level program understandable to humans, but the bytecode, i.e. a low-level code made for the hardware to be executed. For some blockchains, such as Ethereum, there are different tools, such as integrated development environment (IDE), that allow to verify that the smart contracts' source code corresponds to the bytecode installed on the nodes of the blockchain. Moreover, there are different repositories that collect smart contracts written in a high-level programming language and their corresponding bytecode. However, for the Solana blockchain, all these tools do not exist yet. The study proposes a web tool that allows verifying the ownership of a smart contract, i. e. the smart contracts' source code written in a high-level programming language corresponds to the bytecode deployed in the Solana blockchain. Moreover, we have published smart contracts' source code written in high-level programming via a public service that can be used by researchers, smart contract developers, and blockchain not-expert users.","1534-5351","978-1-6654-3786-8","10.1109/SANER53432.2022.00140","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9825771","Blockchain;Solana;Source Code","Computer languages;Codes;Conferences;Smart contracts;Programming;Software;Hardware","","3","","25","IEEE","21 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, we developed a prototype that allows information to be displayed on a smartphone application. For this, the mobile device communicates with the beacon, which indicates the information that must be displayed in the application. Although any content can be used in this proposal, we show as example the curricular content of an educational center. The proposed prototype takes advantage of the operating principle of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The use of Beacons allows Smartphone-Beacon automated communication. More specifically, a mobile application has been developed in the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of Android Studio, which is responsible for scanning the iBeacon protocol and the automatic generation of the notification that links the end user to a web repository.

These digital platforms afford individuals the ability to effortlessly monitor and manage their health-related issues, as well as store, share, and access their medical records and treatment information. As the utilization of mHealth apps becomes increasingly widespread, it is imperative to ensure that protected health information (PHI) is effectively and securely transmitted, received, created, and maintained in accordance with the regulations set forth by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). However, it is unfortunate to note that many mobile app developers, including those of mHealth apps, are not fully cognizant of the HIPAA security and privacy guidelines. This presents a unique opportunity for research to develop an analytical framework that can aid developers in maintaining a secure and HIPAA-compliant source code, while also raising awareness among consumers about the privacy and security of sensitive health information. The plan is to develop a framework which will serve as the foundation for developing an integrated development environment (IDE) plugin for mHealth app developers and a web-based interface for mHealth app consumers. This will help developers identify and address HIPAA compliance issues during the development process and provide consumers with a tool to evaluate the privacy and security of mHealth apps before downloading and using them.

Pocket Code is a free and open source integrated development environment (IDE) for the brick based visual programming language Catrobat. It is released in various flavors for different partners and projects (e.g., Create@School, Phiro and Standalone). All flavors use the same code base but slightly differ in design and functionality. If different flavors are maintained as separate projects, all projects require proper maintenance. Any feature introduced or updated in one project must be ported to all others, for that they dont diverge. With an increase in the number of flavors, efforts to maintain will also increase which renders the project unmaintainable. If all flavors are maintained in one project, it is challenging to release more than one version of an application with a different set of functionalities and different user interface (UI) enhancements. In this paper, Pocket Code's different build variants are discussed particularly the standalone build variant. To build a standalone version of any app hosted on the Pocket Code sharing platform, the user has to trigger the build via the web interface on the remote Pocket Code server. Resource files and app configuration are generated based on user input.

HGrid is a Hadoop data engineering tool made by solusi247 for Map Reduce, Spark and Storm frameworks which has been built since 2011 to help programmers building server-side data processing applications by automatically generate codes based on visually designed workflow. The biggest challenge to build this tool was to make most of the functions, modules, libraries and even workflow schemes (nearly) compatible between frameworks and to make a multipurpose single Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Big Data availlable in the desktop and on the cloud. The development of the HGrid library starts with the collection of functions needed, how they can be implemented in each framework and how the codes can be generated. HGrid generated codes were also benchmarked against some commercially availlable tools to ensure good performance. HGrid is also designed to be visual, robust and user friendly although it still need to be improved in user experience part. It is also designed for average programmers and analysts. Data engineering libraries has been continuosly developed to ease application development with target near zero programming at the programmers side. HGrid has been used largely at the telco operators in Indonesia, in the largest banks, government institutions, hospitals and military to build complex applications such as Data Lake, Mediation Device, Media Analytics and many others.","","978-1-7281-8741-9","10.1109/CcS49175.2020.9231309","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9231309","","Visualization;Codes;Storms;Programming;Media;Data engineering;Libraries","","","","0","IEEE","20 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address these issues, a new service architecture based on the containerized PAAS(Platform as a service) model was proposed, which has two cores, namely ERAAS(Every-Resources As A Service) ecology management module and ROOP(Resource-Oriented Online Programming) service support module. ERAAS is a new concept defined in this paper and is a type of XAAS(Anything as a Service) in the context of online programming, whose ecosphere includes full-chain resources, and ROOP is an online programming mode that adds support for the ERAAS ecosystem, which can use or create resources. The current vision of architecture has three key designs, supporting developers to customize the resource runtime environment, setting up the ”release” function to build the application ecology, and putting the resource configuration information of released application into the profile pool to provide decision support for the adaptive configuration recommendation, thus transforming the role of developer from the user of the online programming environment to the creator of the online programming ecology and promoting the self-growth and evolution of the online programming ecology to achieve efficient use of resources and improve execution efficiency. However, the architecture proposed in this paper is still not perfect and lacks incentives for ecological activity, and further optimization of the adaptive algorithm is expected.","","979-8-3503-4586-5","10.1109/SNPD-Winter57765.2023.10223940","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1709503); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10223940","resource-oriented;ERAAS;online programming ecology;adaptive configuration","Adaptation models;Runtime environment;Biological system modeling;Computer architecture;Programming;Ecology;Resource management","","","","18","IEEE","28 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This new hybrid cloud infrastructure makes it possible to mix and match platforms and cloud providers for various software development activities. There are several benefits of the multi-cloud infrastructure such as lower level of vendor lock-in and minimize the risk of widespread data loss or downtime. However, it has many challenges such as non-standard and inherent complexity due to different technologies, interfaces, and services. Docker has introduced container-based software development approach in the past few years and gaining popularity in the software industry. It has recently introduced its distributed system development tool called Swarm, which extends the Docker container-based software development process on multiple hosts in multiple clouds without any interoperability issue. Docker Swarm-based distributed software development is a newborn approach for the cloud industry; nonetheless, it has a huge potential to provide multi-cloud development environment without worrying the complexity of it. This paper presents the simulation of building a virtual system of systems (SoS) for the distributed software development process on multiple clouds. This simulation of virtual SoS is based on Docker Swarm, VirtualBox, Mac OS X, nginx and redis. However, the same SoS can be created on any of the Docker supported cloud by just changing the driver name to the desired cloud name such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Digital Ocean, Google Compute Engine, Exoscale, Generic, OpenStack, Rackspace, IBM Softlayer, VMware vCloud Air.","","978-1-5090-0793-6","10.1109/SysEng.2016.7753148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7753148","Docker;Swarm;Cloud;Virtual System of Systems;SoS;Container;Virtual Machine","Cloud computing;Containers;Servers;Buildings;System of systems","","59","","12","Crown","24 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper proposes an OGC-oriented interoperable script API called OGEScript. By leveraging the object-oriented design pattern, geospatial resources defined in OGC specifications are mapped to classes within the OGEScript. This mapping allows for a uniform script-based object access to data and processing functions (traditionally in OGC APIs) available in background cloud platforms.

An IoT kit was prepared using gas sensors, Arduino integrated development environment (IDE), and a Wi-Fi module. This kit can be physically placed in various cities to monitoring air pollution. The gas sensors gather data from air and forward the data to the Arduino IDE. The Arduino IDE transmits the data to the cloud via the Wi-Fi module. We also developed an Android application termed IoT-Mobair, so that users can access relevant air quality data from the cloud. If a user is traveling to a destination, the pollution level of the entire route is predicted, and a warning is displayed if the pollution level is too high.

For this reason, many chatbot development tools have emerged, which makes choosing the most appropriate tool difficult. Moreover, there is hardly any support for migrating chatbots between tools. To alleviate these issues, we propose a model-driven engineering solution that includes: (i) a domain-specific language to model chatbots independently of the development tool; (ii) a recommender that suggests the most suitable development tool for the given chatbot requirements and model; (iii) code generators that synthesize the chatbot code for the selected tool; and (iv) parsers to extract chatbot models out of existing chatbot implementations.

However, participating in these courses usually means fully committing to the supplied programming environment in the browser. While this allows a consistent and controllable setup, learners do not gain experience with actual development tools, such as local code editors, testing frameworks, issue trackers or continuous integration (CI) services, which is critical for subsequent real-world projects. Furthermore, the tests for the functionality that is to be developed are oftentimes already available in MOOCs and simply need to be executed, leading to less involvement with developing appropriate tests. In order to tackle these issues while maintaining a high degree of automation and scalability, we developed Prof. CI, a novel approach to conducting online exercises. Prof. CI leverages the existing automation infrastructure that developers use daily, i.e. CI services and Github workflows, to teach test-driven development (TDD) practices. Participants work on their own repositories in Github and receive feedback and new challenges from the CI server when they push their code. We have successfully applied this approach in a pilot project with 30 undergraduate students learning the Ruby on Rails web development framework. Our evaluation shows that the exercise effectively increased students' motivation to write tests for their code. We also present the results of participant surveys, students' experiences and teachers' observations.","","978-1-5090-5920-1","10.1109/FIE.2017.8190589","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8190589","","Software;Programming;Tools;Servers;Testing;Education","","8","","13","IEEE","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Previous studies show that program comprehension takes up as much as half of a developer's time. However, most of these studies are performed in a controlled setting, or with a small number of participants, and investigate the program comprehension activities only within the IDEs. However, developers' program comprehension activities go well beyond their IDE interactions. In this paper, we extend our ActivitySpace framework to collect and analyze Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) data across many applications (not just the IDEs). We follow Minelli et al.'s approach to assign developers' activities into four categories: navigation, editing, comprehension, and other. We then measure the comprehension time by calculating the time that developers spend on program comprehension, e.g., inspecting console and breakpoints in IDE, or reading and understanding tutorials in web browsers. Using this approach, we can perform a more realistic investigation of program comprehension activities, through a field study of program comprehension in practice across a total of seven real projects, on 78 professional developers, and amounting to 3,148 working hours. Our study leverages interaction data that is collected across many applications by the developers. Our study finds that on average developers spend ~58 percent of their time on program comprehension activities, and that they frequently use web browsers and document editors to perform program comprehension activities. We also investigate the impact of programming language, developers' experience, and project phase on the time that is spent on program comprehension, and we find senior developers spend significantly less percentages of time on program comprehension than junior developers. Our study also highlights the importance of several research directions needed to reduce program comprehension time, e.g., building automatic detection and improvement of low quality code and documentation, construction of software-engineering-specific search engines, designing better IDEs that help developers navigate code and browse information more efficiently, etc.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2017.2734091","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61602403,61572426); National Key Technology R&D Program; Ministry of Science and Technology of China(grant numbers:2015BAH17F01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7997917","Program comprehension;field study;inference model","Navigation;Software;Time measurement;Browsers;Maintenance engineering;Programming;Debugging","","160","","63","IEEE","31 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a model transformation architecture based on software standards to automatically generate full stack multi-layered WebApps covering Persistence, Service, and Presentation layers. This transformation architecture also generates the set of test cases to test WebApp business logic. The proposed transformation architecture only requires a UML platform-independent class model as an input to generate fully functional Web applications in a three-tier architecture including the three layers, while most proposals focus on the generation of the Presentation layer. In addition, this architecture employs software industry standards to enable an easy integration into third-party tools and development environments.

The MyRIO is a reconfigurable device developed by National Instruments that combines a real-time processor and an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) to provide data acquisition and control capabilities. By using a MyRIO-based remote laboratory, students can perform experiments and collect data without needing to be physically present in a laboratory, which can be especially useful for remote learning or for providing access to equipment that may be difficult or expensive to access otherwise. The online platform is analogous to an IoT ecosystem and has multiple myRIO student-embedded devices as hardware nodes linked to the SystemLink local server and SystemLink cloud platform. The online remote laboratory platform contains multiple experiments in a single myRIO device, and a method for reconfiguring the device from a cloud platform to select specific experiments was developed. An innovative method was devised to transfer data between the hardware nodes and the cloud platform. Using a two-stage mechanism, data was transferred from the myRIO device to the computer using global variables and from the computer to the cloud using System Link tags.

"Infrastructure as Code for Heterogeneous Computing","D. Vladusic; D. Radolovic",XLAB Slovenia; XLAB Slovenia,2020 22nd International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing (SYNASC),"24 Feb 2021","2020","","","1","2","Setting up an infrastructure for application deployment is a non-trivial task. We usually simplify the task by using the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach. Through IaC we set-up software defined infrastructure, able to run applications. Several tools and platforms have been developed to describe the system and to implement the actual deployment of the application (e.g., Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Terraform, etc.). When the infrastructure is heterogeneous (e.g., combination of Cloud and HPC) the challenges to set up a collaborative infrastructure is even harder, as the paradigms and environments differ significantly. Cloud infrastructure is focusing on servers, events, functions, while the HPC infrastructure is procedural and takes the application and merely executes it, usually on bare metal. As expected, the applications deployed on the respective systems differ in their dynamics and longevity. Whilst deployment of applications on the Cloud can be solved with the aforementioned tools, the HPC systems are in this respect in their infancy � the application is usually scheduled to be executed on a pre-defined set of processors and from that point on, the scripts merely gather input data, execute the application and then organize the output data. Merging the two approaches is thus currently rather hard and requires an explicit boundary between the Cloud and HPC parts of the application, posing a significant issue for the overall modelling and thus set-up of the system with the IaC approach. SODALITE, an H2020 project, is targeting simplification of the application deployment complexity while retaining or improving application performance on targeted HPC heterogeneous and cloud systems. The application deployment is abstracted through modelling of application's component relationships, policies and performance. The application is deployed using appropriate container technologies, matching the targeted heterogeneous HPC and cloud-based platforms. The starting point is the definition of the system and the application within an AI-supported IDE, using a straightforward, TOSCA-similar language. The smart IDE backed with the Graph DB knowledge base supports the user with the suggestions on how the system and application could (or should) be modelled. In the next general step, this definition is executed through an orchestrator, resulting in an execution of the application within the software-defined environment. In cases where the source code is available, it is optimised for the targeted infrastructure before execution. This step ensures that the application performance is not lost due to abstraction. However, in all cases, the execution of the application is monitored, as SODALITE is using machine learning and controltheory approaches to improve runtime performance. SODALITE is currently in the middle of its development thus not all of its functionalities are available. Whilst we first addressed the typical private Cloud infrastructures (e.g. OpenStack) and HPC (e.g. Torque job scheduler) using containers to encapsulate the applications, there is still work to be done to address public Clouds (e.g. AWS) and other HPC schedulers (e.g. Slurm). The IDE is functional, however it still requires further improvements and enhancements. Finally, not all optimisation approaches are developed at the moment. The aim of the proposed approach is to flatten the learning curve for Ops enabling them to concentrate on domain problems, resulting in lower overall costs of development and application lifecycle management.","","978-1-7281-7628-4","10.1109/SYNASC51798.2020.00011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9357104","","Cloud computing;Tutorials;Codes;Training;Task analysis;Optimization;Deep learning","","2","","","IEEE","24 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Assuming that data exists from a study in which both predicted programmer difficulties and ground truth were recorded while running an online algorithm for detecting difficulties, the tool allows researchers to interactively travel through a timeline showing the correlation between values of the features used to make predictions, difficulty predictions made by the online algorithm, and ground truth. We used the tool to improve an existing online algorithm based on a study involving the development of a GUI in Java. Episodes of difficulty predicted by the previously developed algorithm were correlated with features extracted from participant logs of interaction with the programming environment and web browser. The visualizations produced from the tool contribute to a better understanding of programmer actions during periods of difficulty, help to identify specific issues with the previous prediction algorithm, and suggest potential solutions to these issues.

OutSystems developers interact with Service Studio, the platform’s IDE, using domain-specific visual languages to shape the fine-grained application model.In recent years, OutSystems introduced the “Application Builders”, a set of tools that lower the learning curve even more and provide an inclusive entrance to non-IT developers. The builders focus on specific application development scopes such as User Experience or the definition of Business Processes. Each application domain requires a specific and appropriate meta-model abstracting selected parts of the underlying OutSystems model. Ultimately, they represent OutSystems concepts in a higher degree of abstraction, just like views of the base model.OutSystems builders define a unidirectional model transformation strategy. This limitation hinders the interoperability between the different development tools in the OutSystems ecosystem. An application developed with one particular builder is unreadable in other builders and can only be further customized in Service Studio. However, changes made in the IDE are irreversible and unreadable by the original builder. This comes off as a direct consequence of the current problem of OutSystems builders defining unidirectional model transformations.In this paper, we explicitly address this limitation by defining fully bidirectional builder model transformations in OutSystems: builder to IDE and IDE to builder. The implemented strategy consists of a synchronization algorithm that maintains consistency between models on all allowed evolutions, thus leading to the point where builders become model editors.The instantiated and evaluated implementation focuses on one particular builder of OutSystems, the “Experience Builder”. We successfully represented all Service Studio operations that become either invisible or correctly mapped onto the builder’s model. In addition, it was possible to portray evolution steps taken in the builder tool without reverting the customization made in Service Studio.","","978-1-6654-2484-4","10.1109/MODELS-C53483.2021.00022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9643706","editors;model transformations;BPT;MDE;continuous collaboration","Visualization;Shape;Ecosystems;Collaboration;User experience;Model driven engineering;Mobile applications","","1","","20","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, monitoring the state of animals on a daily basis is complicated because workers lack the time to examine animals and detect early signs of sickness, and environmental conditions have such an effect on cattle health. The proposed system consists of sensors and microcontroller, cloud, and an android application for maintaining the cattle shed environment, regulating livestock health, and environmental conditions. The sensors monitor and collect environmental parameters such as temperature, soil moisture, fire detection, rain level, and gas values. The ESP32 microcontroller is utilized, and the Esp32Sensor component provides access to the Esp32 board’s in- targeted sensors. To configure the ESP32, the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is utilized. The data is processed entirely in the ESP32 microcontroller using embedded C. The DHT11 sensor detects temperature using Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) and sends serial data to the ESP32 through the Data port. The ESP32 monitors the temperature, and, if the threshold is exceeded, the cooling fan connected via the relay is activated. The soil moisture sensor provides an analog output pin that emits voltage that is proportional to its moisture level. ESP32 activates a pump to irrigate the plants when the level is low. Raindrop Sensors are made up of two parts: a raindrop module that detects whether or not it is raining and a control board that processes data from the raindrop module by translating resistance into a voltage drop between the analog pin and ground. The MQ2 gas sensor detects methane. The MQ2 gas sensor generates output determined by a specified threshold through the potentiometer and the operating voltage of the microcontroller via LM393 dual comparator.

We illustrate our work based on a case study, and evaluate the CostHat model using a standalone Python implementation. We show that, once instantiated, cost calculation in CostHat is computationally inexpensive on standard hardware (below 1 ms even for applications consisting of thousand services and endpoints).

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Developer interaction data is a rich trove of information that can be analysed and mined to better comprehend developer activities and which in turn shed light into their pain points and needs and empower developers to perform their tasks more effectively and/or efficiently. Interaction data can be obtained by tracking developer activities in IDE and also related tools that developers regularly use to accomplish their day-to-day tasks (e.g., web browser). Mining and analysis of developer interaction data is a relatively young topic in the area of mining software repositories (MSR). And as such, it is now an exciting time where there are much challenges to address and opportunities to tap on.This talk highlights several of our recent work which is part of the exciting community-wide effort to tackle challenges and take advantage of the potentials of mining developer interaction data. In particular, this talk, which is divided into 3 parts, highlights how developer interaction data can be mined to (1) comprehend how developers understand programs, (2) comprehend how developers search the web, and (3) empower developers to create interactive video tutorials. In the first part, I’ll describe our field study of program comprehension in practice by analysing developer interaction data within and outside IDE across a total of seven real projects, on 78 professional developers, and amounting to 3,148 working hours. In the second part, I describe our mixed-method study based on collecting search queries from 60 developers’ interaction data and surveying 235 software engineers from more than 21 countries across five continues to understand what developers frequently search for and of the search tasks that they often find challenging. In the final part, I describe our work that design and build a programming video tutorial authoring system that that leverages operating system level instrumentation to log workflow history while tutorial authors are creating programming videos, and the corresponding tutorial watching system that enhances the learning experience of video tutorials by providing programming-specific workflow history and timeline-based browsing interactions.Aside from methodologies and findings, opportunities in terms of open technical problems and potential benefits of mining developer interaction data will also be discussed. Hopefully, the talk would inspire attendees to continue innovating in this exciting research topic.","","978-1-7281-0956-5","10.1109/MAINT.2019.8666934","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8666934","Interaction Data;Comprehending Developers;Interactive Videos","Videos;Tutorials;Data mining;Task analysis;Software engineering;Software;Programming profession","","","","","IEEE","14 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Any delay in the timings of these flights can adversely affect the work and business of thousands of people at any given moment. Forecasting these delays is very important during the planning process in commercial airlines. Several techniques have already been proposed for designing models to forecast the delay in departure time of aircraft. But because of the continuously increasing complexity of the airplane transportation and the amount of data related to it, designing accurate prediction methods has become very difficult. In this paper we utilise the method of logistic regression which is a supervised learning method to predict delay in departure times of aircraft. We utilise the Microsoft Azure Learning Studio platform which is an Integrated Development Environment for utilizing machine learning for training and testing the model on the cloud. We also join weather data such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, dew point along with the airport data to derive more accurate predictions as well as find out the effect of weather changes in flight delays. Our method was able to achieve about 80 percent accuracy in predicting whether a given aircraft would be delayed or not based on the training using past data.","","978-1-5386-1959-9","10.1109/ISS1.2017.8389254","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8389254","Cloud computing;logistic regression;Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio;supervised learning;flight delay;Forecasting;Data Pre-processing","Delays;Atmospheric modeling;Meteorology;Airports;Airplanes;Logistics","","6","","8","IEEE","21 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main idea of vertical farming is to use a controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) technology, where all environmental factors can be controlled. Therefore, in this project, an automatic system, which consists of the Internet of Thing [IoT] is implemented in providing the controlled environment for the vertical farming. The main purpose of this project is to build a system to monitor the soil moisture and to control water content through the web browser on the laptop, mobile phone and other handheld and compact devices. In this project, a soil moisture sensor is used to detect the moisture or water content of the soil in the vertical farm so that the plant can be consecutively monitored and controlled to have enough water. When low moisture level is detected, the signals are sent to the Arduino platform. Then, the data is stored eventually in the Arduino IDE software and simultaneously sent to the web browser through the Ethernet that is connected to the internet router. The user can monitor their plant through the web browser that allows them to read the status of the soil moisture and can control the water valve to release the water to the plant whenever the reading is low or necessary. With this development, the monitoring of the vertical farming has been so helpful and the growth of the plant can be supervised from time to time without having the operator at the event.","","978-1-5386-0908-8","10.1109/ICEESE.2017.8298388","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8298388","vertical farming system;internet of thing;moisture level monitor","Soil moisture;Browsers;Agriculture;Monitoring;Valves;Hardware","","30","","10","IEEE","22 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although block-based, most of these environments retain the imperative structures of textual programming languages, which are not easily comprehensible by such students. The proposed, in this paper, Learning-Arduino-With-Rules Introductory System (LAWRIS) tries to tackle this problem by adopting a rule-based approach: an Arduino-based pre-specified system can be programmed by constructing rules with very simple and intuitive jigsaw pieces, in a visual, web-based environment. Contrary to other programming environments for Arduino, the main logic of LAWRIS is implemented on the board side and only a configuration string is downloaded to it. Thus, LAWRIS features fast responses to both circuit input changes and program modifications, a very important characteristic for young students. It also imposes minimal overhead on the host system, allows web access of the programming environment, and has very low hardware cost.","","978-1-4673-9680-6","10.1109/MOCAST.2016.7495150","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7495150","rule-based programming;learning programming;Arduino;Blockly","Light emitting diodes;Computer languages;Visualization;Programming profession;Computers;Color","","12","","13","IEEE","23 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

After extracting links, they perform different types of attacks over each extracted link and try to find out existing vulnerabilities in the tested web application for reporting. A WAVS tool that has a low-quality crawler component would generate false-negative results, since failing to discover existing links would inhibit detection of possible vulnerabilities exposed through these links. Therefore, the coverage quality of its crawler plays a very important role in the success of a WAVS tool. In this paper, we propose a novel method for analyzing and comparing coverage qualities of WAVS crawlers. We developed WIVET (Web Input Vector Extractor Teaser) as a benchmarking tool for analyzing crawler components of WAVS. WIVET evaluates WAVS crawlers based on their extraction capability of 56 target links that are generated statically or dynamically by WIVET's 21 test cases.

Recent strides in technology showcase the feasibility of using manual gestures on Arduino platforms, facilitated by cloud computing. A Wi-Fi-based hand gesture computer control system was developed using an ESP-01 Wi-Fi module and an Arduino microcontroller, enabling remote control and monitoring without geographical constraints or time limitations. The ESP8266 Wi-Fi module played a crucial role in establishing wireless communication with an Android application (S Remote) for transmitting commands to regulate domestic appliances. The AT mega 328 AVR series Microcontroller R3, lacking built-in Wi-Fi, required the ESP-01 Wi-Fi module for wireless communication and programming. The Arduino IDE facilitated programming, incorporating ESP-01 and LCD components. Hand gesture-controlled robots and PC/laptop hand gesture control systems, both utilizing Arduino technology, exemplify similar applications. The Human Machine Interface (HMI) concept involves physical components and software enabling communication between users and machines. HMI devices, including LED indicators and touch screens, traditionally use keyboards and mice. This research implemented a hand gesture controller using Arduino technology, specifically for web browser features, video playback, and VLC media player audio adjustments. The ESP-01 Wi-Fi module, configured via AT instructions through a UART serial connection, played a key role in integrating a hand gesture system for effective computer control. Users can perform actions like playing or pausing videos and adjusting audio amplitude within the VLC media player solely through manual gestures.","","979-8-3503-4327-4","10.1109/ICTBIG59752.2023.10456351","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10456351","This research emphasizes creating a Wi-Fi computer control system incorporating hand gestures;artificial intelligence;an A Tmega328 microprocessor;a sensor system;and a user-friendly interface","Digital control;Wireless communication;Cloud computing;Microcontrollers;Manuals;Programming;Media","","","","15","IEEE","19 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the cloud computing scheduling problem, in order to efficiently and reasonably assign a large number of tasks submitted by users to cloud computing resources, a task scheduling algorithm (IDE) based on improved differential evolution is proposed to consider both task completion time and cost dual objectives. The algorithm introduces an immune operator into the traditional differential evolution algorithm. According to the vaccination probability, the population is vaccinated during the iterative process to speed up the convergence of the algorithm. Introducing the judgment mechanism on the selection strategy can shorten the running time of the algorithm and effectively improve the shortcomings of the standard differential evolution algorithm with slow convergence speed. The original fixed scaling factor F becomes adaptive, which helps to increase the diversity of the population. The simulation experiment of the proposed algorithm is performed on the cloud computing platform CloudSim. Comparing the IDE algorithm with the traditional differential evolution algorithm, genetic algorithm and Min-Min algorithm, the results show that IDE algorithm task completion time is short, which improves the utilization of cloud computing resource pools, and the cost of computing resources in a similar period of time is low.","2473-3636","978-1-5386-7445-1","10.1109/DCABES.2018.00018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8572516","cloud computing task scheduling;differential evolution;vaccination","Task analysis;Cloud computing;Sociology;Statistics;Scheduling algorithms;Computational modeling","","5","","16","IEEE","13 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Developed at the Institute of Automation and Electrometry SB RAS, EDTL is used for specifying requirements for reactive software. Such programs control cyber-physical systems, embedded systems, and PLC systems built using IEC 61131-3 or poST languages. Most of these safety critical systems are subject to mandatory verification. At the same time, as practice shows, failures in the operation of such systems in most cases are caused by errors in the specification of requirements. Therefore, the issue of requirements specification and the issue of requirements specification language are extremely important for the safety of the reactive system being developed. The advantages of EDTL include the relative simplicity of the language, the ability to specify requirements in terms of events and time intervals, independence from verification systems, and the presence of strict formal semantics that can be expressed using linear temporal logic. These advantages make EDTL a very promising requirements specification tool. The EDTL IDE comprises a language-oriented editor equipped with syntax and semantic analysis capabilities, an abstract syntax tree generator, and a library facilitating interaction with the generated abstract syntax tree. The research, the results of which are presented in the paper, is aimed at creating and EDTL IDE.

Although implementing a complete platform from scratch would achieve the best flexibility in terms of possible features, it also requires a huge time-consuming effort. This paper proposes Coderiu, a platform built on top of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) packages suitably integrated to implement the desired learning platform. Such features include platform independence of code editing, which is achieved by leveraging a web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The environment is extended with custom features to enable the automated testing of the solutions and the automatic remote backup of the working directories. Moreover, the architecture was made suitable to be used in classroom exams, which require a controlled environment. A critical aspect of the Coderiu platform, beside the integration of its components and modules, is represented by the scalability. The Coderiu platform is used by hundreds of students in case of courses in relatively small classes, while it is ready to serve a larger user base in the future. For this reason, requirements and performance are studied on a pilot installation to derive insights regarding the resources required for larger deployments.","2378-363X","978-1-7281-2927-3","10.1109/INDIN41052.2019.8972058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8972058","","","","1","","16","IEEE","30 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the past decades, several tools have emerged that are able to effectively compare large corpora of homeworks and sort pairs by degree of similarity. However, those tools are available to students as well, allowing them to experiment and develop elaborate methods for evading detection. Also, such tools are unable to detect instances of “external plagiarism” where students obtained unethical help from sources not among other students of the same course. One way to battle this problem is to monitor student activity while solving their homeworks using a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) and detect suspicious behaviours. Each editing event in program source can be stored as a new commit to create a form of ultra-fine-grained source code repository. In this paper, the authors propose several new features that can be extracted from such repositories with the purpose of building a comprehensive profile of each individual developer. Machine learning techniques were used to detect suspicious behaviours, which allowed the authors to significantly improve upon the performance of more traditional plagiarism detection tools.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2996146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9097285","Repository mining;plagiarism detection;ultra-fine-grained repositories;machine learning;feature extraction","Plagiarism;Tools;Feature extraction;Programming;Data mining;Cloning;Machine learning","","18","","37","CCBY","20 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, teachers expect that electronic exams provide support with respect to automatic assessment. In this paper, we investigate applying electronic exams to introductory programming courses. In these exams, students have to solve programming problems using an integrated development environment, and hand in source code as their solution. This, however, requires a shift in formulating exam tasks, in order to align these tasks with learning objectives. It also requires careful investigation into the students' ability to cope with the environment and the rigorous supervision by a compiler and other checkers under time restrictions and, possibly, the nerves of an exam situation. To achieve this, we discuss how programming tasks can be designed in a manner that allows addressing all levels of Bloom's taxonomy of learning objectives, in order to implement constructive alignment. Furthermore we analyze our students' behavior during exams and their perception of this kind of exam. As well, we analyze the resulting solutions and identify typical error patterns that occur.","2377-570X","978-1-7281-6807-4","10.1109/CSEET49119.2020.9206207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9206207","Educational technology;Courseware;Electronic exam;Measuring education and training results (MET);Programming education","Education;Task analysis;Programming profession;Software;Taxonomy;Testing","","1","","22","IEEE","14 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, problems still arise when companies craft an effective AR task support system, particularly in the difficulty of selecting appropriate techniques and information-presentation methods, and the requirements that vary with each use case. In this study, we formulated a corresponding guideline, developed a selection aid tool that incorporates filtering based on the categorization of subtasks and the degree of freedom of available tracking, and evaluated their effectiveness in two experiments. First, to confirm effects on system design, we asked 18 participants to perform the design action of the AR system with the guideline for two tasks (PC assembly and rope work). Consequently, to verify the quality of the designed AR systems from Experiment 1, we asked another set of 20 participants to perform the same tasks with those systems. The results confirm that using the guideline can considerably lower efforts creating media and alleviate the error for a specific process.

Despite this massive amount of available data, data-driven applications still produce a limited impact on the real world. We argue that this limitation arises from the complexity the developers still face when engineering and deploying solutions on a plurality of embedded devices. Instead of focusing on constructing valuable information from raw data and designing algorithms to exploit it, the developers still have to figure out on their own: how to partition the computation between Edge, Fog, and Cloud; how to move partial results around in highly distributed solutions; how to create abstract interfaces to expose information-rich endpoints. This paper introduces the Virtual Sensor Domain-Specific Language (DSL), which builds the keystone for designing and developing powerful Computer-Aided Design tools and Integrated Development Environments to support the developers in focusing on information manipulation. The Virtual Sensor DSL is built on top of C++ to ease its adoption by the embedded development community. It introduces a reactive approach to data collection, technology mapping, and workload distribution. It allows the creation of adaptable Virtual Sensors, streaming processed information coming from the integration of multiple raw data streams, and it comes with integrated simulation capabilities, supporting prototyping.

Because they are used as examples in an article, these code examples are accompanied by descriptions of their functionality, properties, or other associated information expressed in natural language text. Identifying code segments in these documents is relatively straightforward, thus this paper tackles the problem of extracting the natural language text that is associated with each code segment in an article.

The ML Libraries (MLL) have been classifying by languages implementation and by basic methods specificity. The table “MLL-Features” has been compiling. The features characterize a set of methods, a technique and a task orientation of each library. In total, there are more than 40 such libraries for developing server-side and client-side of knowledge-based Information Systems (KBIS), deep Artificial Neuron Network (ANN), and Natural Language Processing. Most of them are new but are ready for use by developers. As the review one result, it became clear that ML libraries are quite accessible to students and even high school students. The advantage of Web languages is that they are useful both for understanding ready projects and for direct use: only a web browser and development environment are required to run an ML project in JavaScript.

However, with the increasing complexity of modern software systems, distributed development teams, and increasing time pressure for developing these systems, there is a need to collaborate more quickly when building and analyzing models. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced classroom-based software projects to organizational-level software systems to rely on virtual (web-based) collaborative development environments. Therefore, real-time collaborative modelling remains no longer an option but becomes a necessity for MDE too. In our previous work, we introduce a framework, tColab, which uses Eclipse Che workspaces to enable web-based collaborative modelling. However, with real-time collaboration, modelling conflicts can arise and their resolution goes beyond what is possible with the collaborative environment facilitated by an Eclipse Che workspace. In this paper, we extend our tColab framework for building modelling language editors as Visual Studio (VS) Code extensions. These VS Code extensions are well supported by widely used platforms such as VS Code IDE, Eclipse Theia IDE, and the Eclipse Che platform. Furthermore, to facilitate real-time collaboration using these VS Code extensions and to enable conflict-free modelling, we explore two possible solutions – the VS Code Live Share extension and the Teletype CRDTs (conflict-free replicated data types) library. Finally, we provide a prototypical VS Code extension for the TGRL (Textual Goal-oriented Requirement Language) as a proof-of-concept of our extended framework and demonstrate conflict-free collaborative modelling for TGRL using the Live Share extension.","","978-1-6654-2484-4","10.1109/MODELS-C53483.2021.00013","Google; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9643653","User Requirements Notation (URN);Textual Goal-oriented Requirement Language (TGRL);Modelling Conflicts;Language Server Protocol (LSP);Visual Studio (VS) Code extensions;Teletype CRDTs;Eclipse Che;Eclipse Theia","Visualization;Codes;Protocols;Teleprinting;Buildings;Collaboration;Software systems","","6","","33","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to resolve this problem, we need many numbers of servers and networking which are more expensive of buying and which creates more complexity. To resolve this problem we are using the method called cloud computing, it provides IT resources as the service to the user over the internet and can use it on the basis of pay per usage. As it is a researching area of computer network technology, many of huge companies are providing the cloud services. According to the financial perspective, migration of data to the cloud remains trending now a days, but there are several other aspects that must be taken in to consideration before it is decided to do, among them the most important problem is security. Cloud computing security refers to the set of polices, technologies and controls over, applications and infrastructure of cloud computing. This paper tells us how to establish the data confidentiality, availability, security and integrity of shared data in multi cloud environment. So while providing the storage for cloud storage the providers repeatedly make sure the data confidentiality, by encrypting the content of the file by using encryption algorithm and certify the data integrity by cross checking the hash values of the file. Despite, when the cloud storage service fails, the availability of the user data cannot be certified and the cloud sharing function of the user data also cannot be supported. To overcome this users have to give full trust in existing schemes to the provider of the cloud storage service. If the provider system get hacked or becomes untrustworthy, the confidentiality of the user data will be exposed. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a scheme for securely storing and sharing data based on the improved proxy re-encryption algorithm in the multi cloud environment. Here the multi cloud storage is constructed to counter the failure of any single cloud, the symmetric encryption algorithm is used to encrypt the user files. The encryption key is accurately distributed with the Shamir's threshold secret sharing scheme by the general RSA algorithm. Finally the improved proxy re-encryption algorithm is advantage to support the sharing of encrypted user data via clouds. The pattern of the design is performed in the java development environment and is assessed under the assumed multi cloud environment. The experimental results of this design shows that, the time cost of the Shamir's secret partitioning process and symmetric encryption process about be negligible if the key size is greater than the 384 bytes, and the improved proxy re-encryption process takes about 1.5 seconds in an average.","","978-1-5386-2842-3","10.1109/ICCONS.2018.8663034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8663034","Cloud computing;Availability;Security;Confidentiality;Integrity;Data partition;Encrypted data sharing;Improved Proxy re-encryption","Cloud computing;Servers;Encryption;Ciphers;Public key","","","","12","IEEE","10 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The framework defines the components and procedures required to define and execute the benchmarks. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework, we implemented it for a concrete benchmark focused on assessing the performance of a representative application developed by different development tools. For this, we defined a representative set of features for the application and a set of relevant metrics to characterize their performance. The benchmarking campaign is executed on each application in an automated manner. The metrics are collected during the execution of the campaign and the results are then analyzed to compare the applications, their features, and the development tools that produced them. The results show that the same applications implemented in different frameworks are different in terms of software metrics and build time and show different performance when executing different functions (features) in terms of computation time, memory, and CPU usage.

Over time, this data model must be changed in order to accommodate new or changing requirements, and the system components including the data they are operating on must be migrated. In practice, however, not all the affected components can be migrated instantly and at the same time. A common approach is to plan data model changes in a backward compatible fashion, which eventually causes serious maintenance problems and is a common cause of technical debt. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution to this problem by using a translation layer serving as a round-trip migration service which is responsible for the lossless forth-and-back translation of object-oriented data model instances of different versions. We present a framework which offers a version-aware interface definition language (IDL) for APIs, a typed JavaScript-based language for defining migration functions using the IDL definition, and a run-time environment for executing migrations. This is bundled into an integrated development environment assisting developers in implementing migration functions. From a methodological point of view, the development of round-trip migrations is supported by a catalog which comprises a set of typical data model evolution scenarios along with corresponding suitable round-trip migration strategies. We validate our framework by carrying out an extensive evaluation including a systematic assessment of expressiveness using our catalog, micro-benchmarking the performance of round-trip migrations, as well as a practical application in a case study of a real-world e-commerce web application obtained from an industrial partner.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2022.3144613","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9689952","Web services;service data models;web API evolution;model transformations","Data models;Web services;Object oriented modeling;Unified modeling language;Distributed databases;Benchmark testing;Systematics","","2","","56","IEEE","21 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Instead of forcing interested learners or students to install a new operating system and bulky, fragile software onto their personal laptops just to solve tutorials or coding assignments of a single lecture on robotics, it would be beneficial to avoid technical setups and directly dive into the content of cognitive robotics. To achieve this, the authors utilize containerization technologies and Kubernetes to deploy and operate containerized applications, including robotics simulation environments and software collections based on the Robot operating System (ROS).

However, when the cloud storage service fails, the availability of the user data cannot be guaranteed and nor can the cloud sharing function of the user data be supported. In addition, users have to give the provider of the cloud storage service full trust in existing schemes. Once the provider system is hacked or becomes untrustworthy, the confidentiality of the user data will be threatened. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a scheme for securely storing and sharing data based on the proxy re-encryption algorithm in the multi-cloud environment. In this scheme, the multi-cloud storage is designed to prevent the failure of any single cloud, the symmetric encryption algorithm is used to encrypt user files, the encryption key is reliably distributed with the Shamir's threshold secret sharing scheme, and finally the proxy re-encryption algorithm is leveraged to support sharing of the encrypted data via clouds. The prototype of the scheme is implemented in the Java development environment and is evaluated under the simulated multi-cloud environment. Our experimental results show that, the time cost of the Shamir's secret partitioning process and symmetric encryption process almost can be negligible when the key size is as long as 386 bytes, and the proxy re-encryption process takes about 1.6 seconds in average.","","978-1-5090-4499-3","10.1109/ICCCBDA.2017.7951875","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7951875","data partition;encrypted data sharing;proxy re-encryption","Servers;Encryption","","3","","10","IEEE","19 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Can they do the same for helping understand it? In this study, we provide a first investigation of an LLM-based conversational UI built directly in the IDE that is geared towards code understanding. Our IDE plugin queries OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model with four high-level requests without the user having to write explicit prompts: to explain a highlighted section of code, provide details of API calls used in the code, explain key domainspecific terms, and provide usage examples for an API. The plugin also allows for open-ended prompts, which are automatically contextualized to the LLM with the program being edited. We evaluate this system in a user study with 32 participants, which confirms that using our plugin can aid task completion more than web search. We additionally provide a thorough analysis of the ways developers use, and perceive the usefulness of, our system, among others finding that the usage and benefits differ between students and professionals.

Currently, there are many weather stations deployed in the required location but most of them are manual or have a very high cost for installation moreover there are not many weather sensing devices that are pocket-friendly and easy to carry, which can sense data without a live connection solely on basis of a VCC. There are many devices that will sense weather data, store them and send alerts based on analyzed data, but not many devices will sense data solely and provide them to the user. Such devices can be used while traveling in remote areas or to measure the weather parameters of remote/developed areas and display them publicly. Recently, there are no such pocket-friendly devices for the same. This paper aims to measure and analyze real-time weather data. The proposed system attempts to devise an IoT technology that shall detect humidity, temperature, barometric pressure, and rainfall around the location wherein the weather station is fixed. All this data is detected by different sensors that are been mounted on the weather station and after the detection, the data is uploaded on a web page. When the program gets uploaded one can fetch the IP address of Node MCU on the serial monitor of Arduino IDE. The IP address can be pasted on any authorized web browser and present the fetched weather parameters onto the neat GUI. The proposed system was successfully executed and all the parameters were fetched accurately with an accuracy of 95%. The system is pocket-friendly and very easy to use and set up. The system achieves all the objectives successfully and was tested successfully.","","978-1-6654-7451-1","10.1109/IDCIoT56793.2023.10053407","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10053407","Internet of Things;Smart City;Node microcontroller unit (MCU) Esp8266;DHT11: Digital temperature and humidity sensor;BMP 180: Barometric Pressure Sensor;and Rain Sensor FC-37","Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Rain;Atmospheric measurements;Humidity;Sensor systems;IP networks","","5","","15","IEEE","1 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given the faceted nature of many programming tasks, and the incompleteness of the information provided by a single artifact, several heterogeneous resources are required to obtain the broader picture needed by a developer to accomplish a task. We present Libra, a holistic recommender system.

Memory and concurrency bugs do not occur as frequently (6.9 % and 8.8 %), but they consume more debugging time. Locating a bug is more difficult than reproducing and fixing it. Programmers often use only IDE build-in tools for debugging. Furthermore, programmers frequently use a replication-observation-deduction pattern when debugging.

In this paper, a prototype of basic physiological parameter monitoring system based on Arduino and Raspberry Pi microcontroller boards is implemented. Various basic physiological parameters such as blood pressure, heartbeat, oxygen saturation in Blood (SPO2), body temperature and fall detection are measured using relevant sensors and sent to the Arduino microcontroller board for further processing. The computed parameters are then sent to a Raspberry Pi based Web server for display on the web page. ZigBee is used for communication between Arduino and Raspberry Pi. The necessary software is developed using Arduino IDE and Python language. The measured physiological parameters are updated every 60 seconds. The updated parameter values can be viewed from anywhere using an internet enabled device. Also, when the value of the physiological parameters exceeds certain threshold, the caretaker is alerted through SMS.

Many existing IoT services use cloud-based service model. Cloud-based service model conducts logic decision on remote servers, which store public and private information, and leads to security and privacy breakage. Moreover, it limits the users on controlling the services. The tradeoff between data privacy and intelligent service is an important issue on developing IoT services. In this paper, we present a public/private federation framework, which combines public and private intelligence to develop IoT applications. It allows the IoT applications to take advantage of the cloud-based public intelligence and local private data to provide correct services without transmitting private data to public servers. The framework is built on top of an intelligent virtual middleware, named WuKong, to federate with nodeRED, which is a web-enabled flow-based programming environment.

Our goal is to maximize resource utilization with efficient scheduling strategy. There are various scheduling algorithms for performing scheduling of resources based on the needs of the service provider. In our paper we implement Delay time algorithm which is having its efficient significance in scheduling and allocating the resources effectively. We deploy our cloud environment with Cloud Simulator tool and we use Netbeans IDE and Xampp server for processing with our scheduling process.

However, its application to robotics education presents challenges as physical access to hardware is typically required. While educational robotics simulation platforms exist, most are limited in scope or do not facilitate remote collaboration well. This paper proposes a novel networked robotics simulator for education, where students are able to collaborate in a shared 3D virtual space their robots inhabit. The framework combines these simulated worlds with a block-based programming environment to enable distance robotics education for a wider audience. The users' programs run in a web browser on their computers and they issue commands to the virtual robots through a network protocol abstracted to simple-to-use blocks. Robots send back acknowledgements and sensor values through the same protocol. Interactive environments provide students with a more immersive educational experience, and allow for automatically evaluating student performance. In addition to sharing the virtual worlds remotely, students can also develop their programs together since the block-based environment supports both synchronous and asynchronous remote collaboration. The paper presents two scenarios showing a robotics challenge and an extension of the concept to a smart city scenario controlling traffic lights. Reduced barriers to entry for both robotics education and curriculum creation will allow for a more diverse set of students and course materials.","1943-6106","978-1-6654-4592-4","10.1109/VL/HCC51201.2021.9576314","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1835874); National Security Agency(grant numbers:H98230-18-D-0010); Vanderbilt University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9576314","","Visualization;Protocols;Costs;Biological system modeling;Education;Collaboration;Tools","","7","","18","IEEE","29 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Remote Practical Work Environment based on Containers to replace Virtual Machines","L. Yade; A. D. Gueye","TIC4Dev Team-ICT Department, Alioune Diop University, Bambey, Senegal; TIC4Dev Team-ICT Department, Alioune Diop University, Bambey, Senegal",2022 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON),"11 May 2022","2022","","","1285","1290","In this paper, we are interested in solutions to improve remote practical work in the field of computing, more specifically in programming, networks and telecommunications. In the literature, practical work solutions, based on the cloud or on synchronous / asynchronous monitoring and collaboration tools or on shared writing spaces, are proposed to enable practical work to be carried out remotely. However, the cloud based solution, which uses virtual machines, consumes a lot of resources, and therefore brings cumbersome. Each virtual machine contains an image of the operating system, libraries, and applications and can therefore grow very large. The solution based on collaboration tools does not integrate IT development environments, and therefore the programmer resorts to screen shares or basic editors which waste a lot of time when it comes to find certain modules, classes or native functions of the language.In this paper, we propose to replace virtual machines with containers to optimize resources, and provide a collaborative and easy-to-access lab interface. Each user connects to their own workspace provided by the container, which is accessible by the teacher and other learners in the same group. The practical work will be carried out from a web interface connected to the virtual environment via an API. Real-time communication between learners and teachers will be ensured by WebRTC technology.","2165-9567","978-1-6654-4434-7","10.1109/EDUCON52537.2022.9766480","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9766480","remote labs;cloud;virtual machines;docker container;collaboration","Cloud computing;Operating systems;Collaboration;Virtual environments;Containers;Writing;Virtual machining","","3","","23","IEEE","11 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Studies have found that developers can accurately determine whether a string matches a regular expression. However, we still do not know the challenges associated with composing regular expressions. We conduct an exploratory case study to reveal the tools and strategies developers use during regular expression composition. In this study, 29 students are tasked with composing regular expressions that pass unit tests illustrating the intended behavior. The tasks are in Java and the Eclipse IDE was set up with JUnit tests. Participants had one hour to work and could use any Eclipse tools, web search, or web-based tools they desired. Screen-capture software recorded all interactions with browsers and the IDE. We analyzed the videos quantitatively by transcribing logs and extracting personas. Our results show that participants were 30% successful (28 of 94 attempts) at achieving a 100% pass rate on the unit tests. When participants used tools frequently, as in the case of the novice tester and the knowledgeable tester personas, or when they guess at a solution prior to searching, they are more likely to pass all the unit tests. We also found that compile errors often arise when participants searched for a result and copy/pasted the regular expression from another language into their Java files. These results point to future research into making regular expression composition easier for programmers, such as integrating visualization into the IDE to reduce context switching or providing language migration support when reusing regular expressions written in another language to reduce compile errors.","2643-7171","978-1-7281-1519-1","10.1109/ICPC.2019.00039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8813286","Exploratory study;regular expressions;problem solving strategies;personas","","","12","","56","IEEE","29 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In GD-MPI, the basic broadcasting, scattering, and gathering of MPI collective communications is provided. This environment can be extended to include other MPI Standard communications. GD-MPI runs in a web browser and allows users to execute their applications on remote clusters.

Knowledge-driven tutoring systems are needed to improve the cyberlearning quality. One of the major difficulties is knowledge representation. The current industry standard uses Web Ontology Language (OWL) for representing knowledge structure as ontologies. But ontology only supports one “first-class” relation, “is-a”, between the concepts, and different knowledge areas usually need different custom relations to describe the relations among the concepts. For example, “part-of” and time dependency are important relations to represent most engineering knowledge bodies. OWL can only use object properties to emulate such custom relations, leading to awkward knowledge representation hard for instructors to code, validate and use domain knowledge.This research contributes an open-source knowledge-driven online tutoring system framework that is easy to be adapted for the teaching of any subject based on open-source learning objects. Pace University's extension to OWL that supports Knowledge Graph (KG), a generalization of ontology, is used to support knowledge representation with custom relations. The instructors can use Pace University extended Protégé IDE to visually declare custom relations and encode domain knowledge of a course in a single document. The instructor teaching experience is also coded in the KG to better support custom learning order by students with different backgrounds. Integrated assessment after each learning object leads to optimized and adaptive learning order and learning resource recommendation. Students can freely navigate the knowledge space from general to specific or the opposite, or follow unique custom relations. A web technology tutorial is used to validate the design and effectiveness of this tutoring system framework.","0730-3157","978-1-5386-0367-3","10.1109/COMPSAC.2017.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8030018","Knowledge Representation;Learning Objects;Open Source Learning;Adaptive Learning;Intelligent Tutoring Systems","OWL;Ontologies;Open source software;Tutorials;Java","","3","","10","IEEE","11 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since solving these exercises requires access to a programming tool chain, most MOOCs embed their exercises in a web-based environment supplying necessary tools. One of these so-called auto-graders is CodeOcean, which allows learners to write and run code or receive automated feedback. While a web-based auto-grader lowers the entry barrier for learners to get started, providing sufficient resources for all code executions poses an additional challenge for the MOOC provider, especially during high-demand periods. Therefore, we evaluated serverless functions as offered by cloud computing providers for the use in auto-graders and conducted a Randomized Control Trial.

Traditional compile-time error checking, such as calling a non-existent method in Java, are not available for checking whether such requests comply with the requirements of a web API. In this paper, we propose an approach to statically check web API requests in JavaScript. Our approach first extracts a request's URL string, HTTP method, and the corresponding request data using an inter-procedural string analysis, and then checks whether the request conforms to given web API specifications. We evaluated our approach by checking whether web API requests in JavaScript files mined from GitHub are consistent or inconsistent with publicly available API specifications. From the 6575 requests in scope, our approach determined whether the request's URL and HTTP method was consistent or inconsistent with web API specifications with a precision of 96.0%. Our approach also correctly determined whether extracted request data was consistent or inconsistent with the data requirements with a precision of 87.9% for payload data and 99.9% for query data. In a systematic analysis of the inconsistent cases, we found that many of them were due to errors in the client code. The here proposed checker can be integrated with code editors or with continuous integration tools to warn programmers about code containing potentially erroneous requests.","1558-1225","978-1-5386-3868-2","10.1109/ICSE.2017.30","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7985666","Static analysis;JavaScript;Web APIs","Uniform resource locators;Data mining;Reactive power;Payloads;Tools;Media;Writing","","29","2","31","IEEE","20 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the social trends, various web services for the education of programming which improves the computational thinking of a student. Among the web services, block-based programming languages are well known as an effective educational tool for a primary student though a freshman in the university. These tools are proven to be useful tools since the tools provide same programming environment to the students and the teachers anytime and anywhere. However, the environments may be insufficient for learning practical programming languages, such as C/C++ and Java, because they are not the block-based programming languages. This paper introduces a block-based learning environment for C programming language using web services. The environment fills the gap between building computational thinking and learning the syntax of the programming language. The programming environment provides the equivalent environment to teachers and the students during the programming hands-on.","","978-1-5090-0778-3","10.1109/ITHET.2016.7760705","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7760705","web-based instruction;visual programming language;problem-based learning;self-motivated learning","Computer languages;Programming profession;Visualization;Computers;Programming environments;Education","","6","","15","IEEE","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Reflections on the influence of ‘Mica: A programming terminology aid’: 10-Year most influential paper award talk","J. Stylos; B. A. Myers","IBM, Littleton, MA; Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA",2017 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC),"13 Nov 2017","2017","","","7","7","Our paper on “Mica” from the 2006 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing, VL/HCCO6 [1] presented a prototype tool that helped programmers use a description of desired functionality to find specific relevant API classes and methods. Mica worked by using the Google Web APIs to find pages relating to a given query, and then using a list of known API classes and methods to recognize and aggregate the API-relevant words contained in the result pages. Mica used weighted word frequencies to find the API-relevant words correlated with the search and displayed the most relevant words alongside regular web search results. We had observed that when programmers create new software or add functionality to existing software, a common and often difficult task is that of using libraries, toolkits and SDKs to achieve the desired functionality. Internet search engines, in particular Google, have emerged as new and effective tools for this task, providing quick access to a large collection of tutorials and example code. However, our observations of how programmers used these resources revealed problems and inefficiencies in their use as programming tools. Mica was the first of long series of tools that we built as part of the “Natural Programming Project” [2] to help programmers more easily use APIs. We speculate that the impact of the Mica paper is because: ·The problem of helping users find and use the right API from a growing number of available options has become increasingly relevant. ·The data that comes from other developers' experience, found and ranked through web search, continues to be an invaluable starting point for finding and figuring out how to use APIs. · The strategy of extracting and displaying relevant information alongside Google search results has proven effective. Since Mica came out Google and Bing have started to support this pattern for movies, people, events, and many other pieces of information, although not yet APIs. ·That sweet logo!","1943-6106","978-1-5386-0443-4","10.1109/VLHCC.2017.8103443","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8103443","Programming help systems;search;Google;examples;Natural Programming","Visualization;Programming;Google","","","","2","IEEE","13 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This specific area has been overlooked; the information is disorganized, it can be found only manually and at the same time it can be lost. By taking these into account, we considered that is crucial to systematize records of birds' information through building in agile way a web application system. It will contribute to better organizing, classification, and management of information for all the interested parties. Therefore, this research represents the development of a web application system for birds' monitoring. Through the management of software processes, it aims to generate a scientific database that allows users to interact in real time. For a quick and agile development, was applied SCRUM methodology. In addition, PHP programming tools and MySql database construction were used to simplify the writing process of the web application.

Witt takes as input a phrase describing a software technology or concept and returns a general category that describes it (e.g., integrated development environment), along with attributes that further qualify it (commercial, php, etc.). By extension, the approach enables the dynamic creation of lists of all technologies of a given type (e.g., web application frameworks). Our approach relies on Stack Overflow and Wikipedia, and involves numerous original domain adaptations and a new solution to the problem of normalizing automatically-detected hypernyms. We compared Witt with six independent taxonomy tools and found that, when applied to software terms, Witt demonstrated better coverage than all evaluated alternative solutions, without a corresponding degradation in false positive rate.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2018.2836450","Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8359344","Taxonomy;information retrieval;natural language processing;Wikipedia;tagging","Software;Encyclopedias;Electronic publishing;Internet;Taxonomy;Tools","","12","","46","IEEE","15 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A myriad collection of software and hardware frameworks has been developed to alleviate some of the technical barriers involved in EEG-driven research. Methods: we propose an integrated development environment which encompasses the entire technical “data-collection pipeline” of cognitive-neuropsychological research, including experiment design, data acquisition, data exploration and analysis in a state-of-the-art user interface. Our framework is based on a unique integration between a python-based web framework, time-oriented databases and object-based data schemes. Results: we demonstrated our framework with the recording and analysis of an n-Back task completed by 15 elderly (ages 50 to 80) participants. This case study demonstrates the highly utilized nature of our integrated framework with a challenging target population. Furthermore, our results may provide new insights into the correlation between brain activity and working memory performance in elderly people, who are prone to experience accelerated decline in executive prefrontal cortex functioning.

For instructors, it is a useful tool for creating assignments and exams. However, selecting problems in POJs is time consuming. First, problems are generally not organized based on topics covered in the CS1 syllabus. Second, assessing whether problems require similar effort to be completed and map onto the same topic is a subjective and expert-dependent task. The difficulty increases if the instructor must create variations of these assessments, e.g., to avoid plagiarism. Thus, here, we research how to support CS1 instructors in the task of selecting problems, to compose one-size-fits-all or personalized assignments/exams. Our solution is to propose a novel intelligent recommender system, based on a fine-grained data-driven analysis of the students' effort on solving problems in the integrated development environment of a POJ system, and automatic detection of topics for CS1 problems, based on problem descriptions. Data collected from 2714 students are processed to support, via our artificial intelligence (AI) method recommendations, the instructors' decision-making process. We evaluated our method against the state of the art in a simple blind experiment with CS1 instructors ($N =$ 35). Results show that our recommendations are 88% accurate, surpassing our baseline ($p<$ 0.05).

Stochastic modeling with Performance Evaluation Process Algebra (PEPA) has been used to evaluate the robustness of static resource allocations in parallel and distributed computing systems. These evaluations have previously been performed through the PEPA Plug-In for the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment and have been limited by factors that include: i) the size and complexity of the underlying, in-use PEPA model, ii) a small number of resource allocation models available for analysis, and iii) the human interaction necessary to configure the PEPA Eclipse Plug-In, thus limiting potential automation. As the size and complexity of the underlying PEPA models increases, the number of states to be evaluated for each model also greatly increases, leading to a case of state space explosion. In this work, we validate the Imperial PEPA Compiler (IPC) as a replacement for the PEPA Eclipse Plug-In for the robustness analysis of resource allocations. We make available an implementation of the IPC as a Singularity container, as part of a larger online repository of PEPA resources. We then develop and test a programmatic method for generating PEPA models for resource allocations. When combined with our IPC container, this method allows automated analysis of resource allocation models at scale. The use of the IPC allows the evaluation of larger models than it is possible when using the PEPA Eclipse Plug-In. Moreover, the increases in scale in both model size and number of models, support the development of improved makespan targets for robustness metrics, including those among applications subject to perturbations at runtime, as found in typical parallel and distributed computing environments.","2379-5352","978-1-7281-8946-8","10.1109/ISPDC51135.2020.00018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9201628","Process algebra;Robustness analysis;Performance modeling;Performance evaluation;Application virtualization;Scalabilty;Stochastic processes","Computational modeling;Robustness;Resource management;Analytical models;Complexity theory;Runtime;Algebra","","1","","37","IEEE","22 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, a traditional integrated development environment seldom analyzes functional test program weaknesses regarding fault-masking and propagation in CPU registers. Therefore, understanding the presence of errors in the programs due to logic faults at the end of the test program is only assessed by a signature computation, e.g., xor operation between all registers. The presence of program weaknesses in terms of data or control flow is not assessed, and it may lead to fault escapes and/or masking. In particular, those are perfect conditions for proliferating Silent data corruption and unrecoverable errors at the system level.This work aims to introduce a guided debugger-based fault injector framework to verify the fault propagation and masking capabilities of functional test programs by eventually catching program errors without relying on time-consuming simulation-based approaches. The fault-free instruction trace is dumped and analyzed to provide information about possible target registers of specific instructions for injecting faults, e.g., in jump instructions, where errors into registers may change the execution flow or not, to verify the presence of silent data corruptions and errors.The experimental results are carried out on an automotive device from the SPC58 family manufactured by STMicroelectronics, and faults are injected through a script running on Power Debug E40 from Lauterbach.","2375-1053","979-8-3503-4630-5","10.1109/VTS56346.2023.10140099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10140099","Debugger-injector;automotive SoC;fault-injection;functional test programs evaluations;silent-data corruption;errors evaluation","Analytical models;Codes;Computational modeling;Very large scale integration;Software;Libraries;Registers","","","","13","IEEE","2 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Applying Computational Intelligence for enhancing the dependability of multi-cloud systems using Docker Swarm","N. Naik","Ministry of Defence, Defence School of Communications and Information Systems, United Kingdom",2016 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI),"13 Feb 2017","2016","","","1","7","Multi-cloud systems have been gaining popularity due to the several benefits of the multi-cloud infrastructure such as lower level of vendor lock-in and minimize the risk of widespread data loss or downtime. Thus, the multi-cloud infrastructure enhances the dependability of the cloud-based system. However, it also poses many challenges such as nonstandard and inherent complexity due to different technologies, interfaces, and services. Consequently, it is a challenging task to design multi-cloud dependable systems. Virtualization is the key technology employed in the development of cloud-based systems. Docker has recently introduced its container-based virtualization technology for the development of software systems. It has newly launched a distributed system development tool called Swarm, which allows the development of a cluster of multiple Swarm nodes on multiple clouds. Docker Swarm has also incorporated several dependability attributes to support the development of a multi-cloud dependable system. However, making Swarm cluster always available requires minimum three active manager nodes which can safeguard one failure. This essential condition for the dependability is one of the main limitations because if two manager nodes fail suddenly due to the failure of their hosts, then Swarm cluster cannot be made available for routine operations. Therefore, this paper proposes an intuitive approach based on Computational Intelligence (CI) for enhancing its dependability. The proposed CI-based approach predicts the possible failure of the host of a manager node by observing its abnormal behaviour. Thus, this indication can automatically trigger the process of creating a new manager node or promoting an existing node as a manager for enhancing the dependability of Docker Swarm.","","978-1-5090-4240-1","10.1109/SSCI.2016.7850194","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7850194","Computational Intelligence;CI;Fuzzy Inference;Dependability;Docker Swarm;Multi-Cloud;Container;Virtual Machine;VM;Availability","Containers;Cloud computing;Virtualization;Fuzzy reasoning;Virtual machining;Reliability;Engines","","21","","33","IEEE","13 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These interactive sessions were led by a moderator inquiring the resource panel on topics related to the content of the lecture. This was done in the same spirit on how a panel discussion would be conducted led by a moderator in a conference. Microsoft Teams Live was used in the delivery of the content to an audience of up to 800 students. Delivering a freshers programming course is known to be challenging in face- to-face delivery. A collaborative programming environment was used to engage students in live coding activities during the lectures. Students had opportunities to interact with the resource panel through quizzes, QA and through coding related activities. These lectures also introduced the innovative use of QR codes to get students engagement through a mobile device for the interactive sessions.

Story from the internet resource can be a long story or a short story. For the former, it needs to make a summary to become shorter. When it is a long one, it is more difficult to tell our kids and it is more relevant to make a summary. For creating a summary, it will be easier to proceed with a computer, consequently, it needs a computer application that automatically provides a short overview of the folklore. The Indonesian folklore is summarized by several processes in a web application with a python programming language as a development tool. The process of summarization begins with processing the text that is entered by the user and it is eliminated in all of the special characters. Then the result is processed in the form of tokenizing to get a set of words. From this process, all of the set’s elements that are belong to the stop word list are removed and then the rest of them are counted each for the word frequency that they appear. After finding the word frequency, the sentences are scored by the accumulation of word frequency that they have and are sorted based on this score. Lastly, the sentences are sorted based on each of them appear from the original version and make them be a single paragraph. The result of this research is that text summarization can be carried out with the computer application and python programming languages in the form of a website. The number of sentences that are determined can be selected by the user in the program. Several Indonesian folklores are applied to the application and rated by the reader. Moreover, the application delivers 87% of reader acceptance and it is almost similar to several existing online websites that generate text summary.","","978-1-7281-7109-8","10.1109/EECCIS49483.2020.9263466","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9263466","word frequency;summarization;Indonesian folklore;python","Python;Text mining;Lakes;Informatics;Seminars;Power electronics;Java","","","","9","IEEE","23 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The blockchain structure removes the barriers of a traditional centralized federation and offers a fully distributed and transparent administration by enforcing the involved agents to maintain consensus on the data. For a blockchain-based federation, it is vital to avoid blind-trust on the claimed SLA guarantees and monitor the quality of service which is highly desirable considering the multi-tenancy characteristic of cloud services. Due to the fact that the blockchain network is unable to access the outside world, it cannot handle, by its own, providers misbehavior in terms of SLA violations. Thus, we introduce oracle as a verifier agent to monitor the quality of the service and report to the smart contract agents deployed on the blockchain. Oracle is a trusted third-party agent who can communicate with the outside world of the blockchain network. The interaction between cloud service providers (either providing a service or requesting it from another provider) and the oracle through smart contracts comprises a system of autonomous and utility maximizer agents. Cloud requesters seek to receive high quality services with constant monitoring at cheap prices or even with no charge, while cloud providers aim to have a balanced work-load with less preserved capacity, and the oracle tends to charge higher for their monitoring services. Therefore, to model this conflicting situation, we formulate a dynamic Stackelberg differential game to optimize the cost of using the oracle and maximize the profit of the agents with the role of provider agent as a leader, and the requester and verifier agents as followers. Our designed Stackelberg differential game can seize the dynamicity of users' demand and resource provisioning in a competitive cloud market. We implemented our proposed decentralized model using the Solidity language in the remix IDE on the Ethereum network. We further evaluated the optimal controls and agents' profit with real-world data simulated for three concrete cloud providers. The results revealed that the requester agent initiates most of the quality verification requests at the beginning to the middle time of the contract. Thus, the provider agent could reserve less computing resources considering the fact that it could share the workload among other customers' computing resources during the peak-time. Moreover, imposing a higher penalty on the provider agent increased the capacity and decreased the number of requests for quality verification at the equilibrium. The evaluation also disclosed that the impact of timing in the dynamic pricing strategy of the verifier agent is very minimal, and the provisioning capacity of the provider is strongly correlated with the monitoring price.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2019.2948010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8873576","Smart contracts;quality verification;stackleberg differential game;cloud computing;service provider;oracle","Cloud computing;Monitoring;Blockchain;Smart contracts;Games;Quality of service","","12","","33","IEEE","17 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The SDR environment is generally configured with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and a personal computer (PC). However, since ADCs and PCs are fixed configurations, reconfigurations are needed in order to respond to different data sources and computing environments when the radio protocol or SDR are indefinite. To enable this reconfiguration, we present a cloud platform that has scalable computing resources and data sources deployed in a wide area, using an existing SDR development environment. In order to apply the existing SDR development environment to the cloud platform, UI separation and data management are required. In this manuscript, we implement an SDR environment for many unspecified users through UI separation by selecting the GNU Radio Companion (GRC) as the platform. We focused on compatibility and flexibility with regard to the configuration, in order to allow the user to adjust the resources consumed by the PC. The results show that one particular implementation of the remote SDR execution and development is suitable. In addition, we confirmed the compatibility with GRC in terms of user skills and software assets, and achieved distributed processing to allocate resources between the client and cloud according to the user's discretion, by dividing the processing of the SDR on the basis of the function unit.","","978-1-5090-0676-2","10.1109/APCC.2016.7581497","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7581497","GNU Radio;software-defined radio;cloud","Computers;Cloud computing;Distributed processing;Signal processing;Sensors;Graphical user interfaces","","2","","14","IEEE","6 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a code base grows over time, it is natural that the libraries become stale and require updates in order to sustain innovation. Nonetheless, updating a library comes at a cost; it can potentially introduce breaking changes in the code. Thus it may require a large portion of developer time for maintenance. To alleviate this, we propose to use artificial intelligence to parse release notes documentation and automatically recommend code updates to become compatible with new versions. The solution comes in the form of an IDE plugin that can automatically detect deprecated library usages in live code bases and suggest the recommended fixes in a user-friendly way. The system architecture is comprised of three components: a web crawler that sources and pre-processes library deprecation texts, a deprecations parser that transforms those texts into a structured form, and an IDE plugin that finds and updates the parsed deprecations in a code base. In order to validate our approach, we collect and annotate a dataset of 426 API deprecations from 7 popular Python libraries and obtain an overall average weighted subtree overlap of 31.3 and 45.9 on method deprecations. Finally, we demo our tool in the form of a plugin for the industry leading Python IDE PyCharm and test it on 33 internal repositories at J.P Morgan Chase.","2576-3148","979-8-3503-2783-0","10.1109/ICSME58846.2023.00068","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10336306","software engineering;library deprecations;automatic code update","Technological innovation;Software maintenance;Codes;Source coding;Knowledge based systems;Systems architecture;Transforms","","","","7","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The authors discuss the challenges faced in teaching-learning cloud computing technology and the method followed to overcome these. The two main challenges are designing the course content and adopting suitable open source infrastructure tools for hands-on experience. The authors have put efforts in adoption and usage of cloud computing in undergraduate engineering level by proposing a modified Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). This model helped to identify different parameters/attributes to improve academic performance. An activity-based laboratory course is designed in line with the theory course. All the activities are implemented using the open source software environment. The activities planned in the course are assessed based on the outcome based evaluation. The graduate attribute addressed in the course are domain knowledge gain in cloud computing concepts, problem-solving, usage of modern tools and life-long learning. The average attainment of the stated graduate attribute is 77.89% in the course internal semester assessment.

Various applications for mobile banking, travel ticket booking, and health monitoring are making life easier and more convenient. With the use of mobile phones and their applications, we have entered a digital age where almost everything is available at our fingertips. A major task for mobile app developers is to choose the correct tool for developing apps. There are three basic technologies i.e. Native, Web, and Hybrid for developing mobile apps. The choice of mobile app development tool or technology will depend on the specific needs of the project. Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses, and developers must consider factors such as budget, timeline, and performance requirements when selecting a development approach. The most outstanding performance and user experience are provided by native apps, but their development can be costly and time-consuming. Web applications are the least expensive and easiest to develop, but they may not offer the same level of performance or access to device features as native or hybrid apps. Hybrid apps offer an acceptablecompromise between performance and development costs. In this paper, we mainly focus on different mobile app development tools and techniques e.g. React Native, Flutter, Ionic, Xamarin, and programming languages used e.g. HTML, CSS, and J avaScript along with their applications and limitations.

However, most restrict access to the outside world, limiting learners to commands and computing resources built in to the environment. Some allow learners to drag and drop files, connect to sensors and robots locally or issue HTTP requests. But in a world where most of the applications in our daily lives are distributed (i.e., their functionality depends on communicating with other programs or accessing resources and data on the internet), the lack of support for beginners to envision and create such distributed programs is a lost opportunity. This paper argues that it is not only feasible, but crucial, to create environments with simple yet powerful abstractions that open up distributed computing and other widely used but advanced computing concepts including networking, the Internet of Things, and cybersecurity to novices. By thus removing the walls around our environments, we can expand opportunities for learning considerably: programs can access a wealth of online data and web services, and communicate with other projects. Moreover, these changes can enable young learners to collaborate with each other during program construction whether they share their physical location or study remotely. Importantly, providing access to the wider world will also help counter widespread student perceptions that block-based environments are mere toys, and show that they are capable of creating compelling applications. The paper presents NetsBlox, a programming environment that supports these ideas and shows that tools can be designed to democratize access to powerful ideas in computing.","1943-6106","978-1-6654-4592-4","10.1109/VL/HCC51201.2021.9576399","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1835874); National Security Agency(grant numbers:H98230-18-D-0010); Computational Thinking and Learning Initiative of Vanderbilt University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9576399","","COVID-19;Visualization;Codes;Educational robots;Web services;Toy manufacturing industry;Distributed databases","","3","","26","IEEE","29 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of the right data structure improves the performance of algorithms and increases time and space efficiency.Data structures involve the usage of pointers and references for representing user’s data. It is very difficult for new users/learners to see how these pointers and references change. It is also very difficult to find a correlation between the program being executed and the data structure being used in the code.Immersive understanding and involved learning are enabled by visualisation of these data structures. As a result, the user can appreciate the way the pointers and references are used in data structures.The aim of Code-Viz is to provide data structure specific visualisations and animations that are both intuitive and accurate. The tool is language agnostic, supporting major programming languages (currently C and Python).

It provides massive storage capabilities, the development environment for application developers through virtual machines.

As security is the main constraint holding companies to engage into the cloud fully, third-party auditors (TPA) are becoming more and more common in cloud computing implementations. Of course, involving auditors comes with its issues such as trust and processing overhead. To achieve productive auditing, we need to (1) accomplish efficient auditing without requesting the data location, nor introducing processing overhead to the cloud client; (2) avoid involving new security vulnerabilities during the auditing process. In this paper, we propose a novel method allowing to detect a dishonest TPA: the Light-weight Accountable Privacy Preserving (LAPP) Protocol. This protocol determines the malicious behavior of the TPA. To validate the proposed protocol's effectiveness, simulation experiments have been conducted, using the GreenCloud simulator. Based on our simulation results, we confirm that our proposed protocol provides better outcomes as compared to the other known contending protocols concerning reliability, communication cost, and the auditing time per task by a fraction of the invalid responses.","2158-4001","978-1-5386-3025-9","10.1109/ICCE.2018.8326350","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8326350","public auditing;light-weight privacy preserving (LAPP);third party auditor (TPA);cloud client (CC);cloud service provider (CSP);security and privacy of storage (SPS);panda public auditing (PPA);privacy-preserving public auditing (PPPAS);secure and efficient privacy-preserving public auditing (SEPPPA)","Cloud computing;Protocols;Cryptography;Privacy;Stakeholders;Testing","","4","","12","IEEE","29 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, there is a need for a smart charging system to reduce the challenges of locating charging station and checking slot availability. The primary objective of the project is to design and implement an EV charger featuring a rectifier circuit with Power Factor Correction (PFC) controller using a flyback converter topology. Additionally, a web application for EV charging station ""ChargEVfy"" has been developed. This application aims to assist EV drivers in identifying nearby charging stations. Once a charging station is located, users have an option to check available charging slots and even reserve a slot in advance for their vehicle by registering on ""ChargEVfy"" website. The web application provides an option whereby the users can input their starting point and destination. Subsequently, the webpage displays a roadmap with all accessible charging stations along the journey.

For this reason, researchers have begun to seek approaches for automatically repairing record/replay tests. To date, however, there have been no comprehensive attempts to characterize the causes of breakagesin record/replay tests for web applications. In this work, wepresent a taxonomy classifying the ways in which record/replay tests for web applications break, based on an analysis of 453 versions of popular web applications for which 1065 individual test breakages were recognized. The resulting taxonomy can help direct researchers in their attempts to repair such tests. It can also help practitioners by suggesting best practices when creating tests or modifying programs, and can help researchers with other tasks such as test robustness analysis and IDE design.","","978-1-5090-1827-7","10.1109/ICST.2016.16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7515470","Record/replay testing;web applications;test breakages;test repair","Taxonomy;HTML;Maintenance engineering;Selenium;Web pages;Testing;Frequency measurement","","33","","47","IEEE","21 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Point clouds generated by 3D scanning tools are not well suited to robot motion planning due to their complexity. However, algorithms that generate a simplified model from a point cloud exist and improve collision detection performance.

To achieve this goal, some form of air and sound pollution tracking machine needs to be developed. To counter the hassle of air and sound pollutants tracking, we advocate a Raspberry Pi and IOT primarily based air and sound pollution monitoring machine project. To measure the air and noise pollutants degrees, the monitoring device employs a CO2 sensor, a methane sensor, and a microphone. The measured sensor information is then transmitted to a remote net server through a WI-FI connection. By effective monitoring of pollutants levels, measures may be taken to bring those levels down. Sensor module can analyze and decide the percentage of the toxic gases present in the surroundings and might immediately terminate the output protocol. Fuel sensors are used to acquire records from air and sent to Arduino IDE. The statistics is sent to cloud through Arduino IDE with the help of WI-FI module.

To find help, programmers often take to online question-and-answer forums such as Stack Overflow to start discussion threads about the errors they encountered.Aims: We conjecture that information from Stack Overflow threads which discuss compiler errors can be automatically collected and repackaged to provide programmers with enhanced compiler error messages, thus saving programmers' time and energy.Method: We present Pycee, a plugin integrated with the popular Sublime Text IDE to provide enhanced compiler error messages for the Python programming language. Pycee automatically queries Stack Overflow to provide customised and summarised information within the IDE. We evaluated two Pycee variants through a think-aloud user study during which 16 programmers completed Python programming tasks while using Pycee.Results: The majority of participants agreed that Pycee was helpful while completing the study tasks. When compared to a baseline relying on the official Python documentation to enhance compiler error messages, participants generally preferred Pycee in terms of helpfulness, citing concrete suggestions for fixes and example code as major benefits.Conclusions: Our results confirm that data from online sources such as Stack Overflow can be successfully used to automatically enhance compiler error messages. Our work opens up venues for future work to further enhance compiler error messages as well as to automatically reuse content from Stack Overflow for other aspects of programming.","1949-3789","978-1-7281-2968-6","10.1109/ESEM.2019.8870155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8870155","Compiler errors;Stack Overflow;think-aloud","Python;Program processors;Task analysis;Programming;Syntactics;Message systems;Cryptography","","10","1","50","IEEE","17 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are often repetitions of those implementations in the development process so that a large number of code writings are required. A GraphQL-based backend service development tool for CRUD operations, authentication, and authorization is proposed. This tool was created with the aim of reducing the code writings required for developers to implement CRUD operations, authentication, and authorization systems. GraphQL is used as the query language to access and manipulate data because GraphQL has a schema that can be utilized to define model data and the metadata needed. JSON Web Token (JWT) is chosen as the authentication method because JWT is one of the authentication methods that has a subject context used by the authorization method. Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is used as the authorization method because ABAC can validate up to the attribute level so it can handle many system requirements. The result is a GraphQL-based backend service development tool for CRUD operations, authentication, and authorization called Homura. The following results were obtained: (1) The GraphQL API server was successfully created using Homura based on the definition of CRUD operations, data model, authentication, and authorization, and (2) Homura succeeded in reducing the number of code writings required by 82%.","2640-0227","979-8-3503-9705-5","10.1109/ICoDSE56892.2022.9971818","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9971818","authentication;authorization;attribute-based access control;CRUD operations;GraphQL","Authorization;Codes;Authentication;Writing;Metadata;Servers;Database languages","","","","4","IEEE","15 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the on-line monitoring and fault diagnosis of transformers are particularly important in practical applications. The traditional maintenance method is called regular maintenance. This maintenance method is to call a large number of inspection workers at regular intervals to carry out large-scale inspections, not only to collect various working data of the transformer, but also to observe its working status, and finally manually. Check whether there are hidden dangers in major machines, and judge whether the transformer can run safely and stably according to the data obtained by these large amounts of manpower and material resources. In order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of transformer fault diagnosis, and to carry out all-round real-time online monitoring and fault diagnosis of 220kV power transformers, considering the actual needs of electricity companies, this paper is based on the Qt development platform, C++, MySQL and other development environments. And developed a transformer online monitoring and intelligent diagnosis system, which mainly has the functions of providing basic information management, online monitoring, fault diagnosis, giving operation and maintenance suggestions, and providing users with visual comprehensive analysis. Tested with actual data, it is proved that the system can objectively reflect the operating state of the transformer and carry out real-time fault diagnosis. The system designed in this paper meets the needs of operators to understand the status of distribution transformers, and effectively solves the problem of untimely detection of distribution transformer faults. It can effectively improve the efficiency of detection, reduce the probability of major accidents, and reduce operation and maintenance costs., which saves financial and human resources, and is of great significance for improving economic efficiency and personal and equipment safety.","","978-1-83953-851-3","10.1049/icp.2023.0118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10137695","","","","","","","","29 May 2023","","","IET","IET Conferences"

This web application helps farmers better understand the requirement of water content in the soil which will eventually help in better irrigation followed by better crop production. The web application comprises three display sections, each displaying temperature, moisture & humidity values, and a manual button has been included for scenarios when there is an abundance of water due to rainfall. In such cases, alerts will be generated and the farmer can dig a way for excess water removal. The temperature sensor values are further processed for filtering out the noise by performing the Kalman Filter technique using Processing IDE application by Arduino.

Two approaches for transformation of the robot into IoT device have been designed and tested. In the first, MQTT protocol has been deployed on the robot side that can use local or remote MQTT broker. In the second approach, there is no need to install specific publish-subscribe client software for interactions with the broker. Instead, continuous python process in Node-RED accesses the Pepper internal memory for storing and retrieving key-value pairs.

Nevertheless, the acquisition of programming skills is not an easy task. This fact is corroborated by the literature that report alarming failure and dropout rates in CS0 (Introduction to Computer Science) courses. On the other hand, forecasts about the demand for software developers indicate exponential growth over the next decade.In this context, reducing the cognitive workload for learners is desirable. For instance, the integration of a web-based environment with some visual programming tool and automatic assessment could benefit learners.The adoption of a unique environment where the students could learn how to solve problems using algorithms and receive immediate feedback may reduce the slope of the learning curve. Moreover, the possibility of using the same tool to communicate with their teachers and colleagues can positively affect their learning.Also, the visual programming paradigm can reduce the need for memorization of a programming language syntax. It allows learners to focus their attention on solving the problem algorithmically.There are several tools that provide automated assessment evaluation. Some of these can be used with Web browsers, but very few of them can be integrated with a Learning Management System (LMS). In this workshop, we will discuss two of these systems that are distributed as free software: the Virtual Programming Laboratory (VPL) and the iVProgH/iAssign solutions. They can all be integrated with the Moodle platform.Since VPL demands an extra installation of the jail server (to run students solutions) and works with traditional programming languages, the focus will be over iVProgH/iAssign.

Task scheduling in cloud computing is the process of organizing the user task and allocating it with the suitable and available resources so that the available resources will be properly used and scheduling will be done effectively. There are numerous task scheduling techniques. This paper presents an alternative approach to task scheduling problem. It mainly focused on the time utilization and resource monitoring. The proposed method is Enhanced Resource Monitor and Scheduler (ERMS) which focus on both monitoring of available resources and scheduling of user task.Periodic push action method is used to get the status of virtual machine. The fitness value is calculated and scheduling is done. The process is implemented using ClouldSim 3.0 Simulator in NetBeans IDE.","2576-9065","978-1-7281-0837-7","10.1109/ICCPEIC45300.2019.9082358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9082358","Cloud Computing;Task Scheduling;Enhanced Resource Monitor and Scheduler Algorithm;Periodic push action Technique","","","","","10","IEEE","30 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For smart contract developers to understand and trust code execution, they need to write and use software libraries with a comprehensible code representation-i.e., source code. However, blockchains do not typically store the original source code of smart contracts, but a con-densed bytecode representation. Thus, when developers consult smart contract source code, they need to be sure that it corresponds to the same bytecode on the blockchain. Depending on available developer tools, this process can be ad-hoc, cumbersome, or opaque. In this paper we present our design and implementation of a new tool that serves to verify Move smart contract source code against its bytecode representation on the Sui blockchain. We demonstrate the user-facing shift where developers now benefit from seeing source code in their browser instead of bytecode. We further high-light future features and research directions that verified source availability brings to smart contract developer experience.","2574-1934","979-8-4007-0502-1","10.1145/3639478.3640038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10554938","smart contracts;source code;bytecode;compilers;program comprehension;software development;blockchain","Productivity;Codes;Software libraries;Source coding;Ergonomics;Smart contracts;Ecosystems","","","","12","","20 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite their growing popularity, existing challenges in employing these technologies have not been documented, and it is hard for individuals and companies to weigh benefits and pros against drawbacks and cons.In this paper, we address this issue by investigating the challenges that developers frequently experience when adopting desktop web app frameworks. To achieve this goal, we mine and apply topic modeling techniques to a dataset of 10,822 Stack Overflow posts related to the development of desktop web applications. Analyzing the resulting topics, we found that: i) developers often experience issues regarding the build and deployment processes for multiple platforms; ii) reusing existing libraries and development tools in the context of desktop applications is often cumbersome; iii) it is hard to solve issues that arise when interacting with native APIs. Furthermore, we confirm our finding by providing evidence that the identified issues are also present in the issue reports of 453 open-source applications publicly hosted on GitHub.","2574-3864","978-1-7281-8710-5","10.1109/MSR52588.2021.00039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463138","Web technologies;Desktop apps;Stack Over-flow;GitHub;Topic modeling","Knowledge engineering;Companies;Tools;Libraries;Data mining;Open source software;Software development management","","5","","45","IEEE","28 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accordingly, in this study, a Web-based Visualized OOP Learning Tool (VLT-OOP), is designed and developed to facilitate the OOP concepts learning. VLT-OOP visualizes the important and abstract concepts of OOP, i.e., Class, Object, Method, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism, to assist students in visually understanding the meaning through the developments of 2D graphical Web-based applications using the visualized objects and operations.

Being designed to be suitable for application to the widest possible number of web technologies, such guidelines are often perceived as hard to understand, not suitable for practical problem solving, and under some circumstances even not really useful in order to develop an accessible website or application.As a consequence, many accompanying resources have been proposed to support developers in understanding accessibility guidelines and applying them to their projects, as well as a variety of testing tools to let them check the presence of accessibility issues in their code and provide guidance in fixing them. Yet, most web content available on the Inter.net still exhibit critical accessibility issues.In our opinion, this approach is non satisfactory, as the personal understanding of the developers is always mediated by written reports and indirect information that are not immediately understandable and actionable. In this paper we propose our approach to increase integration between development tools and accessibility testing tools in usual web development workflows.

These tags can indicate different sections and subsections in the structure of a page. We harness the existing familiarity of blind computer users with this interface in our approach which we call AudioHighlight. AudioHighlight renders the code inside a web view, either as part of the Eclipse IDE or as a web service. It places HTML heading tags on the structural elements of a source file such as classes, functions and control flow statements. We compare AudioHighlight to the state of the art in code skimming represented by a previous code skimming approach called StructJumper. We also compare to the state of practice in reading code on the web as represented by GitHub. We found that AudioHighlight increased the quality and speed of code comprehension as compared to both approaches.","2576-3148","978-1-5386-7870-1","10.1109/ICSME.2018.00030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8530030","accessibility;visual impairments;program comprehension","Navigation;Task analysis;Licenses;Syntactics;Productivity;Tutorials;Cloning","","12","","40","IEEE","11 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The InSECTS digital architecture was developed to support NASA/JHU-APL Dragonfly autonomous software development and proliferated space-based containerized processing at Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering. Processing needs for deep space, scientific, and National Security spacecraft software are continually evolving to support exceedingly diverse mission requirements. As a result of this evolution, Spacecraft software engineers require a pathway for rapidly testing, updating, and deploying software to on-orbit cloud processing clusters in an economical and responsible way. InSECTS supports this need by providing a low-cost prototype of an on-orbit processing architecture affording developers the capability to test and deploy cloud-based software to operational spacecraft, while mitigating the risks involved with traditional space system development. The InSECTS digital architecture supports any open-source initiative compliant containerized application on a hardware agnostic distributed Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) computing environment. Additionally, by utilizing preexisting container orchestration software the environment is inherently redundant across multiple independent processing suites. Finally, InSECTS design is configurable which allows it to function as a payload on a small satellite or as its own microsatellite. The InSECTS cloud-agnostic ground system is accessible with Internet of Things (IoT) devices and has a Development Operations (DEVOPS) pipeline that supports open-source software code development. This gives engineers and researchers building software the ability to write, integrate, and deploy software containers into the InSECTS environment using development tools broadly accessible across the industry. To verify these technical solutions, an InSECTS prototype was demonstrated at Johns Hopkins University by deploying an autonomy software cluster able to control a thermal control system model designed after the NASA/APL Dragonfly thermonuclear generator. As a result of this successful test, further InSECTS development at Johns Hopkins is planned and may include a functional small satellite for on-orbit testing.

Traditional English CAI (Computer-Assisted Instruction) does not pay enough attention to the differences among students in teaching and cannot provide more comprehensive services. In the traditional LTSA (Learning Technology Systems Architecture) framework, the relationship between teachers and resources is dominant, while the relationship between learners and resources is ignored. The MOOC system can balance the relationship between teachers, learners, and teaching resources, and can automatically push personalized learning plans and develop one-on-one learning methods based on students' mastery of knowledge and their own strengths, thereby helping students improve learning efficiency. With the development of the times, more and more people are using MOOC systems, but the current GLR (Generalized Likelihood Ratio) algorithm's system running speed is not fast enough and accurate enough to effectively formulate personalized plans for people. What this paper studies is to improve the GLR algorithm to improve the running speed of the system, better design personalized learning programs for people, and develop and design a Business English MOOC system. This system uses Idea as the development tool and MySQL as the database, using the current mainstream development framework technology SpringBoot and improving the GLR algorithm to enhance system functionality. Experiments have shown that the MOOC system can indeed strengthen the connection between learners and resources and improve learners' learning efficiency. According to the proposed learner behavior evaluation model formula, the score of the MOOC system is 10 points higher than the traditional method, and the improved algorithm improves the accuracy of personalized schemes by about 10% compared to the previous one, reducing the time spent by nearly half. The improved GLR algorithm can not only accelerate the speed of formulating personalized plans, but also improve accuracy.","","979-8-3503-0082-6","10.1109/NMITCON58196.2023.10275921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10275921","springboot framework;LTSA framework;MOOC system;GLR algorithm","Computer aided instruction;Electronic learning;Multimedia systems;Education;Systems architecture;Light rail systems;Behavioral sciences","","","","20","IEEE","17 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As opposed to other popular learning networks, such as multilayer perceptron, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, and locally linear neuro-fuzzy model, ADBEL network offers lower computational complexity and fast learning, which make it an ideal candidate for the time series prediction in an online fashion. In fact, these prominent features are inherited from the mechanism employed by the limbic system of the mammalian brain in processing the external stimuli, which also forms the basis of the ADBEL network. This paper aims at further enhancing the forecasting performance of the ADBEL network through its integration with a neo-fuzzy network. The selection of the neo-fuzzy network is made as it offers features required for online prediction in real time environments including simplicity, transparency, accuracy, and lower computational complexity. Furthermore, this integration is only considered in the orbitofrontal cortex section of the ADBEL network and only three membership functions are employed to realize the neo-fuzzy neuron. Thus, the resultant neo-fuzzy integrated ADBEL (NF-ADBEL) network is still simple and can be deployed in online prediction problems. Few chaotic time series namely the Mackey glass, Lorenz, Rossler, and the Disturbance storm time index as well as the Narendra dynamic plant identification problem are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed NF-ADBEL network in terms of the root mean squared error and correlation coefficient criterions using MATLAB®programming environment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2637381","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7778154","Brain emotional decayed learning;neo-fuzzy network;chaotic time series;dynamic plant identification;MATLAB","Time series analysis;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Brain modeling;Forecasting;Predictive models;Computational complexity","","25","","48","OAPA","8 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When the application detects a spoofed message, it triggers an alert message and sends the spoofed message into a spoof filter. Moreover, the user who has received the spoofed message is given the option of notifying the real sender of the spoofing attack. In this way an active spoof control is achieved. The application is hosted using the HTTPS protocol and uses notification messages that are sent in parallel with email messages via a channel that has been secured by the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. The notification messages allows the application to detect spoofed emails.

Whenever athletes suffer head trauma, concussion field tests that measure their perceptiveness and cognitive abilities are commonly administered. However, these tests have limited accuracy due to the lack of quantitative data basing the diagnosis, and often those administering concussion tests feel pressured to keep athletes playing in the game despite cognitive impairment. To solve this, an inexpensive diagnostic helmet targeting youth sports teams was created, providing quantitative data regarding how much head trauma an athlete has experienced. The helmet is connected to a web-based application system that stores real time data regarding the impact of the head injury, the region of the brain impacted, the time of injury, and speed at which the injury occurred, allowing for the design of more patient-tailored treatment plans. The device and web application were programmed using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the Node.js platform in the Intel Edison IoT IDE. Once the force sensitive resistors register an impact significant enough to cause a concussion based upon an algorithm that takes into consideration the player's height and weight, a text message is automatically sent to local paramedics through the Twilio API. This device therefore removes existing bias involved in diagnostics, allows doctors to more accurately handle injuries, and helps ensure player safety.","","978-1-5386-1104-3","10.1109/UEMCON.2017.8249087","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8249087","Consumer electronics;Applied engineering;Mechatronics;Healthcare electronics;Medical electronics;Intel Edison;Wireless computing;Patient care;Internet of Things;Application;SMS;Traumatic Brain Injury","Force;Brain injuries;Head;Sensors;Acceleration;Resistors","","3","","15","IEEE","8 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address these issues, we have created the BlockPy programming environment, a web-based, open-access, open-source platform for introductory computing students (https://www.blockpy.com). BlockPy has an embedded data science context that allows learners to connect the educational content with real-world scenarios through meaningful problems. The environment is block-based and gives guiding feedback to learners as they complete problems, but also mediates transfer to more sophisticated programming environments by supporting bidirectional, seamless transitions between block and text programming. Although it can be used as a stand-alone application, the environment has first-class support for the latest Learning Tools Interoperability standards, so that instructors can embed the environment directly within their Learning Management System.

To save energy in cloud data centers, dynamic virtual machine consolidation can be thought of one of the best methods. In this approach, some of the under-loaded physical machines (PMs)are put either into low-power mode or are switched-off with the help of live migration of Virtual Machines(VMs). But the number of migrations may also produce more Carbon dioxide emissions and indirectly much energy is consumed. To avoid this situation, clustering of PMs can be done and these clusters can be assigned to the respective consolidation managers. Consolidation of VM is strictly NP-hard problem, so, we are using the hybrid of metaheuristic optimization algorithms. The hybrid of algorithms is expected to produce better results in terms of number of migrations and energy consumption. This hybrid canbe implemented using various tools like CloudSim embedded with either Eclipse IDE or Netbeans.","","978-1-5090-1066-0","10.1109/CESYS.2016.7889945","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7889945","Energy Efficiency;Green Cloud Computing /Soft Computing;Dynamic VM Consolidation;Hybrid","Cloud computing;Heuristic algorithms;Power demand;Virtual machining;Algorithm design and analysis;Energy efficiency;Optimization","","2","","15","IEEE","30 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Though commonly employed in industry, manual exploratory testing of web application GUIs was proven to be mundane and expensive. Gamification applied to that kind of testing activity has the potential to overcome its limitations, though no empirical research has explored this area yet. Goal: Collect preliminary insights on how gamification, when performed by novice testers, affects the effectiveness, efficiency, test case realism, and user experience in exploratory testing of web applications. Method: Common gamification features augment an existing exploratory testing tool: Final Score with Leaderboard, Injected Bugs, Progress Bar, and Exploration Highlights. The original tool and the gamified version are then compared in an experiment involving 144 participants. User experience is elicited using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire instrument. Results: Statistical analysis identified several significant differences for metrics that represent the effectiveness and efficiency of tests showing an improvement in coverage when they were developed with gamification. Additionally, user experience is improved with gamification. Conclusions: Gamification of exploratory testing has a tangible effect on how testers create test cases for web applications. While the results are mixed, the effects are most beneficial and interesting and warrant more research in the future. Further research shall be aimed at confirming the presented results in the context of state-of-the-art testing tools and real-world development environments.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2023.3348036","Ministero dell’Università e della Ricerca(grant numbers:2022PCCMLF); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10375892","Software testing;web application testing;gamification","Software testing;Graphical user interfaces;Manuals;Software;Task analysis;Games;User experience","","","","48","IEEE","28 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Firstly, the design of IIoT is fragmented and distributed. Secondly, existing PLC tools are hard to meet and dramatically complicated in emergent industries. Most of all, the deployment of IIoT is state-of-the-art engineering in complexity. A scheme to integrate the GRAFCET virtual machine (GVM) with a digital twin proposed enables IIoT systems in rapidly changing environments. They are compiling digital logic programs that support GVM at remote locations, deploying distributed manufacturing systems through IIoT communication networks, and building operational models of digital virtual and physical systems through digital twin modeling. Its behavior in dynamic operating environments is predictable. The results show that GRAFCET is not only IEC 60848 standard but also IEC 61131–3 for the PLCopen programming tool. Furthermore, a gateway of GVM performs rapid deployment of edge-cloud PLC programming.

Many applications dealing with massive data and complex queries are routed to the cloud. The response time depends on query optimization and resource scheduling. There are several techniques to optimize the query and resource scheduling but the information about the query is not stored i.e. the frequent queries will recursively do the same set of procedures. Hence, to reduce the time consumed by redundant query processing procedure we introduce agents in Hadoop framework (JobTracker). As JobTracker is a single point of failure i.e. if this goes down, all running jobs are halted. Therefore, we introduce agents in place of JobTracker to intellectually process the query and assign the task to TaskTrackers.

As an effort to overcome this problem, an electronic election recapitulation system application is raised to become one of the solutions to be used at the 2024 election. An important part of this application is a scalable backend system. This paper aims to provide a design and also build a backend system that is able to serve every request well. Aspects that are considered in this application are database schemes and flow and implementation at the application level, and application deployment environment to support application performance in dealing with large numbers of requests, but mainly focuses on the aspects of load testing and cost analysis of the deployment environments. The solution that was successfully developed is an application using the Golang programming language connected to the PostgreSQL database and deployed both server-based and serverless Kubernetes on Alibaba Cloud and Google Cloud. After the system has been built, load testing is carried out to test the system's ability to deal with many requests at the same time.

Our results reveal that developers most commonly post questions to change behavior of existing code. Further, specific discussions or changes in code fragments that conceptually have the same intention (e.g. both document.querySelector(“x”) and $(“x”) retrieve references from the DOM), often presented reoccurring challenges that demanded different reasoning to obtain equivalent runtime information (e.g. check if a DOM reference matches what is intended in the output). Code idioms are those concepts underlying patterns in code and by categorizing them, we were able to associate their challenges to execution information barriers that prevent developers from observing relevant state and behavior at runtime (e.g. mapping a DOM reference in a code fragment to its element in the output), and selection barriers that prevent developers from finding or choosing the correct object, method, or parameter values to achieve a desired behavior (e.g. generating code that references a DOM element).","1943-6106","978-1-5386-0443-4","10.1109/VLHCC.2017.8103488","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8103488","","Navigation;Runtime;Tools;Visualization;Programming;Cascading style sheets;Cognition","","","","3","IEEE","13 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of Ajax requests in JavaScript results in two main issues, traditional type checking in other programming languages is not available in JavaScript and JavaScript application does not know what APIs the remote server serves. In this paper, we will introduce a novel tool called Ajax Validator to solve some of the consequences of the mentioned issues. We will use Swagger to validate Ajax requests against their specifications in terms of Local Ajax HTTP Method and Body consistency, Local Ajax HTTP Method and Remote HTTP Method consistency, and Local and Remote HTTP Headers consistency. To evaluate our tool, we obtained 666 swagger specifications for different API providers using the GURU project and nine JavaScript applications from GitHub. From the nine JavaScript Applications, our results showed that eight applications were locally consistent, and one was not. Five applications were remotely consistent, one was not and three of them were not applicable to the validator checking, due to syntax errors or non-matching paths in the Swagger specification. Regarding the header validation, one application was missing two headers in one of its Ajax requests that were specified in the Swagger specification. Also, the same Ajax request specified three headers that were not expected by the Swagger specification. Allowing IDEs to have such Ajax requests checking capabilities in static time will help in reducing the testing costs as long as reducing the runtime errors that a developer could face and fix.","","978-1-7281-0554-3","10.1109/CCWC.2019.8666542","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8666542","Swagger;jQuery;Ajax;Validation","Servers;Runtime;Tools;Payloads;Data mining;Testing;Computer science","","4","","11","IEEE","14 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Studying developers' behavior is crucial for designing effective techniques and tools to support developers' daily work. However, there are two challenges in collecting and analyzing developers' behavior data. First, instrumenting many software tools commonly used in real work settings (e.g., IDEs, web browsers) is difficult and requires significant resources. Second, the collected behavior data consist of low-level and fine-grained event sequences, which must be abstracted into high-level development activities for further analysis. To address these two challenges, we first use our ActivitySpace framework to improve the generalizability of the data collection. Then, we propose a Condition Random Field (CRF) based approach to segment and label the developers' low-level actions into a set of basic, yet meaningful development activities. To evaluate our proposed approach, we deploy the ActivitySpace framework in an industry partner's company and collect the real working data from ten professional developers' one-week work. We conduct an experiment with the collected data and a small number of initial human-labeled training data using the CRF model and the other three baselines (i.e., a heuristic-rules based method, a SVM classifier, and a random weighted classifier). The proposed CRF model achieves better performance (i.e., 0.728 accuracy and 0.672 macro-averaged F1-score) than the other three baselines.","1558-1225","978-1-4503-5638-1","10.1145/3180155.3182537","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8453167","Software development;Developers' interaction data;Condition Random Field","Software engineering;Australia;Tools;Software;Computer science;Information technology;Information systems","","2","","","","2 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This software testing of a QNN via dynamic analysis is essentially required due to undetermined probabilistic qubit states during runtime operations. Furthermore, an EQuaTE is capable of visual feedback because the barren plateaus can be identified at local autonomous driving platforms, and the corresponding information will be visualized at remotely connected cloud. Based on this visualized information at the cloud, the QNN, which is also stored at cloud, should be automatically reorganized and retrained for eliminating barren plateaus.

When these platforms do not support specific cognitive styles, they create barriers to programming for some populations. Research shows that the cognitive styles typically favored by women are often unsupported, creating barriers to entry for woman newcomers. In this paper, we use the GenderMag method to evaluate GitHub to find cognitive style-specific inclusivity bugs. We redesigned the ""buggy"" GitHub features through a web browser plugin, which we evaluated through a between-subjects experiment (n=75). Our results indicate that the changes to the interface improve users' performance and self-efficacy, mainly for individuals with cognitive styles more common to women. Our results can inspire designers of social coding platforms and software engineering tools to produce more inclusive development environments.General Abstract—Diversity is an important aspect of society. One form of diversity is cognitive diversity—differences in cognitive styles, which helps generate a diversity of thoughts. Unfortunately, software tools often do not support different cognitive styles (e.g., learning styles), disproportionately impacting those whose styles are not supported. These individuals pay a cognitive ""tax"" each time they use the tools. In this work, we found ""inclusivity bugs"" in GitHub, a social coding platform. We then redesigned these buggy features and evaluated them with users. Our results show that the redesign makes it easier for the group of individuals whose cognitive styles were unsupported in the original design, with the percentage of completed tasks rising from 67% to 95% for this group.","2832-7616","979-8-3503-2261-3","10.1109/ICSE-SEIS58686.2023.00007","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10173918","open source;diversity and inclusion;human factors;cognitive styles;human-computer interaction","Computer bugs;Sociology;Programming;Encoding;Cultural differences;Task analysis;Statistics","","2","","71","IEEE","11 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Besides that, cloud-native architectures also present new security challenges. Cloud-native separates monolithic virtual machines into microservice pods, resulting in higher volumes of signaling and communication flowing through and between microservices. In addition, secure connections in monolithic applications have been replaced by untrusted communication between microservice pods, requiring additional cybersecurity capabilities. Access control systems were created to provide reliability and limit access to an organization’s assets. However, due to technology's constant evolution and dynamicity, these conventional security systems lack the security to protect an organization’s information because they were created to address access control for known users. For 5G based cloud native technology, these access controls need to be taken further by implementing a Zero Trust model to secure one’s essential assets for all users within the system. Zero Trust is implemented in an access control system under the concept ""Never Trust, Always Verify"". In this paper, we implement zero trust as a factor within access control systems by combining the principles of access control systems and zero-trust security by factoring in the user’s historical behavior and recommendations into the mix.","2161-5330","979-8-3503-1943-9","10.1109/AICCSA59173.2023.10479308","Air Force Research Laboratory; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10479308","Access Control;Zero Trust Security;5G;Cloud-native;RBAC","Access control;Cloud computing;5G mobile communication;Microservice architectures;Computer architecture;Virtual machining;Software","","1","","43","IEEE","2 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, the speed at which the industry is working is faster than ever before. The Colour forecasting process in many fashion organizations is not visible to the public. A forecasting method is proposed in this study to provide colour trends to industries in advance. Predicting colour trends would allow retailers to improve their logistics for the storage/shipping of clothes. This research proposes a systematic prediction model to forecast colour quickly and cost-effectively in real-time data. This research examines the colour forecasting process, its methodology, and how it is presented and used in the fashion industry. This study used Machine Learning (ML) to examine image data from the latest fashion trends to collect data via web-scraping images, extracting colours from images using k-means algorithms, and assessing the most trending 45 colours. We feed trendy clothing colours from different Pakistani brand websites to the algorithm. The algorithm predicts the frequency of each colour to either be positive or negative in the future. This research uses a forecasting model like ARIMA to forecast colour trends. Furthermore, the mean squared error is quite low, at 0.025. As a result, the current intelligent prediction system meets the criteria for capturing colour in trends for organizations. It would be a good development tool to maximize the profits of fashion companies and minimize the loss. Furthermore, it enables industries to make decisions for selecting colour trends.","","979-8-3503-4593-3","10.1109/FIT57066.2022.00061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10043096","Colour forecasting;Colour prediction and analysis;Fashion industry;Machine Learning","Industries;Machine learning algorithms;Image color analysis;Machine learning;Companies;Predictive models;Market research","","1","","15","IEEE","17 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Security and verification solutions have been proposed and/or implemented either externally or with limited computational power. Online verification or intrusion detection solutions are typically difficult to implement within the control logic of the programmable logic controller due to the strict timing requirements and limited resources. Recently, there has been an increased advancement in open controller systems where programmable logic controllers are coupled with embedded hypervisors running operating systems with much more computational power. Development environments are provided that allow developers to directly integrate library function calls from the embedded hypervisor into the program scan cycle of the programmable logic controller.

In online shopping scenarios, the user would use the modification text as feedback to describe the difference between the reference and the desired image. In order to handle the task, there must be two main problems needed to be addressed. One is the localization problem: how to precisely find those spatial areas of the image mentioned by the text. The other is the modification problem: how to effectively modify the image semantics based on the text. However, existing methods merely fuse information coarsely from the two-modality, while the accurate spatial and semantic correspondence between these two heterogeneous features tends to be neglected. Therefore, image details cannot be precisely located and modified. To this end, we consider integrating information from the two modalities more accurately from spatial and semantic aspects. Thus, we propose an end-to-end framework for the CIR task, which contains three key components, i.e., Multi-level Collaborative Localization module (MCL), Differential Semantics Discrimination module (DSD), and Image Difference Enhancement constraints (IDE). Specifically, to solve the localization problem, MCL precisely locates the text to the image areas by collaboratively using text positioning information on multiple image layers. For the modification problem, DSD builds a distribution to evaluate the modification possibility of each image semantic dimension, and IDE effectively learns the modification patterns of text against image embedding based on the distribution. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance against the SOTA methods.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2023.3273466","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2021ZD0112100); National NSF of China(grant numbers:61972022,U1936212,62120106009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10120671","Composed image retrieval;multi-modal fusion and embedding;multi-modal representation learning;multi-modal retrieval;image retrieval","Semantics;Location awareness;Task analysis;Image retrieval;Training;Collaboration;Transformers","","","","60","IEEE","5 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Both worlds have their own quirks but each one serves their purpose well. Vagrant, the older brother, uses virtual machines to create isolated environments for software development. On the other side, Docker uses another technique called Containers for isolation and in that term uses local system files and resources. Before those tools, there were so many problems with porting applications, setting them up on other development machines or servers. The problem was that all machines had different setups, some had different versions of required files or they didn't have required extensions. Modern distributed applications development often faces two problems, first problem is inconsistency of development environments because of multiple versions of operating systems and packages and the second one is services and discrepancies between development and test/deployment environments. Virtualization technology, such as virtual machines (VMs) and containers that can handle these problems effectively, but they are often difficult to use in real-world development processes due to the lack of appropriate tools for developers. Modern distributed applications, especially web applications, are typically built using a set of loosely coupled services, with rapid development and deployment cycles. These services may run in multiple virtual machines and are ephemeral according to clients demands. This paper presents both tools, compares them and shows which one of them is the best for which specific use. The purpose of this paper is to show when and why to use which tool and to show advantages and disadvantages of each one.","","978-1-7281-3258-7","10.1109/ICAMCS46079.2018.00016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8955312","Isolated enviroment;Docker;Vagrant;virtualization;comparison;software;development","","","1","","16","IEEE","14 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A number of trends under the broad banner of crowdsourcing are beginning to fundamentally disrupt the way in which software is engineered. Programmers increasingly rely on crowdsourced knowledge and code, as they look to Q&A sites for answers or use code from publicly posted snippets. Programmers play, compete, and learn with the crowd, engaging in programming competitions and puzzles with crowds of programmers. Online IDEs make possible radically new forms of collaboration, allowing developers to synchronously program with crowds of distributed programmers. Programmers' reputation is increasingly visible on Q&A sites and public code repositories, opening new possibilities in how developers find jobs and companies identify talent. Crowds of non-programmers increasingly participate in development, usability testing software or even constructing specifications while playing games. Crowdfunding democratizes choices about which software is built, broadening the software which might be feasibly constructed. Approaches for crowd development seek to microtask software development, dramatically increasing participation in open source by enabling software projects to be built through casual, transient work. The 4th International Workshop on CrowdSourcing in Software Engineering (CSI-SE) seeks to understand how crowdsourcing is shaping and disrupting software development, shedding light on the opportunities and challenges. We encourage submissions of studies, systems, and techniques relevant to the application of crowdsourcing (broadly construed) to software engineering.","","978-1-5386-4041-8","10.1109/CSI-SE.2017.11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7972754","","Software;Software engineering;Crowdsourcing;Codes;Conferences;Programming profession;Knowledge engineering","","","","","IEEE","11 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Mostly, such information is estimated from spectral indices using either, software with heavy pre-requirements on the machines, or by introducing programmable codes using different programming languages, or other development tools. This paper intends to introduce and demonstrate the details of a simple tool “Ppmask” to generate pre-processing masks for generalized remote sensing analysis of land cover in mountainous regions. The tool yields cloud and cloud shadow masks irrespective of the existence of thermal bands in the source imagery. Further, the tool is capable of extracting several spectral indices and corresponding land cover masks based on these indices. The applicability of the tool is demonstrated using data sets of Landsat-8 and Sentine1-2 imagery. To assess the quality of masks, a comparison is made with the results from the ”Fmask” algorithm for cloud and shadow masks. Another assessment is made by comparison of land cover masks generated by the utility “Ppmask” for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery.","","978-1-5386-4254-2","10.1109/CCTES.2018.8674098","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8674098","Remote sensing;land surface;multispectral imaging;cloud;cloud shadow;NDVI;NDSI","Snow;Cloud computing;Tools;Indexes;Vegetation mapping;Clouds;Remote sensing","","1","","17","IEEE","28 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Active Distance Learning of Embedded Systems","A. Shoufan","Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",IEEE Access,"16 Mar 2021","2021","9","","41104","41122","The move from face-to-face to distance learning poses a challenge for courses that rely on hands-on experience such as embedded systems. In this course, students need to work with hardware and software to achieve various learning objectives. For full advantage, the hands-on experience should be aligned with the acquisition of related concepts and procedural knowledge. The alignment of conceptual learning with hands-on experience is a big challenge, in general, and for distance learning, in particular. This article describes how different learning technologies can be integrated to achieve such alignment for embedded systems in a distance learning mode. A framework for active, lecture-free learning was established using a learning management system, YouTube, various web resources, a hardware kit, and a software development environment. The learning activities were implemented as ungraded quizzes on Moodle with different types of questions. These include review questions, conceptual questions, procedural questions, brainstorming questions, code analysis questions, and code creation questions. Our students used the provided hardware kit and the software development environment to complete the learning activities throughout the semester without listening to any live or recorded lecture from our end. This instructional design was evaluated by analyzing learning data generated by Moodle as well as self-report data. The results show high student engagement and positive perceptions of the course content and the learning method. We believe that the proposed pedagogical framework of this design is of general value and can be adopted in other engineering courses with similar requirements of hands-on experience in distance learning.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3065248","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9374477","Distance learning;embedded systems;learning management systems;student engagement;lecture-free instruction;COVID-19","Computer aided instruction;Embedded systems;Hardware;Software;Education;Pandemics","","21","","51","CCBY","10 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Questions nevertheless frequently arise: Is this program satisfying the given task? Why is my program not working? To support learners and educators, automated program analysis is needed for answering such questions. While adapting existing analyses to process blocks instead of textual statements is straightforward, the domain of programs controlled by block-based languages like Scratch is very different from traditional programs: In Scratch multiple actors, represented as highly concurrent programs, interact on a graphical stage, controlled by user inputs, and while the block-based program statements look playful, they hide complex mathematical operations that determine visual aspects and movement. Analyzing such programs is further hampered by the absence of clearly defined semantics, often resulting from ad-hoc decisions made by the implementers of the programming environment. To enable program analysis, we define the semantics of Scratch using an intermediate language. Based on this intermediate language, we implement the Bastet program analysis framework for Scratch programs, using concepts from abstract interpretation and software model checking. Like Scratch, Bastet is based on Web technologies, written in TypeScript, and can be executed using NodeJS or even directly in a browser. Evaluation on 279 programs written by children suggests that Bastet offers a practical solution for analysis of Scratch programs, thus enabling applications such as automated hint generation, automated evaluation of learner progress, or automated grading.","2643-1572","978-1-4503-6768-4","","DFG(grant numbers:FR 2955/3-1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9286012","Software Model Checking;Scratch;Education","Computer languages;Visualization;Semantics;Model checking;Software;Task analysis;Programming environments","","","","77","","24 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For large FaaS applications, strong process and operational controls combined with automation are necessary to provide reasonable assurance of application security during the development and deployment process.

It looks at designing networks, creating “safe‐space” sandbox environments, and building virtual walls to more closely control who gets access to specific resources. Firewalls and other network configuration tools can be used to segment his/her resources, reducing risk exposure for vulnerable devices. Multitiered network designs can provide significant protection. Such designs include demilitarized zones, bastion hosts, and networks divided by purpose (development/staging/production). For local infrastructure, isolated development environments are built using traditional physical or virtual networking. Cloud providers offer simpler—and often much cheaper—alternatives for isolation using, as in the case of AWS, distinct virtual private clouds or even organizational accounts for each environment he/she needs. The chapter also describes how OS operation can gain additional security through the use of mandatory access controls.","","9781119781578","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9942229.pdf&bkn=9942222&pdfType=chapter","","Firewalls (computing);Web servers;Buildings;Software;Cloud computing;Marine vehicles;Databases","","","","","","8 Nov 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

In the computer network, clustering is the key feature of big data hiding in heterogeneous network. In a word, the data chain in the network is more compact, and the data link between structures is more evacuation. As an important network data application method and traditional data development tool, clustering algorithm has been widely used in academia and society. Based on this, a parallel clustering algorithm for feature hiding big data in heterogeneous networks is proposed. On the premise of establishing the fuzzy equivalent constraint Association of hidden data, the heterogeneous measurement of mixed data is calculated, and online clustering is realized by reconstructing data structure. The experimental results show that the parallel clustering algorithm designed in this paper can achieve good clustering results in data sets, and can measure the differences between data and classes more accurately and reasonably. The new algorithm overcomes the shortcomings of traditional clustering algorithm which classifies attributes according to the overall size of data set or the dispersion degree within the cluster. Compared with other data clustering algorithms, the algorithm proposed in this paper has higher practicability and higher clustering quality.","","978-1-7281-8666-5","10.1109/ICICTA51737.2020.00096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9526682","Heterogeneous network;hiding large data;parallel clustering;Constraint Association","Automation;Clustering algorithms;Big Data;Tools;Data structures;Big Data applications;Heterogeneous networks","","","","15","IEEE","13 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The NF-ADBEL network is suitable for online time series prediction with shorter update intervals and offers features such as fast learning, accuracy, simplicity, and lower computational complexity. However, the neo-fuzzy neuron network in NF-ADBEL was integrated only in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) part of the ADBEL network. This paper aims to further improve the performance of the NF-ADBEL network by integrating the neo-fuzzy neuron network into the amygdala (AMY) section as well, inspired by a fully integrated version of a neo-fuzzy-based pattern recognizer. As is known, the AMY has two outputs: one response is based on imprecise information received from the thalamus, and the second response is based on information received from the sensory cortex. In this study, the imprecise response generation is operated as previously, while the other AMY process is treated by neo-fuzzy neurons. The resultant network is called Expanded Neo-Fuzzy integrated Adaptive Decayed Brain Emotional Learning (ENF-ADBEL). The modified network is still simple and meets the requirement for online prediction problems. A few chaotic and stochastic nonlinear systems, namely the Mackey-Glass, Lorenz, Rossler, disturbance storm time index, Narendra dynamic plant identification, wind speed and wind power series, are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed network in terms of the root mean squared error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient (COR) criteria in a MATLAB programming environment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3076668","National Science and Engineering Research Council Canada (NSERC); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9419028","Amygdala;brain emotional decayed learning;chaotic time series;disturbance storm time index;dynamic plant identification;forecasting;MATLAB;neo-fuzzy networks;wind speed;wind power series","Neurons;Time series analysis;Adaptive systems;Indexes;Brain modeling;Wind power generation;Training","","2","","30","CCBY","29 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The growing importance of “flipping the classroom” and the needful emphasizing of online-learning were owed to the situation. To meet these requirements, materials and tasks must be adapted. The Open Educational Resource (OER) textbook “Computational Thinking with the BBC micro:bit” was developed for the introduction of Computational Thinking (CT) for 10-14-year-old pupils in Austria's secondary schools. Example tasks in the textbook are designed with an open end and present extensions with ideas for further development instead of ending abruptly. This article provides a guideline for a clear distinction in redesigning existing lessons following the Inverted Classroom Model (ICM) using videos for pre-class work and live task extensions for in-class work. Which parts in the learning design must remain as live lessons and which parts can be adapted for video lessons? The respective research shows that examples that have a makerspace activity as an extension are especially helpful for an efficient determination of the appropriate part in the learning design and particularly suitable for an adaptation with ICM. The central advantage of the ICM is that it responds flexibly to the individual learning needs of each student. It allows students to take their time reviewing the material at their own pace without getting left behind. The textbook used here encourages pupils to find their own solutions by explorative learning using the block-based programming environment MakeCode. Additional information to be uncovered by the learner is provided for every single step in the accompanying online wiki website. Results from observations showed that this uncover-function, being a central element of the online material, encouraged the learners to explore their own way in finding a solution with playful elements and increased motivation. The many haptic elements of a makerspace activity are in particular useful for consolidation of the learned and are predisposed for in-class work and deepening the understanding following the constructionism theory. A Design-Based Research (DBR) approach is used to create and evaluate the redesign of a proven example task in a pilot project. Teachers, who are already familiar with the BBC micro:bit and the OER textbook, were trained on how to use the “flip-version” of an example task in their lessons and asked to develop a lesson plan for implementation. The didactic approach to redesigning the material and teacher training was evaluated during the first cycle of DBR. Results from expert interviews showed that the redesigned material and training deliver a solid ground for rework and further research on a larger scale.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637170","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637170","microbit;inverted classroom;flipped classroom;makerspace;block-based programming;computational thinking;computer science","Training;Adaptation models;Streaming media;Time measurement;Online services;Distributed Bragg reflectors;Task analysis","","1","","39","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we conducted a three-week (six hour) virtual after-school program which introduced high school students with different programming backgrounds to coding in MYR. During the program, students learned the basics of MYR, introductory CS topics, and completed individual coding projects, creating an original MYR scene.A study examined changes in students’ spatial reasoning as a result of this intervention. The students’ performance in spatial skills was measured using the Revised Purdue Spatial Visualization Test: Visualization of Rotations (Revised PSVT:R) [1]. Students completed this instrument using a pre/post survey design. We analyzed the impact of the intervention using a paired samples T-test. We further developed a rubric for analyzing the sophistication of students’ MYR code and applied it to evaluating the programming expertise of our study participants.The program was hosted twice with two different groups of high school students. Most showed interest in MYR programming and expressed their creativity and learned skills in their original project. With the first group of students, we found increases in their spatial visualization performance after the intervention with MYR, though statistical significance was not reached. The second group of students had higher baseline prior experience in computing and spatial visualization skills; these students did not further increase in their spatial visualization skill.The analysis showed that the MYR has a potential to improve spatial skills and engage students’ interest in computing. We recommend that MYR and related computational environments be further studied and made available to students.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-6244-0","10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962403","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962403","Computer science education;Spatial skills;Virtual reality","Visualization;Correlation;Instruments;Virtual reality;Encoding;Cognition;Programming profession","","1","","15","IEEE","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Managing and making sellers' reputations available to buyers is vital for the success of these markets since buyers may be dealing with unknown online sellers. Typically, prospective buyers assess sellers' performance by looking at past buyers' reviews, prior to making a purchase. In current online marketplaces, buyers' reviews are associated with their identities, raising privacy issues. Several decentralized solutions have been proposed using blockchain technologies to solve this problem. However, some of these systems are not entirely decentralized or have some weaknesses such as requiring a trusted third party. In this paper, we propose a system for decentralized reviewing that trades off cost for unlinkability. Using blockchain-based smart contracts, we propose a fully decentralized marketplace to provide reviewers with a secure and trusted platform. Here, buyers can use one-time identities to provide feedback on their transactions. The system also ensures that a review can only be submitted after a transaction is completed, and that at most one review may be submitted per transaction. The system enforces these properties through blockchain technologies and smart contracts. In addition, we propose an innovative approach to encourage buyers to submit reviews. The system has been prototyped using Remix IDE.","2832-8906","979-8-3503-1019-1","10.1109/ICBC56567.2023.10175001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10175001","smart contract;reputation system;blockchain;anonymity;linkability;privacy","Privacy;Costs;Smart contracts;Blockchains;Cryptocurrency;Business","","1","","24","IEEE","12 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such deployment of FPGA creates a new attack surface for adversary. It has been recently demonstrated that the capacitive crosstalk between FPGA long-wires can be used as a side-channel to extract secret information. In this paper, we present HILL: a Hardware Isolation framework against information Leakage on multi-tenant FPGA Long-wires. As a defense framework, HILL can prioritize the placement and routing of security-critical hardware instances and isolate them from other parts and tenants. For data and communication interfaces that use FPGA long-wires, such as UART, PCIe, and AXI4, HILL employs a long-wire obfuscation technique to reduce the side-channel leakage. We evaluate the performance of HILL with Xilinx Artix-7 FPGAs using two prevalent FPGA development tools: Xilinx ISE 14.7 and Vivado 2018.3. The experimental results demonstrate that HILL can effectively reduce the crosstalk-caused side-channel leakage by 138 times. The long-wire obfuscation technique reduces the correlation between the side-channel leakage and secret key from 81.7% to 50.3%, which is close to random guess.","","978-1-7281-2943-3","10.1109/ICFPT47387.2019.00060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8977864","FPGA;Long wires;multi tenant;side channel;capacitive crosstalk","","","21","","6","IEEE","3 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A mechanism has been designed whereby the mobile device can identify the strength of the Internet connection available. The system operates on two metrics; round trip time and bandwidth and using these two metrics, contents to be displayed on the mobile device are eventually adapted.

To address these issues, this paper introduces BlockPy, a block-based environment for Python (http://www.blockpy.com). BlockPy is a web-based, open-access programming environment that supports introductory programming with an emphasis on data science. It promotes long-term transfer by scaffolding an introduction to textual programming (Python) through a block-based programming view, ideal for beginners of any background. By supporting the latest Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standards, BlockPy is designed to support both informal learners and formal class settings. Specifically, it can be configured to provide guiding feedback for its interactive programming problems, so as to support learners at their own pace. The results from a pilot study of the initial deployment and utilization of BlockPy indicate the potential of the environment to address many of the problems faced by novice learners.","0730-3157","978-1-4673-8845-0","10.1109/COMPSAC.2016.132","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7552097","Computer science education;Computer aided instruction;Data analysis;Web services","Programming profession;Programming environments;Software;Conferences","","","","","IEEE","25 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using traditional storage methods, farmers can inhibit the spoilage of onions. But, in some situations, people may fail to notice the spoiled onions and in such a scenario they can depend on technology involving some deep learning algorithms and sensors. In the existing techniques, the system which consists of IoT framework alone faced many challenges because sometimes it may predict the data wrongly due to environmental conditions and leading it to an inefficient technique to detect onion spoilage. To overcome this kind of challenge, it is a must that technology like image processing should be included. This paper discusses the model that was developed using Google Colab IDE, which is based on image processing. Combining the segmentation and object extraction process has improved the image features, as it discards the background and other unnecessary things around the main object in our application. CNN model has got 87% accuracy, this shows a good result after evaluation. After this image processing segment, the work continues with the IoT framework that senses the parameters of onions using esp8266 & sensors, and it displays the stages of spoilage on LCD. Through this system, farmers and retail sellers can get early information about the spoilage of onions by accessing the real-time values through the web page.","2767-7788","979-8-3503-9849-6","10.1109/ICICT57646.2023.10134248","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10134248","Onion;Image processing;Segmentation;Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN);Internet of Things","Image segmentation;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Web pages;Feature extraction;Prediction algorithms;Sensor systems","","4","","15","IEEE","1 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Examples that illustrate the usage of an engine to build concrete visualizations offer a good starting point, but developers may have to traverse long lists of categories and analyze examples one-by-one to find a suitable one. We propose MetaVis, a tool that fills the gap between existing visualization techniques and their practical applications during software development. We classify questions frequently formulated by software developers and for each, based on our expertise, identify suitable visualizations. MetaVis uses tags mined from these questions to offer a tag-iconic cloud-based visualization. Each tag links to suitable visualizations that developers can explore, modify and try out.

The healthcare system provides a report card of our health at regular intervals of time. The proposed smart health care monitoring system monitors the patient’s health condition and updates the same to the neighbours and doctors by using IoT technology. It addresses blood pressure, oxygen concentration in our blood, heart rate, and atmospheric pressure. The proposed system contains several sensors which are responsible for complete patient health monitoring. The system generates and stores useful continuous health data. After storing the health data in the cloud, the data has to be pre-processed and then generated into one report which includes the status of the health condition of the corresponding patient. The system reduces the cost of the treatment because patient needn’t to come daily to take readings of body temperature, SpO 2 etc. The system is basically wireless so we can embed at any location and the doctors and healthcare monitors can collects a data from any remote location. The major advantage of the system is more than one doctors collect the data from the cloudIoT at the same time. The system contains wireless sensors and application for displaying report of the person at each interval of time. It is very useful for the person who is living away from hospital or any remote location. It reduces time for the doctor so that they can attend more patients. In this paper, we used appropriate sensors which collect the appropriate data, so it is very useful for the doctor who analyses the data and predict the diseases. The proposed system used MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry transport) as a connectivity protocol as well as I2C (Inter Integrated Circuit). Here we used C, C++, and Arduino IDE as well open source IOT platform i.e., Ubidots. In this paper, we used experimental modal analysis system where the natural frequencies like heart rate, body temperature, ECG etc. are adopted as the observations.","","978-1-6654-5046-1","10.1109/INCOFT55651.2022.10094409","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10094409","Internet of Things;Application Programming Interface;Electrocardiogram;MQTT and I2C","Temperature sensors;Wireless communication;Temperature measurement;Wireless sensor networks;Medical services;Sensors;Software reliability","","12","","11","IEEE","13 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Besides, it might not even be possible to try-on clothes in such cases as online shopping. Our motivation here is to increase the time efficiency and improve the accessibility of clothes try on by creating a virtual dressing room environment. In this work, we introduce a virtual dressing room application using Microsoft Kinect sensor. Our proposed approach is mainly based on extraction of the user from the video stream, alignment of models and skin color detection. We use the modules for locations of the joints for positioning, scaling and rotation in order to align the 2D cloth models with the user. Then, we apply skin color detection on video to handle the unwanted occlusions of the user and the model. Finally, the model is superimposed on the user in real time. The problem is simply the alignment of the user and the cloth models with accurate position, scale, rotation and ordering. First, detection of the user and the body parts is one of the main steps of the problem. In literature, several approaches are proposed for body part detection, skeletal tracking and posture estimation, and superimposing it onto a virtual environment in the user interface. The project is implemented in C# programming environment for real time, Kinect hacking application. Kinect driver's middleware are used for various fundamental functions and for the tracking process in combination with Microsoft Kinect.","","978-1-5386-7942-5","10.1109/JEEIT.2019.8717410","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8717410","Virtual dressing room;Microsoft Kinect;WPF","Streaming media;Clothing;Two dimensional displays;Skeleton;Microsoft Windows;Hip;Cameras","","11","","10","IEEE","20 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

What types of learners can be distinguished on the basis of the behaviour patterns of task solving? The analysis of learners’ behaviour patterns was performed by observing whether they solved the task gradually or not, i.e., whether they wrote the program in parts while also testing their work in the meantime, or whether they tested it for the first time only after they had written the bulk of the solution. In the context of the solution of the MOOC summary task, one can observe that the seven learners who spent the most time and had the greatest number of error messages and repetitive error messages did not work in a gradual style. It is possible that recommending a gradual solution process can help beginners to better understand their code and find errors. It can reduce situations with many concurrent errors in the code making it difficult to understand why any specific error message was generated.","2165-9567","978-1-7281-0930-5","10.1109/EDUCON45650.2020.9125134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9125134","Student profiling;Python error message;log file;Thonny;introductory programming;MOOC","Computer aided instruction;Codes;Electronic learning;Conferences;Debugging;Programming;Task analysis","","4","","16","IEEE","25 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nonetheless, crash reports often lead to a huge amount of information, being necessary to consolidate the crash report data into groups, according to a set of well-defined criteria. Recent research work have proposed different criteria and techniques to group crash report data, making more effective the process of finding the root causes of a bug and showing the performance of the approaches in the context of open source applications (such as IDEs and web browsers). In spite of that, it is still not clear how these approaches perform in other application domains, such as enterprise systems. In this paper, we present an industrial study in this field. We tailor existing approaches to find and group correlated crash reports, and identify buggy files in the domain of web-based systems. We then evaluate the performance of the resulting criteria and technique in industrial settings - identifying and ranking the classes that are more likely to contribute to a crash and thus might need a fix. We also check if the methods changed by the developers to fix a bug are present in the stack traces of the crash report groups used to identify the buggy classes. Our study provides new pieces of evidence of the potential use of crash report groups to indicate buggy classes and methods using stack traces information. For instance, we successfully identify buggy classes with recall varying from 61.4% to 77.3%, considering the top 1, top 3, top 5, and top 10 suspicious buggy files identified and ranked by our approach. We also found that 80% of changed methods from the closed bug fix issues appeared in related stack traces of the crash report groups. Finally, the approach also received positive response from the project leaders of the evaluated projects to help their bug resolution processes.","2576-3148","978-1-7281-5619-4","10.1109/ICSME46990.2020.00086","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9240677","Software crash;Bug Correlation;Bug localization;Crash reports;Stack traces","Software maintenance;Conferences;Computer bugs;Browsers;Data mining","","3","","26","IEEE","2 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In terms of software, we write the programs that read the sensor values and send the packets through the Arduino IDE, and these packets will be transferred to the Microsoft SQL Server database. Lastly, we build a network platform through the ASP.Net of Microsoft Visual Studio. Meantime, we use Android Studio to write the mobile APP. The information will be announced and pushed in multiple ways. The network architecture uses the local area network (LAN) to transmit data. The monitored messages are transmitted to the cloud, and then announce the messages through the background program. In the design of the field, we use the tree topology. The tree topology is a hierarchical centralized control network. Compare to the topology, the communication line of tree topology is short and low cost, and the search path is convenient and easy to expand.","","978-1-7281-8712-9","10.1109/ECBIOS50299.2020.9203628","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9203628","Environmental Internet of Things;Micro Sensors;Air Quality Index;Environmental Index Announcement Platform","Monitoring;Air quality;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Indexes;Servers","","","","9","IEEE","22 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, monitoring water quality in urban areas is crucial, and this has been accomplished via a system that employs Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) approaches. This paper analyses water properties and predicts if the water is safe to consume. The TDS & turbidity sensors are dipped in different water samples collected from tanks, submersibles, water towers, underground water, & other places, which helps to receive data in real-time. The information is first updated in the Arduino IDE before being uploaded to a cloud server. This real-time data is tested & validated on the model designed using different ML models like Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boost. The maximum accuracy achieved using XGBoost is 96.12%. After testing, we will be able to establish whether the water is safe to drink by utilising binary indicators of 1 and 0, where 1 indicates that the water is safe to drink and 0 indicates that it is not.","","979-8-3503-3800-3","10.1109/IC2E357697.2023.10262502","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10262502","Turbidity;TDS;Internet of Things;Machine Learning Models;Micro-controller","Support vector machines;Urban areas;Water pollution;Real-time systems;Data models;Internet of Things;Monitoring","","","","20","IEEE","29 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Asking for the help of colleagues, browsing the official documentation, or accessing online resources, such as Stack Overflow, can clearly help in this ""code comprehension"" activity that, however, still remains highly time-consuming and is not always successful. Enhancing this process has been addressed in different studies under the subject of automatic documentation of software artifacts. For example, ""recommender systems"" have been designed with the goal of retrieving and suggesting relevant pieces of information (e.g., Stack Overflow discussions) for a given piece of code inspected in an IDE. However, these techniques rely on limited contextual information, mainly solely source code. Our goal is to build a context-aware proactive recommender system supporting the code comprehension process. The system must be able to understand the context, consider the developer's profile, and help her by generating pieces of documentation at whatever granularity is required, e.g., going from summarizing the responsibilities implemented in a subsystem, to explaining how two classes collaborate to implement a functionality, down to documenting a single line of code. Generated documentation will be tailored for the current context (e.g., the task at hand, the developer's background knowledge, the history of interactions).

This paper, therefore, sought to solve the problem of misidentification of snake species which often leads to envenoming, and mishandling of snake species by harnessing the power of CNNs together with the portability of mobile devices in developing a mobile application that identifies snake species from images almost in real-time. In implementing this system, the CNN model was trained in Google Collab on a custom-tailored dataset. The images in the dataset were sourced from the internet, and were divided into eight classes which represented eight different snake species. The images were annotated using MakeSense.ai, an online data annotation tool. After annotation the images were piped into the YOLOv5 CNN model on Google Collab for model training. The training process yielded an accuracy of 71% for all the eight classes. After training, the model was converted to a Tensorflow Lite model and exported to Android Studio IDE wherein the rest of the application was developed using Java programming language.","","978-1-6654-7576-1","10.1109/ZCICT55726.2022.10046005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10046005","Snake Identification;Convolutional Neural Network;Image Quality Metrics;Dataset;Annotation;Mobile Application","Training;Performance evaluation;Systematics;Annotations;Mobile handsets;Real-time systems;Internet","","2","","12","IEEE","23 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As part of this investigation, a smart contract is developed, which interacts with an external application programming interface (API) and fetches the design layout file from the file storage system. The smart contract developed as part of the research can be adopted in the existing EDA tools for mask making, curtailing the access sought by an adversary in the mask making process. The proposed smart contract is developed using Solidity language, on an online IDE called Remix.

The development of a smart phone broadband healthcare application allows for the provision of online real-time data regarding a patient's physiological state. The system consists primarily of sensors, a data acquisition unit, such as an Arduino, and software (Arduino IDE). The technology monitors and stores the patient's temperature and heart rate, which is then relayed to the doctor's mobile phone, which has the app. As a result, a realtime patient monitoring system powered by the Internet of Things may successfully track a patient's condition and save lives.","","978-1-6654-6414-7","10.1109/SSTEPS57475.2022.00057","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10125419","Arduino;IoT;Health care;Patient;Monitoring;Temperature;Reliable;Sensors;Arduino IDE;Heart Beat;Medical care","Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Patient monitoring;Data acquisition;Software;Sensor systems;Real-time systems","","","","16","IEEE","22 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The development workflow is improved by breaking interfaces into screens which improves user experience and eliminates redundancy. We automate source code generation using templates, string conversion, string replacement, file creation and links between MySQL table details and relationships for smooth database interaction. The advantage of our strategy can be seen from the analysis of completion times on various screens that shows a significant reduction in time spent on development as well as higher productivity. In relation to the other automatic source code generation studies emphasizing on practical applicability, this research becomes substantial.

However, it may introduce potential vulnerabilities that may arise from intercepting passwords due to the inherent insecurity of HTTP communication for data transmission in the development environment and token inexpiration. To address these security concerns, we propose secure authentication for accessing the plant monitoring system’s sensor data. The proposed solution incorporates two-factor authentication (2FA) and JSON web tokens (JWT) approaches to enhance security. The 2FA requires users to provide an additional verification step beyond username and password to access the application. Additionally, JWT enhances security of token-based authentication. By introducing an expiration time to the tokens, the vulnerability associated with token reuse is minimized. Then, we implement and verify the functionality of the proposed solution through system testing.","2158-4001","979-8-3503-2413-6","10.1109/ICCE59016.2024.10444465","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10444465","authentication;authorization;2FA;JWT;IoP;plant monitoring;AWS","System testing;Plants (biology);Authentication;Passwords;Agriculture;Security;Monitoring","","","","6","IEEE","28 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A chatbot is a bot that can be programmed to have a conversation with a human or robotic partner in some natural language such as English or Spanish. While programming their chatbots, students use fundamental CS constructs such as variables, conditionals, and finite state automata, among others. Chatbot uses pattern matching, state of the art lemmatization techniques, and finite state automata in order to provide automatic formative assessment to the students. When an error is found, the formative feedback generated is immediate and task-level. We evaluated Chatbot in two observational studies. An online nation-wide competition where more than 10,000 students participated. And, a mandatory in-class 15-lesson pilot course in three high schools. We measured indicators of student engagement (task completion, participation, self reported interest, etc.) and found that girls engagement with Chatbot was higher than boys for most indicators. Also, in the online competition, the task completion rate for the students that decided to use Chatbot was five times higher than for the students that chose to use the renowned animation and game programming tool Alice.

EPPS problem deals with choosing a set of the best investment projects on social media such that maximum return with minimum risk is achieved. To optimize the EPPS problem on social media, this study aims to develop a hybrid fuzzy multi-objective optimization algorithm, named as NSGA-III-MOIWO encompassing the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) and multi-objective invasive weed optimization (MOIWO) algorithms. The objectives are to simultaneously minimize variance, skewness and kurtosis as the risk measures and maximize the total expected return. To evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid algorithm, the data derived from 125 active E-projects in an Iranian web development company are analyzed and employed over the period 2014-2018. Finally, the obtained experimental results provide the optimal policy based on the main limitations of the system and it is demonstrated that the NSGA-III-MOIWO outperforms the NSGA-III and MOIWO in finding efficient investment boundaries in EPPS problems.

We compare Docker versus VM deployments of an Apache Spark application in regard to ease of use in a collaborative development environment. We expect that developing the application in a containerized environment will result in fewer post-deployment tests that fail compared to application versions that are developed in non-virtual or VM environments.

Of the aforementioned, state-sponsored attacks not only pose a significant threat to western financial, educational and healthcare institutions, but also threaten the systems and data utilized by a wide range of government agencies and contractors. The military test community is not immune to these threats either with many currently deployed automatic test equipment (ATE) implementations, across the various maintenance levels from the flightline to the depot, being increasingly vulnerable. A growing number of Organizational Level (O-Level) test sets are now exposed to cyber threats as their architectures and interfaces continue to evolve to meet the ever-growing need for increased processing power and measurement performance. Further, O-Level test sets typically connect to the platform (i.e. aircraft) and as such, pose a much greater cyber-security threat. Physical threats have always existed, even for previous generations of test sets, but the nature of the vulnerabilities has largely shifted to new types of interfaces. Replacing legacy test sets, that were deployed with limited external connectivity and data storage capabilities, with advanced processor-based implementations exposes them to a new set of cyber security concerns including possible vulnerabilities with the operating system, the test development environment, the test executive (sequencer) as well as threats from other new interfaces that could possibly be exploited. This paper will delve into these and other possible vulnerabilities with modern O-Level test set implementations, including the impact from the underlying hardware and software architectures. It will discuss the Department of Defense (DOD) Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) for devices and systems and identify where the STIG requirements apply to O-Level test sets. The analysis will include aspects such as file protections, access control, data encryption, activity logs, user group accounts and privileges, test program set (TPS) event logging and others. The analysis will also cover cyber security benefits from utilizing a cyber-approved integrated test development and test executive environment, and identify techniques to maximize the proper protections for current and future deployments.","1558-4550","979-8-3503-0028-4","10.1109/AUTOTESTCON47464.2023.10296266","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10296266","Cyber Security;Cybersecurity;Armament Test;O-Level Test;IDE","Power measurement;Software architecture;Phishing;Operating systems;Memory;US Department of Defense;Ransomware","","","","10","IEEE","2 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The questions can have various forms: binary (""yes/no""), qualitative - Likert-scale-valued, or quantitative. A flexible survey system should offer a variety of question and/or statement types, as well as a user-friendly interface to reply or verify them. Additionally, the replies should be analyzed by strict statistical and uncertainty handling methods to yield consistent recommendations to the survey stakeholders. The `decision Delphi' is a survey variant that corresponds most strictly to the needs of organizations that look for expert knowledge concerning specific technological, market or other business problems. This type of survey also fits the needs of medical research on future therapy, epidemics, health care issues, etc. Its characteristic feature is the participation of the client's staff or the decision makers themselves. The cloud-based application ForgnosisTM is a modern implementation of a decision Delphi endowed with sophisticated analytic features. We will present its capabilities based on a recent survey and analysis case carried out for the EU Horizon 2020 flagship project MOVING. This system is offered in SaaS mode, with some PaaS functionalities. The latter include a variety of programming tools for designing the organization's customized survey.","","978-1-5386-1326-9","10.1109/SOCA.2017.33","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8241542","online Delphi survey; corporate foresight; multi-round decision Delphi; statistical analysis; group decision support; strategic decision making; echnological scenarios","Statistical analysis;Market research;Software as a service;Stakeholders;Forecasting;Organizations","","3","","23","IEEE","1 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Via external mode the developer is able to monitor all Simulink signals of the deployed model on hardware board during runtime. Manipulation of constant block values is also feasible to e.g. investigate on different controller parameters online. The actual prototype board is fully functional and will now be miniaturized to fit into a modular drive unit. With this unit complex multi-axis systems can be installed, monitored and investigated by simply attaching EtherCAT communication bus and single power supply voltage. Thanks to Simulink development environment the controller code development is very efficient. Since the hardware is reduced to mass electronics components the cost is acceptable.","","978-3-8007-4646-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8403040","","","","1","","","","5 Jul 2018","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

Quantitative analysis of GitHub projects' data suggests that the geographical location significantly explains the pull request acceptance decisions. These observations are in agreement with the perceptions of submitters based on their experiences with bias. Integrators feel that it is easy to work with contributors from the same geographical location and that they encourage contributors from the same geographical location. However, integrators do not feel that contributors from some countries are better at writing pull requests compared to others.","","978-1-4503-4205-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7883366","Empirical software engineering;software process;empirical studies","","","1","","13","","23 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Indeed, the lack of computing power allows that only some AI processes can be performed on edge devices, having also to consider their constrained energy capacity. Moreover, the lack of computing continuum between nodes of the same layer, i.e., edge-to-edge, allows to only operate independently within the layer by sensing the environment where nodes stay. In this paper, we propose a lightweight framework for collaborative nodes with decentralized edge intelligence. Organized like a swarm, the groups of nodes emphasize the edge-to-edge continuum of the device-edge-cloud paradigm. This supports a paradigm shift from programming environments for individual devices to dynamic and cooperating groups of nodes. The nodes’ coordination relays on green overlay and offloading mechanisms. Innovative mesh architectures with mixed topologies allow building overlays for having swarm coordination. Tasks offloading exploits the overlays to balance the swarm in near-real-time, according to forecasted energy consumption. Stemming from the proposed reference architecture, we also discuss a series of open challenges, which we believe represent relevant research directions in the nearest future.","","978-1-6654-6297-6","10.1109/DASC/PiCom/CBDCom/Cy55231.2022.9927883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9927883","Cloud-Edge Continuum;Swarm Computing;Distributed Intelligence;Offloading;Overlay Network;Energy-Aware","Shape;Architecture;Computer architecture;Topology;Sensors;Artificial intelligence;Task analysis","","","","17","IEEE","13 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cloud-based distributed systems are predominantly developed using virtualization technology. However, the requirement of significant resources and issues of interoperability and deployment make it less adopt- able in the development of many types of distributed systems. Dockerization or Docker Container-based virtualization has been introduced in the last three years and gaining popularity in the software development community. Docker has recently introduced its distributed system development tool called Swarm, which extends the Docker Container-based system development process on multiple hosts in multiple clouds. Docker Swarm-based containerized distributed system is a brand new approach and needs to be compared with the virtualized distributed system. Therefore, this paper presents the simulation and evaluation of the development of a distributed system using virtualization and dockerization. This simulation is based on Docker Swarm, VirtualBox, Ubuntu, Mac OS X, nginx and redis. To simulate and evaluate the distributed system in the same environment, all Swarm Nodes and Virtual Machines are created using VirtualBox on the same Mac OS X host. For making this evaluation rational, almost similar system resources are allocated to both at the beginning. Subsequently, similar servers nginx and redis are installed on the Swarm Node and Virtual Machine. Finally, based on the experimental simulation results, it evaluates their required resources and operational overheads; thus, their performance and effectiveness for designing distributed systems.","2326-6937","978-1-5090-3852-7","10.1109/MESOCA.2016.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7780130","Virtualization;Dockerization;Distributed Systems;Cloud;Virtual Machine Monitor;Hypervisor;Docker;Virtual Machine;Container","Containers;Virtualization;Virtual machining;Cloud computing;Servers;Computer architecture;Virtual machine monitors","","30","1","38","IEEE","12 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has multiple visual and auditory aids to help its viewers undertake a more engaged position with respect to it, e.g. live video feeds, kiosks as well as live dive shows in order to educate the audience on both the marine ecosystem represented by the exhibit and the importance of conservation. However, there is little aid that gives the audience live and accurate feedback on the species of fish in front of them. It is difficult as a lay person (often even as a professional) to determine the species of fish they are viewing in the exhibit due to the large number of fish species and fish specimens. This shortcoming is poorly addressed in public aquariums and remains an important issue to properly educate visitors on issues such as conservation and ecological diversity. To facilitate solutions to these problems, we present Aquaeye.ai, a platform completed in March 2021, that has taken steps towards greater public engagement and outreach at public aquariums by providing a suite of perception analytics currently including localization and classification for the environments of public aquariums. Using advancements in object recognition and classification for imagery and video data, the practice of transfer learning and modern web development tools, Aquaeye.ai, a cloud-hosted platform, serves models for localization and species classification of fish within the Reef Lagoon exhibit at the California Academy of Sciences (*) using a live webcam of the exhibit. Additionally, it serves data of relevance to ecology and conservation through a simple and powerful interface. We present our curated datasets of and classification/localization models for the fish species within the Reef Lagoon and Philippine Coral Reef exhibits.","0197-7385","979-8-218-14218-6","10.23919/OCEANS52994.2023.10337388","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10337388","fish classification;fish localization;aquarium monitoring;public outreach;computer vision;deep learning;transfer learning","Location awareness;Industries;Visualization;Webcams;Biological system modeling;Transfer learning;Marine vegetation","","","","42","","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yet, learners could benefit from participating in this development, not only for learning vital programming skills, but also skills in creativity and collaboration. Web-based VR (WebVR) has emerged as a platform-independent framework that permits individuals (with little to no prior programming experience) to create immersive and interactive VR applications. Yet, the success of WebVR relies on students' technological acceptance, the intersectionality of perceived utility and ease of use. In order to determine the effectiveness of the emerging tool for learners of varied experience levels, this paper presents a case study of 38 students who were tasked with developing WebVR 'dream' houses. Results showed that students were accepting of the technology by not only learning and implementing WebVR in a short time (one month), but were also capable of demonstrating creativity and problem-solving skills with classroom supports (i.e., pre-project presentations, online discussions, exemplary projects, and TA support). Results as well as recommendations, lessons learned, and further research are addressed.","","978-1-5386-9269-1","10.1109/AIVR.2018.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8613629","Web-based virtual reality, technology acceptance model, course design, student creativity, A-frame","Education;Programming profession;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Software;Virtual reality","","17","","24","IEEE","17 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Intelligent tutoring systems are needed to improve the cyberlearning quality. One of the major difficulties is knowledge representation. The current industry standard is to use Web Ontology Language (OWL) for representing knowledge structure. But OWL only supports one ""first-class"" relation, ""is-a"", between the concepts, and different knowledge areas usually need different custom relations to describe the relations among the concepts. For example ""part-of"" and time dependency are important relations torepresent most engineering knowledge bodies. OWL has to use object properties to emulate such custom relations, leading to awkward knowledge representation hard for domain experts to code, validate and use such knowledge bases. This research uses Pace University's extension to OWL, named Knowledge Graph (KG), to support knowledge representation with custom relations. The instructors can use Pace University extended Protege IDE to declare and apply custom relations in a single document. The instructor teaching experience is also coded in the KG to better support custom learning order by students with different backgrounds. The prototype of a knowledge-driven tutoring system was designed and implemented to illustrate how the KG supports integrated assessments, using assessment results to custom student learning order or material, and let the students freely navigate in the knowledge space from general to specific or the opposite, and following various custom relations. A web technology tutorial is used to validate the design and effectiveness of this approach.","","978-1-5090-0946-6","10.1109/CSCloud.2016.50","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7545929","Custom relations;learning objects;knowledge representation;adaptive learning;intelligent tutoring systems","Semantics;OWL;Navigation;Knowledge representation;Adaptive systems;Context","","5","","25","IEEE","18 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In an effort to slow down the spread of Covid-19, there is a significant rise in digitalization, and this includes voting. However, concerns regarding security and integrity of the entire system have been raised. The implementation of blockchain in voting is believed can help alleviate the issues raised since blockchain are immutable and decentralized. The usage of smart contract that stores states and run when certain conditions are met can get rid of the possibility of database manipulation while still maintaining anonymity. Unfortunately, implementing an Ethereum-based blockchain is expensive as each transaction cost can cost up to thousands of US dollar. Hence, this study focuses on developing an E-Voting blockchain based prototype using a local chain platform that performs the same operations as blockchain but uses a fake currency which results in a more feasible and cost-effective result. In this context, the objectives of this study were to design and develop the smart contract that satisfies the voting requirement and lastly; to evaluate the performance and security of the developed smart contract; to test the functionality of this study’s prototype. The prototype of this study was developed using a combination of Web 2.0, PHP, MySQL, Express.js and Web 3.0, specifically Ganache, Remix IDE and MetaMask. After the development and integration phases, the prototype was evaluated and validated using unit testing, which tested each function and modules individually before being integrated to ensure full functionality of each module. A total of 20 voters were gathered to test the prototype for the user acceptance testing section of the prototype of this study which shows the viability and usability of the product. E-Voting blockchain based prototype successfully achieved the objectives and solved the problems stated in the proposal. Despite the limitations, there are still expected future works to improve the system in future. Blockchain technology has the potential to grow gradually over the next few years and its technological complexity will be able to be adapted by the users.","","979-8-3503-9455-9","10.1109/ICICyTA60173.2023.10428836","Ministry of Higher Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10428836","Smart contract;E-voting;Blockchain;Solidity;Ethereum","Costs;Smart contracts;Prototypes;Blockchains;Complexity theory;Security;Electronic voting","","","","10","IEEE","13 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, the mobile and cloud computing applications, that we refer to as smart agriculture applications (SAAs), can be used in data collection that can be entered directly into the applications by end-users (i.e., farmers) or via sensors. Implementing SAAs is often done using text-based approaches that require advanced skills and experience in software programming. There are low-code development tools (LCDTs) that farmers with less programming experience can use to implement their own SAAs. The LCDTs offer different features and techniques for application development e.g., some employ form-based application specification while others use graphical drag-and-drop techniques. As such, the different LCDTs are best suited for different specific tasks. For instance, a farmer may need to implement an application that connects to sensors to receive data and generate timely notifications when set thresholds are exceeded. However, to the farmer, it can be difficult to know which kind of LCDTs to choose and what category of these tools are best suited for the task. In this paper, we contrast different LCDTs and show how to use DisCoPar to develop SAAs by non-expert programmers. As a contribution, this paper presents properties for LCDTs that can be beneficial to farmers and demonstrates how DisCoPar can be used in developing SAAs.","2153-0033","978-1-6654-1984-0","10.1109/AFRICON51333.2021.9570936","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9570936","pervasive computing;mobile applications;SA applications;distributed computing;visual programming","Cloud computing;Visualization;Software as a service;Prototypes;Programming;Tools;Agriculture","","5","","13","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study provides both quantitative and qualitative assessments of three public code language models when completing real-world code. We first developed an open-source IDE extension, Code4Me, for the online evaluation of the models. We collected real auto-completion usage data for over a year from more than 1200 users, resulting in over 600K valid completions. These models were then evaluated using six standard metrics across twelve programming languages. Next, we conducted a qualitative study of 1690 real-world completion requests to identify the reasons behind the poor model performance. A comparative analysis of the models' performance in online and offline settings was also performed, using benchmark synthetic datasets and two masking strategies. Our findings suggest that while developers utilize code completion across various languages, the best results are achieved for mainstream languages such as Python and Java. InCoder outper-formed the other models across all programming languages, high-lighting the significance of training data and objectives. Our study also revealed that offline evaluations do not accurately reflect real-world scenarios. Upon qualitative analysis of the models' predictions, we found that 66.3% of failures were due to models' limitations, 24.4% occurred due to inappropriate model usage in a development context, and 9.3% were valid requests that developers overwrote. Given these findings, we propose several strategies to overcome the current limitations. These include refining training objectives, improving resilience to typographical errors, adopting hybrid approaches, and enhancing implementations and usability.","1558-1225","979-8-4007-0217-4","10.1145/3597503.3639138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10548973","Automatic Code Completion;Transformers;Language Models;IDE;Evaluation;Open Source;InCoder;UniXcoder;CodeGPT","Training;Analytical models;Codes;Training data;Predictive models;Transformers;Data models","","1","","52","CCBY","14 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the availability of many cloud services built upon these powerful models, there remain several scenarios where developers cannot take full advantage of them, stemming from factors such as restricted or unreliable internet access, institutional privacy policies that prohibit external transmission of code to third-party vendors, and more. Therefore, developing a compact, efficient, and yet energy-saving model for deployment on developers’ devices becomes essential.To this aim, we propose Avatar, a novel approach that crafts a deployable model from a large language model of code by optimizing it in terms of model size, inference latency, energy consumption, and carbon footprint while maintaining a comparable level of effectiveness (e.g., prediction accuracy on downstream tasks). The key idea of Avatar is to formulate the optimization of language models as a multi-objective configuration tuning problem and solve it with the help of a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver and a tailored optimization algorithm. The SMT solver is used to form an appropriate configuration space, while the optimization algorithm identifies the Pareto-optimal set of configurations for training the optimized models using knowledge distillation. We evaluate Avatar with two popular language models of code, i.e., CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT, on two popular tasks, i.e., vulnerability prediction and clone detection. We use Avatar to produce optimized models with a small size (3 MB), which is 160× smaller than the original large models. On the two tasks, the optimized models significantly reduce the energy consumption (up to 184× less), carbon footprint (up to 157× less), and inference latency (up to 76× faster), with only a negligible loss in effectiveness (1.67%).Lay AbstractLarge language models of code have proven to be highly effective for various software engineering tasks, such as spotting program defects and helping developers write code. While many cloud services built on these models (e.g., GitHub Copilot) are now accessible, several factors, such as unreliable internet access (e.g., over 20% of GitHub Copilot’s issues are related to network connectivity [22]) and privacy concerns (e.g., Apple has banned the internal use of external AI tools to protect confidential data [53]), hinder developers from fully utilizing these services. Therefore, deploying language models of code on developers’ devices like laptops appears promising. However, local deployment faces challenges: (1) Consumer-grade personal devices typically lack sufficient memory and the high-performance CPUs/GPUs required for efficient model execution; (2) Even if the hardware requirements are met, deploying the models on many devices can result in considerable energy consumption and carbon emissions, negatively impacting environmental sustainability.To address these challenges, we present Avatar, an innovative approach that optimizes large language models of code and enables their deployment on consumer-grade devices. Avatar can optimize two popular models from a large size of 481 MB to a compact size of 3 MB, resulting in significant reductions in inference time, energy consumption, and carbon emissions by hundreds of times. Our technique effectively lowers the entry barrier for leveraging large language models of code, making them available to ordinary developers without the need for high-performance computing equipment. Furthermore, it also contributes to a more sustainable and user-friendly software development environment.","2832-7616","979-8-4007-0499-4","","National Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10554787","Language Models of Code;Configuration Tuning;Multi-Objective Optimization","Energy consumption;Cloud computing;Codes;Avatars;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Task analysis","","","","86","CCBY","18 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper discusses implementation of a typical MOBA game prototype for Windows platform in a popular game engine Unity 5. The focus is put on using the built-in Unity components in a MOBA setting, developing additional behaviours using Unity's Scripting API for C# and integrating third party components such as the networking engine, 3D models, and particle systems created for use with Unity and available through the Unity Asset Store. A brief overview of useful programming design patterns as well as design patterns already used in Unity is given. Various game state synchronization mechanisms available in the chosen networking engine, Photon Unity Networking, and their usage when synchronizing different types of game information over multiple clients are also discussed. The implemented game retains most of the main features of the modern MOBA games such as heroes with different play styles, skills, team versus team competition, resource collection and consumption, varied maps and defensive structures. The paper concludes with comments on Unity 5 as a MOBA game development environment and execution engine.","","978-953-233-090-8","10.23919/MIPRO.2017.7973661","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7973661","","Games;Servers;Engines;Photonics;Authentication;Computer architecture;Databases","","14","","21","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SIoT is a new paradigm where IoT merges with social networks, allowing people and connected devices as well as the devices themselves to interact within a social network framework. Through an online survey with 60 potential users, we identified eight desired features for the SIoT, which were then clustered into four rule categories that can be programmed by end users and/or imposed by systems. The rules created by end users are used to reason about both devices and people in their social relationships to support automated decisions during runtime. Socialite uses ontology/semantic models for basic/low-level knowledge representation (e.g., device and user) to encapsulate the heterogeneity in devices from various manufacturers, and uses production rules (trigger-action programming) for high-level reasoning. With the ontology model, our reasoning supports both device type automation (e.g., current temperature from a thermostat) and capability-based automation (e.g., current temperature from any devices with the same capability). Furthermore, the Socialite rules leverage social relationships and device capabilities to facilitate collaboration by efficiently sharing configuration and information among users/friends and even with devices from people unknown to a user. In a 24-participant user study (12 with no programming experience), we found that Socialite was easy to learn and use, for both programmers and non-programmers.

Domain experts could leverage the expressiveness of models; implementation details over different hardware could be handled by automatic code generation. In practice, most evidence points to manual code development as the norm, despite several MDE efforts in robotics. Possible reasons for this disconnect are the wide ranges of applications and target platforms making all-encompassing MDE IDEs hard to develop and maintain, with developers reverting to writing code manually. Acknowledging this, and given the opportunity to leverage a large corpus of open-source software widely adopted by the robotics community, we pursue modeling as a complement, rather than an alternative, to manually written code. Our previous work introduced metamodels to describe components, their interactions, and their resulting composition, as inspired by, but not limited to, the de-facto standard Robot Operating System (ROS). In this paper we put such metamodels into use through two contributions. First, we automate the generation of models from manually written artifacts through extraction from source code and runtime system monitoring. Second, we make available an easy-to-use web infrastructure to perform the extraction, together with a growing database of models so generated. Our aim with this tooling, publicly available both as-a-service and as source code, is to lower the MDE barrier for practitioners and leverage models to 1) improve the understanding of manually written code; 2) perform correctness checks; and 3) systematize the definition and adoption of best practices through large-scale generation of models from existing code. A comprehensive example is provided as a walk-through for robotics software practitioners.","","978-1-7281-2536-7","10.1109/MODELS.2019.00-11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8906937","ROS;models;development environments","","","4","","31","IEEE","21 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even though dedicated development environments are in place, a non-expert user might struggle with the over-choice problem in selecting the proper component. By combining MDE and recommender systems, this paper proposes an initial prototype, called ResyDuo, to assist Arduino developers by providing two different artifacts, i.e., hardware components and software libraries. In particular, we make use of a widely adopted collaborative filtering algorithm by collecting relevant information by means of a dedicated data model. ResyDuo can retrieve hardware components by using tags or existing Arduino projects stored on the ProjectHub repository. Then, the system can eventually retrieve corresponding software libraries based on the identified hardware devices. ResyDuo is equipped with a web-based interface that allows users to easily select and configure the under-developing Arduino project. To assess ResyDuo's performances, we run the ten-fold cross-validation by adopting the grid search strategy to optimize the hyperparameters of the CF-based algorithm. The conducted evaluation shows encouraging results even though there is still room for improvement in terms of the examined metrics.","","979-8-3503-2498-3","10.1109/MODELS-C59198.2023.00091","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10350505","Recommendation Systems;IoT development;Model-Driven Engineering","Software libraries;Source coding;Collaborative filtering;Software algorithms;Training data;Writing;Hardware","","","","42","IEEE","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Observing that the major obstacle of scalable state-vector quantum simulation arises from the massively fine-grained irregular data-exchange with remote nodes, in this paper we present SV-Sim to apply the PGAS-based communication models (i.e., direct peer access for intra-node CPUs/GPUs and SHMEM for inter-node CPU/GPU clusters) for efficient general-purpose quantum circuit simulation. Through an orchestrated design based on device functional pointer, SV-Sim is able to abstract various quantum gates across multiple heterogeneous backends, including IBM/Intel/AMD CPUs, NVIDIA/AMD GPUs, and Intel Xeon Phi, in a unified framework, but still asserting outstanding performance and tractable interface to higher-level quantum programming environments, such as IBM Qiskit, Microsoft Q# and Google Cirq. Circumventing the obstacle from the lack of polymorphism in GPUs and leveraging the device-initiated one-sided communication, SV-Sim can process circuit that are dynamically generated in Python using a single GPU/CPU kernel without the need of expensive JIT or runtime parsing, significantly simplifying the programming complexity and improving performance for QC simulation. This is especially appealing for the variational quantum algorithms given the circuits are synthesized online per iteration. Evaluations on the latest NVIDIA DGX-A100, V100-DGX-2, ALCF Theta, OLCF Spock, and OLCF Summit HPCs show that SV-Sim can deliver scalable performance on various state-of-the-art HPC platforms, offering a useful tool for quantum algorithm validation and verification.

To this purpose, different solutions have been proposed ranging from visual paradigms based on mashups to formal languages. However, most of the paradigms proposed in the literature require further external tools to turn application description code into an executable program before the deployment on target devices. Source code generation, runtime upgrades and recovery, and online debugging and inspection are often cumbersome in these programming environments. In this work we describe a methodology for real-time and on-line programming in smart environments that is compact and efficient enough to run on resource-constrained devices. The pillar of the proposed approach is real-time exchange of executable symbolic code in heterogeneous networks. The methodology is supported by an inference engine that is able to generate symbolic code starting from knowledge about hardware devices and their placement in the environment, and about the application domain.

Specifically, a user can record an execution of the program (including user inputs and graphical output), replay the output, and select a specific time interval where the event of interest occurred, to view code that is relevant to this event.

Perseverance com-bines heritage and cutting-edge flight software and hardware to accomplish crucial mission requirements related to Martian surface sampling. The design, development, and operation of NASA's large strate-gic science missions require the ability to communicate space-craft capabilities to hundreds of engineers across multiple dis-ciplines. The interactions between flight and ground software development, Verification and Validation (V&V), Assembly, Test, and Launch Operations (ATLO), and management each demand quick understanding of unique slices of information for each discipline. This information includes the current capabil-ities of the flight system as well as future capabilities and their status as they are developed and tested. Despite the fundamental and critical nature of this information, the flight software dictionaries used to track it are a stumbling block for many projects. These dictionaries provide the cor-nerstone for the interpretation of data sent from the spacecraft, allowing for quick comprehension by engineers on the ground. During both spacecraft development and operations, flight soft-ware dictionary management includes significant challenges due to the large number of interfacing systems and the subtle yet distinct needs of each. The engineering of flight software dictionaries for Mars2020 had numerous challenges, most-notably: parallel dictionary development to support simultaneous separate flight software build campaigns for each mission phase (cruise and surface), managing requests for operations-enabling information without perturbing the heritage interface with the rover, and the intro-duction of new tools by the dictionary stakeholders that forced the dictionary team to innovate and redesign the heritage tool chain. These challenges generated guiding principles for the dictionary development effort: emphasize coding best practices and unit testing in the dictionary code development tool chain, use institutionally provided COTS (commercial-off-the-shelf) tools whenever possible, and maintain the heritage flight-ground interface all while advancing operations-enabling information via a loosely coupled interface. Throughout development and operations, the Mars2020 dictionary toolchain included IBM DOORS Next Generation, GitHub, Microsoft Excel, Docker, Jenkins, and a significant custom-built Python codebase. Significant interfaces included JPL's command and control software, heritage flight software team tools and processes, and the many cloud-based ground tools developed for the mission. This paper will discuss the requirements for the Mars2020 dictionary development, the development team's response to those requirements, lessons learned throughout the process, steps taken towards automated deliveries and continuous integration of stakeholder inputs, potential toolchain improvements for Mars2020, and key takeaways that could be applied to future missions.","1095-323X","978-1-6654-3760-8","10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843621","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9843621","","Space vehicles;Dictionaries;Process control;Systems engineering and theory;Software;Stakeholders;Spreadsheet programs","","","","13","IEEE","10 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The derivation process of these formulas is difficult to follow, and there is a challenge in correlating them to the experimental results, making it difficult for students to understand. In response to the non-open-source nature of Matlab, Python, as a free and open-source programming language, has powerful features and rich third-party library resources, supporting various signal processing methods and algorithms, showing unique advantages and effects. Currently, existing experimental simulation platforms for signal courses are often designed for a certain type of course, such as Digital Signal Processing, Communication Principle, Signals and Systems, etc. These platforms only provide limited cases and experiments, and the course content they cover is relatively single and independent, lacking the connection and integration of knowledge points between different courses. To improve this situation, this article chose PyQt5 as the development tool library, with its excellent performance and rich resources, to design and develop an experimental simulation platform for signal-class courses. This platform closely follows the teaching syllabus and divides the platform into multiple modules according to the division of teaching content. Each module contains corresponding course knowledge points and experimental simulations. The platform also has various teaching service functions such as online self-study and teaching guidance, which can help teachers make teaching more vivid and interesting, and can also help students better understand abstract theories and concepts.

A major concern though is the improper and insecure uses of the language by application developers, motivating the development of various static analyses that detect security vulnerabilities in PHP programs. However, many of these approaches do not handle recent, important PHP features such as object orientation, which greatly limits the use of such approaches in practice. In this paper, we present OOPIXY, a security analysis tool that extends the PHP security analyzer PIXY to support reasoning about object-oriented features in PHP applications. Our empirical evaluation shows that OOPIXY detects 88% of security vulnerabilities found in micro benchmarks. When used on real-world PHP applications, OOPIXY detects security vulnerabilities that could not be detected using state-of-the-art tools, retaining a high level of precision. We have contacted the maintainers of those applications, and two applications' development teams verified the correctness of our findings. They are currently working on fixing the bugs that lead to those vulnerabilities.","2470-6892","978-1-5386-3238-3","10.1109/SCAM.2017.20","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8090150","php;dynamic languages;object-oriented programming;security;analysis","Tools;Static analysis;Feature extraction;Computer architecture;Benchmark testing","","5","","24","IEEE","2 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Shi",UMD; UMD; Cornell,2018 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP),"26 Jul 2018","2018","","","944","961","Many cloud and cryptocurrency applications rely on verifying the integrity of outsourced computations, in which a verifier can efficiently verify the correctness of a computation made by an untrusted prover. State-of-the-art protocols for verifiable computation require that the computation task be expressed as arithmetic circuits, and the number of multiplication gates in the circuit is the primary metric that determines performance. At the present, a programmer could rely on two approaches for expressing the computation task, either by composing the circuits directly through low-level development tools; or by expressing the computation in a high-level program and rely on compilers to perform the program-to-circuit transformation. The former approach is difficult to use but on the other hand allows an expert programmer to perform custom optimizations that minimize the resulting circuit. In comparison, the latter approach is much more friendly to non-specialist users, but existing compilers often emit suboptimal circuits. We present xJsnark, a programming framework for verifiable computation that aims to achieve the best of both worlds: offering programmability to non-specialist users, and meanwhile automating the task of circuit size minimization through a combination of techniques. Specifically, we present new circuit-friendly algorithms for frequent operations that achieve constant to asymptotic savings over existing ones; various globally aware optimizations for short- and long- integer arithmetic; as well as circuit minimization techniques that allow us to reduce redundant computation over multiple expressions. We illustrate the savings in different applications, and show the framework's applicability in developing large application circuits, such as ZeroCash, while minimizing the circuit size as in low-level implementations.","2375-1207","978-1-5386-4353-2","10.1109/SP.2018.00018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8418647","Verifiable Computation","Logic gates;Optimization;Minimization;Program processors;Programming;Cryptography;Task analysis","","53","1","49","IEEE","26 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our data analysis indicates that procedural abstraction is a concept that is learned over time by some App Inventor users, but it is used relatively infrequently, and features like parameters and returning values are used even more rarely. Procedures are most frequently called only once, indicating that they are often used to organize code rather than to reuse it.

The low power consumption, small form factor and I/O interface capabilities of SBCs with sensors and actuators makes them ideal in embedded and real-time applications. However, most SBCs run non-realtime operating systems based on Linux and Windows, and do not provide a user-friendly API for application development. This paper presents QduinoMC, a multicore extension to the popular Arduino programming environment, which runs on the Quest real-time operating system. QduinoMC is an extension of our earlier single-core, real-time, multithreaded Qduino API. We show the utility of QduinoMC by applying it to a specific application: a web-connected 3D printer. This differs from existing 3D printers, which run relatively simple firmware and lack operating system support to spool multiple jobs, or interoperate with other devices (e.g., in a print farm). We show how QduinoMC empowers devices with the capabilities to run new services without impacting their timing guarantees. While it is possible to modify existing operating systems to provide suitable timing guarantees, the effort to do so is cumbersome and does not provide the ease of programming afforded by QduinoMC.","","978-1-5090-5269-1","10.1109/RTAS.2017.39","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7939017","","Printers;Three-dimensional displays;Real-time systems;Linux;Timing;Printing;Operating systems","","4","","20","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although this symbiotic relationship between robotics and programming is perceived as largely beneficial, educational approaches often feel the need to hide the underlying complexity of the robotic system, but as a result fail to transmit the reactive essence of robot programming to the roboticists and programmers of the future. This paper presents ROSY, a novel language for teaching novice programmers through robotics. Its functional style is both familiar with a high-school algebra background and a materialization of the inherent reactive nature of robotic programming. Working at a higher-level of abstraction also teaches valuable design principles of decomposition of robotics software into collections of interacting controllers. Despite its simplicity, ROSY is completely valid Haskell code compatible with the ROS ecosystem. We make a convincing case for our language by demonstrating how non-trivial applications can be expressed with ease and clarity, exposing its sound functional programming foundations, and developing a web-enabled robot programming environment.","","978-1-7281-5237-0","10.1109/IRC.2020.00045","FEDER; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9287888","robot programming;functional reactive programming;introductory programming;functional programming","Training;Symbiosis;Software;Functional programming;Programming profession;Physics;Robot programming","","","","25","IEEE","24 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system is built with ROS, a popular robotics framework, and operates on the Ubuntu 20.0 virtual OS running on a MacOS Monterey host system, which provides an energy-efficient robotics hardware. The method employed in this study, Lidar-SLAM, creates a 2D representation of the environment and evaluates the robot's location and direction by analysing the point cloud data captured by the Lidar sensor. The robot has a differential drive system, which allows it to move and turn precisely in small places. The Arduino uno microcontroller present on the differential drive communicates with ROS via a USB serial peripheral between the Arduino and macOS host system. The proposed system has the potential to undergo real-world testing by placing the robot in an unfamiliar location and evaluating its performance based on how accurately it can localize and map the surroundings. This project provides a low-cost and small solution for mobile robot localization based on Lidar-SLAM technology, which can be scaled and utilized for a variety of applications including warehouse management, surveillance, and inspection. The ROS-based design enables for simple integration with other robotic systems and provides a comprehensive set of robotics development tools.

The classification and comment information is then made available as a hint to those students still trying to solve the problem when they encounter a similar error. Spinoza provides a wide variety of visualizations and dashboards that allow the instructor to closely monitor the progress of the students in this activity and to pivot to another phase of the activity at the appropriate time. It also has features that allow the instructor to easily detect and intervene with students who have failed to demonstrate mastery of the skills and concepts covered in that lesson. Spinoza builds on the ideas behind several other recent systems and this paper demonstrates that the Solve-Then-Debug approach can successfully keep all students actively engaged in learning coding skills even when there is a large range of skills in the class.","","978-1-5090-5920-1","10.1109/FIE.2017.8190519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8190519","","Programming;Debugging;Problem-solving;Tools;STEM","","7","","28","IEEE","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Programming skills vary from person to person and even from language to language. Monitoring the student performance is evident to assess and improve programming skills. Though e-learning courses have paved the way to a different structure of learning, it is way more important to practice under supervision. The proposed model aims to automate the process of lab evaluation and assessment of programming subjects in the curriculum. The basic idea is to bring the IDE of various programming languages(C, C++, Python, Java, C#, goLang, JS) to construct a single platform to write code. The automated platform consists of different types of modules. Faculty module can add, modify or delete questions. According to the sections and subjects allocated, the faculty can observe the performance trends of all the students of the section in a given language. Test cases will be provided for each question. In student module, the student will be able to see all the programming subjects according to the section. Percentage, grades and marks will be provided based on the completion of test cases. Student profile demonstrates the whole details of the student. In admin module, the admin will have access to the overall website, to add faculty and student details. This project is being built using MERN stack web development. This automated tool will be very useful in assessing the students and provide accurate results.","","978-1-6654-5630-2","10.1109/ICAAIC56838.2023.10141192","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10141192","Programming;Software;Web development;Database;MongoDB;React.JS;Node.JS;Express.JS","Java;Codes;Program processors;Electronic learning;Programming;Market research;Software","","2","","20","IEEE","8 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Calibrating Deep Learning-based Code Smell Detection using Human Feedback","H. Nanadani; M. Saad; T.

Software developers may have different opinions and perspectives on smelly code. While many attempts have been made to use deep learning-based models for code smell detection, they fail to consider each developer’s subjective perspective while detecting smells. Ignoring this aspect defies the purpose of using deep learning-based smell detection methods because the models are not customized to the developer’s context. This paper proposes a method that considers human feedback to account for such subjectivity. Towards this, we created a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA and developed a container-based web-server to offer services of our baseline deep learning model. The setup allowed developers to see code smells within the IDE and provide feedback. Using this setup, we conducted a controlled experiment with 14 participants divided into experimental and control groups. In the first round of our experiment, we show code smells predicted using the baseline deep learning model and collect feedback from the participants. In the second round, we fine-tune the model based on the experimental group’s feedback and reevaluate its performance before and after adjustment. Our results show that using such calibration improves the performance of the smell detection model by 15.49% in F1 score on average across the participants of the experimental group. Our work carries implications for both researchers and practitioners. Practitioners can apply our approach to enhance the quality of their code in day-to-day development activities, aligning it with their own code smell definitions. Furthermore, software engineering researchers can leverage this study to adopt analogous approaches for addressing similar issues, including code review.","2470-6892","979-8-3503-0506-7","10.1109/SCAM59687.2023.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10356395","Code smell detection;human feedback;deep learning","Deep learning;Geography;Feedback loop;Codes;Source coding;Organizations;Predictive models","","1","","55","IEEE","20 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using this technology intelligent transportation systems (ITS) can be developed, whose main purpose is to ensure more safety, faster travel, reduced energy consumption and improved vehicle upkeep. Devices connected within the IoV transmit a vast amount of data, which leads to additional costs on the communication network along with data security concerns. This research considers the potential uses of blockchain technology for improving communication between independent vehicles. In this paper, a decentralized system is proposed to enhance the security and performance of financial transactions in the network of autonomous cars based on the Ethereum blockchain. Our system is divided into two modules: car registration and message alert generating. New vehicles are allowed on the network using the smart contract that has been written and published on the Ethereum Remix IDE. This is the contract code attached to the Metamask wallet. Another module, the message alert-generating module, allows an administrator to send alert messages to all registered cars via a web-based system to their wallet for an Ethereum gas cost. It ensures the reliability of data transferred between the self-driving cars through the use of blockchain-based systems. The data is, therefore, confirmed and vetted using the proof of work and stake consensus algorithm to bring out the truth. The transaction being made, the system will see to it that the transaction made is of integrity and trustable. By synching all these technologies and means of reaching an agreement, the blockchain secures not only the means of keeping and retaining the information of the kept within self-driving vehicles but also establishes a strong foundation of highest trust and transparency in the interaction between the vehicles on the network. Accordingly, a well-defined and reliable conceptual design for the communication systems of autonomous vehicles has been proposed. Future work and the unresolved issues of using blockchain for autonomous vehicles have also been deliberated over in detail.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3431279","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10604867","Access Control;Enhanced Trust;Internet of Vehicles;Blockchain;Decentralized;Ethereum;Consensus","Blockchains;Smart contracts;Security;Cryptocurrency;Open source software;Automobiles;Internet of Vehicles;Access control;Trusted computing;Decentralized applications","","","","","CCBYNCND","19 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

We compared the frequency as well as the sequence patterns of used information sources both for the developers using coupled change suggestions and those not using them. We found a set of information sources where the developers seek for help and identified two categories of relevance. Also, we discovered that for the tasks using coupled change suggestions, the developers used mostly the internal IDE elements as an information source whereby the developers not using coupled change suggestions often used external sources like the documentation or the web. Coupled change suggestions influence the strategy how the developers seek for help by reducing the search for information on external locations which makes the process of solving maintenance tasks more compact.","","978-1-5386-0592-9","10.1109/QRS.2017.50","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8009944","Coupled files;Data Mining;Software Repositories;Help Seeking;Software Maintenance","Maintenance engineering;Data mining;Documentation;Videos;Encoding;Software systems","","","","47","IEEE","14 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We use an existing modularity based community detection algorithm and we extend it by inserting a post-processing step that eliminates graph edges based on users' personality. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by sampling the Twitter graph and comparing the communication strength of the extracted communities with and without considering the personality factor.

This is due to FPGA's high reconfigurability and improved user-friendly programming environment. OpenCL, supported by major FPGA vendors, is a high-level programming platform that liberates hardware developers from having to deal with the complex and error-prone HDL development. While OpenCL exposes a GPU-like programming model, which is well-suited for compute-intensive tasks, in many state-of-art systems that deploy FPGA, we observe that the workloads are streaming-like, which is communication-intensive. This mismatch leads to low throughput and high end-to-end latency. In this paper, we propose ST-Accel, a new high-level programming platform for streaming applications on FPGA. It has the following advantages: (i) ST-Accel adopts the multiprocessing programming model to capture the inherent pipeline-level parallelism of streaming applications while reducing the end-to-end latency. (ii) A message-passing-based host/FPGA communication model is used to avoid the coherency issue of shared memory, thus enabling host/FPGA communication during kernel execution. (iii) ST-Accel provides a high-level abstraction for I/O devices to support direct I/O device access that eliminates the overhead of host CPU and reduces the I/O latency. (iv) ST-Accel enables the decoupled access/execute architecture to maximize the utilization of I/O devices. (v) The host/FPGA communication interface is redesigned to cater to the demands of both latency-critical and throughput-critical scenarios. The experimental results on the Amazon AWS cloud and local machine show that ST-Accel can achieve 1.6X-166X throughput and 1/3 latency for typical streaming workloads when compared to OpenCL.","2576-2621","978-1-5386-5522-1","10.1109/FCCM.2018.00011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8457626","FPGA;OpenCL;Programming Platform;Streaming","Field programmable gate arrays;Kernel;Programming;Random access memory;Hardware design languages;Acceleration;Throughput","","16","","28","IEEE","11 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Crucially, Depot implements lazy evaluation of these transformations so that only the structured data that is demanded by a data consumer is generated. Until the structured data is ""materialized,"" Depot tracks and maintains the dependencies that are required to perform the eventual materialization. This lazy approach to creating structured data allows Depot to maintain a smaller resource footprint compared to a typical data warehouse approach while maintaining the flexibility of the data lake model.

It can provide opportunities to read others' code, learn how features can be implemented using the Scratch language, and contribute to the program. It can also prevent students from engaging with the code if they copy an existing program that does what they are trying to do without needing modification. The literature shows mixed results regarding use of remixes in Scratch. We have investigated at a large scale what happens in practice by analysing thousands of student programs shared through the Scratch online repository. As well as replicating prior work on a larger scale to show the impact of remixing on learning programming skills through Lines of Code (LOC) and repertoire of block usage, we also measure the use of elementary patterns (common combinations of commands).

The aim of this study is to dissect and analyze a collection of 775 negative and 557 positive comment reviews, drawn from four distinct e-commerce platforms. By classifying these remarks into positive and negative sentiments, this research endeavors to illuminate underlying trends permeating these marketplaces. The research methodology employed involves field observations of online shopping experiences, utilizing data derived from 254 e-commerce customers. These data were collected via validated questionnaires and subsequently analyzed using the partial least squares structural equation modeling approach, employing the lavaan r library within the R programming environment. The questionnaire results produced a rating scale from 1 to 5, categorizing responses from “very satisfied” to “less satisfied”, effectively illustrating both positive and negative commentary. The field comment data collected was coordinated with comment data extracted from four marketplace trading accounts. This data comment customer was analyzed using a range of comparative models such as k-nearest neighbors, multinomial naive bayes, stochastic gradient descent, and decision trees to conduct sentiment analysis.

An important challenge in IoV design lies in the efficient execution of data storage and sharing mechanisms. The successful implementation of blockchain technology across various disciplines has sparked intrigue amongst researchers to unearth its potential applicability within the IoV context. In the related works, Blockchain-based IoV systems are usually composed of three layers: the vehicle layer, the roadside units (RSUs) layer, and the blockchain or cloud layer. The RSUs layer is often required to perform numerous tasks throughout the system. Stability during rush hours is worth considering. RSUs need to receive a lot of data during rush hours and may also undertake data computing tasks. Based on the characteristics of distributed ledges, the issue of substantial storage overhead looms as a complex problem with the escalating size of the block list. Although some solutions are being proposed, such as fragmented ledger, there are still security concerns. Data security cannot be guaranteed while reducing storage overhead. To combat the stability and cost concerns associated with Roadside Units (RSUs), we delegate the majority of RSU functionalities to other layers of the system. Further, we incorporate a secure blockchain strategy – deploying an outer and inner blockchain to fortify the security and resilience of the overall blockchain network. Based on the autonomous execution characteristics of smart contracts, we try to use smart contracts for data transmission. We use Solidity to write the smart contract and test it on the Remix IDE with the aim of testing the smart contract's operability in terms of data transmission. We scrutinise the data transmission process via smart contracts, and the empirical results corroborate the effectiveness of our uniquely designed process.","","979-8-3503-3101-1","10.1109/IMCOM60618.2024.10418375","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10418375","IoV;blockchain;smart contract;fragmented ledger;shared ledger","Smart contracts;Blockchains;Data communication;Task analysis;Thermal stability;Internet of Vehicles;Testing","","","","19","IEEE","12 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To improve the system performance, it is necessary that the Cloudlets scheduled on the resources available must be efficiently executed. For scientific applications, workflow scheduling is a significant issue. To handle this issue, a new mechanism called Enhanced Min-Min (E-Min-Min) is introduced inspired by the Min-Min algorithm. This scheduling algorithm not only schedules the jobs according to their completion time but considers the data transfer time too with equal priority and makes an aggregated function for scheduling of jobs to the best suitable resources. During the scheduling process, the main focus is on the minimization of Makespan, maximize the resource utilization and load balance level and also minimize the cost of scheduling. Workflow scientific applications such as Montage, Cybershake, InSpiral, SIPHT are considered. In workflow the tasks are represented as nodes and their dependencies represents the relationships among them. WorkflowSim simulator with Net Beans IDE is used to create the simulation environment and the results are validated over it.

Duplo positions the program for each arm side-by-side, using the spatial relationship between blocks from each program to represent parallelism in a way that end-users can easily understand. This design was proposed by previous work, but not implemented or evaluated in a realistic programming setting. We performed a randomized experiment with 52 participants that evaluated Duplo on a complex programming task that contained several sub-tasks. We compared Duplo with RobotStudio Online YuMi, a commercial solution, and found that Duplo allowed participants to solve the same task faster and with greater success. By analyzing the information collected during our user study, we further identified factors that explain this performance difference, as well as remaining barriers, such as debugging issues and difficulties in interacting with the robot. This work represents another step towards allowing a wider audience of non-professionals to program, which might enable the broader deployment of robotics.","1558-1225","979-8-4007-0217-4","","NSF(grant numbers:2024561); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10548642","two-armed;robots;end-users;block-based;programming","Visualization;Robot kinematics;Parallel processing;Manipulators;Industrial robots;Task analysis;Usability","","","","49","","14 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, its implementation for robust operation remains challenging because of process nonlinearity and time-variant characteristic, higher energy consumption, excess sludge produced, and biomass loss during sludge pumping. Also, sensor failure, process startup, and shut down present additional difficulties. In this article, an intelligent human–machine interface using an advanced numerical solution for a knowledge-based system (called ANKSys) was developed by integrating the fully optimized-functionality (soft sensing, decision making, and simulating model) data driven by supervisory control. This control consists of advanced algorithms (artificial neural network, Kalman filter, principal component analysis, least-square technique/renowned root-mean-squared error) using commercial software (MATLAB R2018a, Microsoft Visual Studio IDE 2016, Microsoft SQL Server 2014, OPC Automation with XGT series programmable logic controller). The developed ANKSys can help in online monitoring and optimal process operation by assessing risk and failure occurrences, acquiring data for data analysis, and managing operating expenditure. In real-time implementation, ANKSys enhanced the energy efficiency, i.e., 16% of a pilot-scale “LEAOX” wastewater treatment plant located at Daegu, Republic of Korea.

The proposed work is performed in three stages: In the first stage, development of an adaptive VLE that collects learning analytics and enables the educator to parametrize (turn on/off) their collection. The output of these analytics gets stored for further processing. In the second stage, data analysis and processing has been performed for the collected information. In the third stage, the results have been used as an input to adaptive VLE to enable informed personalisation of the student learning path and other adaptations. In this paper, we have proposed the combined use of two different environments for the different stages to achieve the most from their specialisation. For the first and the third stage, the MPS Jetbrains environment for the development of a domain-specific language (DSL) for adaptive VLEs was utilised. This development environment assists the creation of a new DSL that will enable educators to focus on the domain aspects and configure their adaptive VLE implementation to their needs. For the second stage of data analysis, the weka library was used to process the data, apply a range of classification algorithms and produce/store results that can then be used as an input to the adaptive VLE DSL. Overall, the proposed frameworksystem is anticipated to isolate the domain problem from the corresponding implementation details of web development and data analysis and give the adaptive VLE developer a seamless environment to experiment with a very quick turn-around time with ideas in their domain. More automation and integration between the VLE and the data science algorithms utilised for learning analytics data are part of our future plans towards the greater vision of more autonomic and personalised VLEs.","","978-1-7281-1460-6","10.1109/NEXTCOMP.2019.8883640","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8883640","eLearning;adaptive VLE;DSL;classification algorithms;weka library","DSL;Data analysis;Adaptation models;Domain specific languages;Libraries;Data collection;Unified modeling language","","2","","17","IEEE","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A huge data set (over 4 million records in each source) and its slow manual enrichment (ca 7,000 records processed so far) pose issues of quality, scalability, and creates the need for a quality assurance technology that is accessible to non-programmers. An important goal for the researcher community is to produce a reusable, high-level quality assurance tool for the ingested data that is domain specific (historic data), highly portable across data sources, thus independent of storage technology.This paper outlines the step-wise design of the finer granular digital format, aimed for storage and digital archiving, and the design and test of two generations of the techniques, used in the first two data ingestion and cleaning phases.The first small scale phase was exploratory, based on metadata enrichment transcription to Excel, and conducted in parallel with the design of the final digital format and the discovery of all the domain-specific rules and constraints for the syntax and semantic validity of individual entries. Excel embedded quality checks or database-specific techniques are not adequate due to the technology independence requirement. This first phase produced a Java parser with an embedded data cleaning and evaluation classifier, continuously improved and refined as insights grew. The next, larger scale phase uses a bespoke Historian Web Application that embeds the Java validator from the parser, as well as a new Boolean classifier for valid and complete data assurance built using a Model-Driven Development technique that we also describe. This solution enforces property constraints directly at data capture time, removing the need for additional parsing and cleaning stages. The new classifier is built in an easy to use graphical technology, and the ADD-Lib tool it uses is a modern low-code development environment that auto-generates code in a large number of programming languages. It thus meets the technology independence requirement and historians are now able to produce new classifiers themselves without being able to program. We aim to infuse the project with computational and archival thinking in order to produce a robust data set that is FAIR compliant (Free Accessible Inter-operable and Re-useable).","","978-1-7281-6251-5","10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9378148","Irish Research Council; Science Foundation Ireland; Irish Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9378148","Data Collection;Data Analytics;Model-Driven Development;Historical Data;Data Parsing;Data Cleaning;Ethics;Data Assurance;Data Quality","Java;Quality assurance;Semantics;Big Data;Tools;Syntactics;Cleaning","","2","","34","IEEE","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, all most attempts have shortcomings, as a result, the grid tends not to meet the load demand effectively and most economically in terms of everchanging anticipated load. This study aims to propose an efficient solution for energy consumption and reduction in residential dwellings. This paper presents a hardware implementation of a smart power consumption monitoring device (a standard/peak load control technique) for household load activities in a laboratory experimental test environment. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the practicality of the developed meter/monitor and its efficacy in terms of its ability to capture/record energy information down individual appliance levels; the remote switching of loads; the remote control of loads (load priority classifications); the meter's ability to set the maximum demand limit; and lastly, the developed smart monitor is expected to provide a remote two-way communication between the utility and the user. In this study part of the circuit was simulated using Proteus Simulation, an online internet communication protocol. While the other part consists of the use of offline mode components. Atmel Studio 7 IDE software was used for the writing of the software code. Furthermore, the design operation performance was carried out using Simulink in MATLAB environment and MATLAB graphics. Three types of loads, namely, resistive, capacitive, and inductive loads were used to test the proposed technique adeptness. The results obtained demonstrated the proficiency of the developed monitoring device, this includes the ability to capture the individual appliance energy information, switch and control loads, and set desired maximum demand limit. Based on the test outcomes, the smart control technique is viable and can contribute towards reducing the strain on the grid while reducing household energy consumption due to improved demand utilization (usage).","","978-1-6654-4231-2","10.1109/ICECET52533.2021.9698529","Centre for Energy and Electric Power (CEEP); Tshwane University of Technology (TUT); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9698529","energy use;smart energy system;end-use appliance prioritization;peak load control technique;smart meter;household load activities","Meters;Home appliances;Energy consumption;Power demand;Switches;Writing;Smart meters","","1","","10","IEEE","11 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Security methods in traditional wireless networks are often specific to single architectures and are therefore ineffective in solving security issues that may surface on hybrid IoT networks. In this paper, we propose a software defined end-edge-cloud network architecture for smart IoT applications. We apply a deep-learning (DL) based intrusion detection system (IDS) to secure this architecture. We implement this system based on the Caffe framework and train several popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) including LeNet, AlexNet, and ResNet-50. We evaluate the performance of this system in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We then investigate the FPGA-based acceleration technique to reduce the training and runtime of CNNs. We implement the FPGA acceleration based on a Xilinx KU115 board which achieves efficient performance per watt while training and deploying the IDS. For accelerating CNNs on the FPGA, we investigate a Winograd convolution engine in the Xilinx SDAccel development environment which offers automation schemes for accelerating computations.

Much of this data takes the form of time series, and in response, there has been increasing interest in the creation of time series archives in the last decade, along with the development and deployment of novel analysis methods to process the data. The general strategy has been to apply a plurality of similarity search mechanisms to various subsets and subsequences of time series data in order to identify repeated patterns and anomalies; however, the computational demands of these approaches renders them incompatible with today's power-constrained embedded CPUs.To address this challenge, we present FA-LAMP, an FPGA-accelerated implementation of the Learned Approximate Matrix Profile (LAMP) algorithm, which predicts the correlation between streaming data sampled in real-time and a representative time series dataset used for training. FA-LAMP lends itself as a real-time solution for time series analysis problems such as classification and anomaly detection, among others. FA-LAMP provides a mechanism to integrate accelerated computation as close as possible to IoT sensors, thereby eliminating the need to transmit and store data in the cloud for posterior analysis.At its core, LAMP and FA-LAMP employ Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) to perform prediction. This work investigates the challenges and limitations of deploying CNNs on FPGAs when using state-of-the-art commercially-supported frameworks built for this purpose, namely, the Xilinx Deep Learning Processor Unit (DPU) overlay and the Vitis AI development environment. This work exposes several technical limitations of the DPU, while providing a mechanism to overcome these limits by attaching our own hand-optimized IP block accelerators to the DPU overlay. We evaluate FA-LAMP using a low-cost Xilinx Ultra96-V2 FPGA, demonstrating performance and energy improvements of more than an order of magnitude compared to a prototypical LAMP deployment running on a Raspberry Pi 3.

Connected IIOT with FOTA can deliver significant value by decreasing capital investments, enabling customizable functionalities, or improving operational efficiencies. FOTA also increases exposure to threats targeting critical infrastructure, which could lead to safety or mission damage (i.e., failures could result in loss of life or loss of critical functions). This paper presents a security baseline for FOTA by creating a secure “pipeline” for IIOT firmware. It first provides a generic reference architecture that defines connections between the IIOT device, a gateway for communication outside the control network, cloud storage and configuration logic, and the device-vendor's development environment. It describes attacks against various aspects of the reference architecture and explains the security controls that the device-vendor should implement to ensure that the benefits of FOTA for continuous upgradable security and efficiency outweigh the risks from additional exposure. It also provides some follow-on recommendations that utilities should consider before installing IIOT with FOTA capabilities, including: securing the device with secure boot and chain of trust, securing all communication channels with unique endpoint identification and encryption, taking the human out of the build and update processes, and hardening components involved in FOTA for continuous monitoring. This paper emphasizes that these types of connected devices promote a need for a shared responsibility model of cybersecurity.","","978-1-6654-9404-5","10.1109/HST56032.2022.10025441","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10025441","IIOT;FOTA;cybersecurity;OT security;firmware security;digital transformation;shared responsibility","Pipelines;US Department of Homeland Security;Logic gates;Critical infrastructure;Safety;Object recognition;Monitoring","","3","","28","IEEE","30 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study explored its application in solving environmental problems monitoring and risk assessment. GIS application in environmental monitoring has mainly been divided into three aspects: water, soil, and atmosphere. Based on ArcGIS 10.1 software and ArcGIS 9.3.1 version, GIS has been applied in water supply system monitoring and soil heavy metal concentration monitoring, respectively. In addition, it can achieve real-time geographic location information transmission accurately and monitor in various fields by combining the Alibaba Cloud elastic computing service server, user management development environment, real-time data display, wireless sensor network, Arduino microcontroller, and a series of sensors. Combined with the Radial Basis Function Network model and spatial data, GIS technology could monitor and assess the degree of soil wind erosion hazard by quantifying the various indicators of soil wind erosion. GIS can also be applied to assess the environmental risks from water, land, and atmosphere. Based on geological and geomorphological data, the integration of remote sensing and GIS can complete the assessment of flash flood disasters, groundwater exploration, and groundwater pollution. By using the spatial analysis and data processing capabilities of GIS and combined with other technologies or methods such as digital elevation model and Pollution Index, topographic changes, soil properties, and heavy metal pollution can be assessed.

Therefore, they should be detected as reliably and accurately as possible. Black-box monitoring can reliably monitor a target system from a remote host, but it is often coarse-grained and cannot identify the root causes of system faults. In contrast, white-box monitoring can accurately obtain fault information inside a target system, but it is largely affected by system faults. This paper proposes GPUSentinel for more reliable white-box monitoring using general-purpose GPUs. GPUSentinel runs fault detectors in an isolated GPU, which is not easily affected by faults of a target system. For accurate detection, fault detectors in a GPU analyze main memory and directly monitor the state of the operating system. To easily develop such fault detectors, GPUSentinel provides a development environment with LLVM. We have implemented GPUSentinel and seven fault detectors and then confirmed that GPUSentinel could detect various system faults and identify the root causes.","2159-6190","979-8-3503-0481-7","10.1109/CLOUD60044.2023.00072","JST; CREST(grant numbers:JPMJCR21M4,05501); National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), Japan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10254969","operating systems;system faults;fault detection;GPUs;white-box monitoring","Fault diagnosis;Cloud computing;Virtual machine monitors;Fault detection;Operating systems;Graphics processing units;Closed box","","","","19","IEEE","25 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sullivan",NA,Official Google Cloud Certified Professional Cloud Architect Study Guide,"","2020","","","127","150","This chapter covers the key objectives of Professional Cloud Architect Certification exam: designing for security and designing for security legal compliance. The Identity and Access Management (IAM) service is designed to allow you to specify what operations specific users can perform on particular resources. This is also described as specifying “who gets to do what on which resources.” IAM is the recommended way to control access in most cases. In some limited cases, such as in a development environment, the older primitive roles system may be used. An identity is an entity that represents a person or other agent that performs actions on a GCP resource. Identities are sometimes called members. Google accounts are used by people and represent people who interact with GCP, such as developers and administrators. These accounts are designated by an email address that is linked to a Google account. For example, jane.doe@gmail.com could be an identity in GCP. The domain of the email does not have to be gmail.com; it just has to be associated with a Google account. Service accounts are used by applications running in GCP. These are used to give applications their own set of access controls instead of relying on using a person's account for permissions. Service accounts are also designated by email addresses.","","9781119602507","10.1002/9781119602477.ch7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823165.pdf&bkn=9820842&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Engines;Organizations;Law;Access control;Task analysis;Virtual machining","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Therefore, cloud computing and SaaS can help in increasing the productivity of software development efficiently and effectively. The literature study identified 19 factors influencing productivities. We later group these factors into three main factors; process, development environment, and product or services that help maintain a good and improve software development performance. This paper aims to report the validation process results of identified productivity factors using an expert review approach. The expert review process consists of two steps; identify the expert and conduct the evaluation process. Consequently, the experts agree on three main factors with 17 sub-factors.

This study aims to understand how developer sentiment is related to bugs, by analyzing the difference of sentiment between regular and Fix-Inducing Changes (FIC) - changes to code that introduce bugs in the system. To do so, sentiment is extracted from Pull Requests of 6 well known GitHub repositories, which contain both code and contributor discussion. Sentiment is calculated using a tool specializing in the software engineering domain: SentiStrength-SE. Next, FICs are detected from Commits by filtering the ones that fix bugs and tracking the origin of the code these remove. Commits are categorized based on FICs and assigned separate sentiment scores (-4 to +4) based on different preceding artifacts - Commits, Comments and Reviews from Pull Requests. The statistical result shows that FICs, compared to regular Commits, contain more positive Comments and Reviews. Commits that precede an FIC have more negative messages. Similarly, all the Pull Request artifacts combined are more negative for FICs than regular Commits.","2640-0715","978-1-7281-4648-5","10.1109/APSEC48747.2019.00075","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8945613","Software Engineering, Sentiment Analysis, Data Mining","Software;Sentiment analysis;Computer bugs;Task analysis;Tools;Software engineering;Collaboration","","9","","24","IEEE","2 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fully online education is a major trend in education technology of our times. However, it has been criticised for its lack of personalisation and therefore not adequately addressing individual students' needs. Adaptivity and intelligence are elements that could substantially improve the student experience and enhance the learning taking place. There are several attempts in academia and in industry to provide adaptive VLEs and therefore personalise educational provision. All these attempts require a multiple-domain (multi-disciplinary) approach from education professionals, software developers, data scientists to cover all aspects of the system. An integrated environment that can be used by all the multiple-domain users mentioned above and will allow for quick experimentation of different approaches is currently missing. Specifically, a transparent approach that will enable the educator to configure the data collected and the way it is processed without any knowledge of software development and/or data science algorithms implementation details is required. In our proposed work, we developed a new language/framework using MPS JetBrains Domain-Specific Language (DSL) development environment to address this problem. Our work consists of the following stages: data collection configuration by the educator, implementation of the adaptive VLE, data processing, adaptation of the learning path. These stages correspond to the adaptivity stages of all adaptive systems such as monitoring, processing and adaptation. The extension of our framework to include other application areas such as business analytics, health analytics, etc. so that it becomes a generic framework for adaptive systems as well as more usability testing for all applications will be part of our future work.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3029888","research funding allocated directly from British Telecom (Data Science Team in BT Research Headquarters in Adastral Park) to Bournemouth University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9218921","Adaptive VLE;DSL;classification algorithms;learning analytics;eLearning;adaptive systems","DSL;Adaptive systems;Education;Adaptation models;Data collection;Classification algorithms","","8","","34","CCBY","9 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

AI and Data-Driven methods offer flexible alternatives, utilizing historical data for pattern and anomaly identification. Among Electrical Signature Analysis techniques for electrical motor diagnostics, the Space Vector Theory (SVT) is extensively used, while Park’s Vector based diagnostic solutions lack real-time Inter-Turn Short Circuit (ITSC) fault severity assessment, with available techniques often limited to binary classifiers. Implementing AI with SVT for real-time Electric Vehicle (EV) use is underdeveloped, hindered by data scarcity and diverse dataset collection challenges. Real-time simulation, accurate fault modeling, and hardware limitations pose challenges, especially for embedding AI models into processors. To achieve intelligent onboard diagnosis for ITSC fault severity in this paper, a multi-modal approach model is proposed, employing MobileNetV2 to classify Park’s Vector trajectories based on the fault features related to the number of shorted turns. Performance assessments encompass both the standard MobileNetV2 and the proposed multi-modal approach model across various fault severity levels. Furthermore, to address the challenge of limited data availability, an accelerated real-time AI development environment is designed using an FPGA to generate synthetic fault pattern datasets, aligning with the standards of the Electric Vehicle industry. For modeling PMSM with ITSC faults, a fault circuit model is employed. The dataset of 900 Park’s Vector trajectory images is automatically generated by varying the torque request from 10 to 100 Nm with a 10 Nm resolution. At each torque operating point, the motor currents are recorded by adjusting the number of shorted turns. Simulation results confirm the outstanding performance of MobileNetV2 in binary classification, achieving an accuracy of 99.26 %. In case of 5-class ITSC fault severity classification, the prediction accuracy reaches only 72.55 %. The here proposed multi-modal MobileNetV2 model excels, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 99.163 % in the 3-class fault severity classification and 84.907 % in the 5-class classification. These results support the superiority of the proposed multi-modal MobileNetV2 model, which is trained on the generated rich dataset. It outperforms existing Park’s Vector Analysis based ITSC fault detection methods, particularly in early ITSC fault detection as it can detect faults from 6 shorted turns. Additionally, it allows for online fault severity assessment during transient operation and meets stringent requirements for onboard applications. Altogether, the results of investigations prove the presence and extractability of fine detail information in Park’s Vector trajectories, for assessing ITSC fault severity. This contributes to a deeper understanding and analysis of faults in electrical motors through the use of Park’s Vector trajectories.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3344483","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10365165","Rotating electrical machines and drives;PMSM;Park’s vector analysis;electric vehicles;condition-based monitoring;real-time simulation;inter-turn short circuit;fault severity;classification;artificial intelligence","Circuit faults;Fault diagnosis;Induction motors;Feature extraction;Analog circuits;Stator windings;Integrated circuit modeling","","","","63","CCBYNCND","18 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
