This paper introduces an online Web-Lab based system that provides a web integrated development environment (WIDE) for students doing practical programming activities and assignment in a distance learning. The proposed system provides students an editor for writing, editing, updating, compiling and executing their programming code source in the Web. The system is also interactive by introducing tools such Chat-Room, E-Mail, and Forum among learners and instructors interact. The results of using WIDE are very encouraging for enhancing novices students programming skills by allowing them learning and practicing on the web, for instructors to use the recorded information to track the learner's progress.","","978-1-4799-1221-6","10.1109/CISPEE.2013.6701964","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6701964","Web-Lab based compiler;Interactive system;Online practice programming;C language web IDE","Programming profession;Computers;Education;Browsers;Java","","3","","18","IEEE","9 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Next to solid programming skills using the C language (and Assembly) elaborate know-how about the target controller and surrounding hardware is mandatory. Furthermore, setup of the required tooling (compiler infrastructure, debug interfaces, etc.) can be a cumbersome task, especially when supporting multiple different host operating systems. Especially for beginners, this tooling aspect can turn out as an intriguing problem. This paper presents a cloud based integrated development environment (Cloud IDE) for embedded systems based entirely on open-source solutions that has the potential to ease some of these burdens. In contrast to existing solutions it supports flashing and debugging of a target board attached to the local host computer whereas, the entire development takes place in a cloud environment.","","978-1-4799-2280-2","10.1109/MESA.2014.6935577","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6935577","Cloud IDE;embedded systems development;education;Node.js;PaaS","Servers;Hardware;Embedded systems;Debugging;Browsers;Libraries","","2","6","6","IEEE","27 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such an IDE does not leverage the knowledge other team members may have of the design and implementation of the system. We propose to resolve this problem by exploring, experimentally, new ways of inferring knowledge from past IDE-interactions, and of maximizing collaboration among developers. Our approach, called Adinda, revolves around transforming the IDE into a set of integrated services, accessible via a web browser, and enriched with Web 2.0 technologies. Such services will not only help developers perform traditional IDE tasks, but also facilitate the required informal communication and collaboration needs of software development projects. In this paper, we report on our vision, approach and challenges for building Adinda, and initial results.","1558-1225","978-1-60558-719-6","10.1145/1810295.1810330","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062160","IDE;Web 2.0;collaboration;interaction mining;programming environments","Programming;Servers;Software;Data mining;Collaboration;Browsers","","7","","18","","27 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Touch Develop combines a cross-platform browser-based IDE for the creation of mobile cloud apps, an online programmer/user community, and an app store. A central feature of Touch Develop is to track all program edits, versions, runtime information, bugs, as well user comments, questions and feedback in a single cloud-based repository that is available publicly via Web APIs. In this paper, we examine a key feature of Touch Develop that should be relevant to others creating CIDEs, namely the seamless integration of replicated workspaces, simplified version control and app publishing. An analysis of the Touch Develop repository shows that this combination of capabilities allows users to easily create new versions of apps from existing apps, make changes to other users' apps, and share their results from a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets and traditional PCs.","","978-0-7695-5566-9","10.1109/MobileSoft.2015.20","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7283033","","Libraries;Keyboards;Mobile communication;Control systems;Computer crashes;History;Context","","5","1","20","IEEE","1 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The WSDE provides a web-based development environment for software applications that can be executed on a server, local and/or embedded machine. Thus, it is unnecessary for each developer to install software for developing applications on the local system or to set the environment variables of the local system. With the WSDE, developers can use the same environment via a Web browser anytime, anywhere. Moreover, this paper proposes a renewable system for embedded systems. To develop application programs for embedded systems, application developers have to prepare a software development environment for each target embedded system.

While numerous composition approaches have been developed in the past, very little has been done towards tooling. What is clearly lacking is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to ease the process of composition, thereby reducing development time and integration efforts.

Automating the repetitive tasks on Web-based IDEs, regardless of their complexity, would reduce the amount of work that developers must perform to complete the tasks, which would improve the development efficiency of Web applications. In this paper, we put forward a user-friendly approach to automating repetitive tasks on existing Web-based IDEs. The key to the approach is to extend the basic Web-based capture-replay technique with editable and reusable features, which are necessary for automation because some operations are redundant, as well as developers should recognize and define repetitive tasks. Moreover, we develop a supporting tool for the approach. In the case study, we introduce how the approach is used to support automating repetitive tasks on Web-based IDEs.

In this approach discrete software tool functionality is encapsulated in software ""toolets"", accessed as remote Web service-based components. These toolet services are registered and discovered, and then dynamically integrated and invoked from within the JEdit IDE as required.

These tools enable only the shallow integration of the web browser and the IDE. Some tools allow the developer to augment search queries with program entities in the current snapshot of the code. In this paper, we present an in-IDE ambient search agent to bridge the separation of the developer's working context and search context. Our approach considers the developers' working context in the IDE as a time-series stream of programming event observed from the developer's interaction with the IDE over time. It supports the deeper integration of the working context in the entire search process from query formulation, custom search, to search results refinement and representation. We have implemented our ambient search agent and integrate it into the Eclipse IDE. We conducted a user study to evaluate our approach and the tool support. Our evaluation shows that our ambient search agent can better aid developers in searching and using online programming resources while working in the IDE.","1534-5351","978-1-4799-8469-5","10.1109/SANER.2015.7081849","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081849","Context Sensing;Context-Aware Search;Contextual Search Results Annotation","Context;Web pages;Programming;Browsers;Search engines;Google;Libraries","","8","","28","IEEE","9 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditionally, Web service discovery depends on detail formal semantic descriptions of available services. Since a complete detailed service is not always feasible, the client software cannot select the best service offer for a given user goal only by using the static service descriptions. Dynamic discovery based on semantic description of services is an essential aspect of the Semantic Web Service integration process Some data needs to be obtained during run0time because not all data required for service discovery can always be included in service descriptions. This paper shows when and why complete semantic description is unfeasible and it defines the role and position of offer discovery.

This fact -if not considered- can bring automatic ontology development to some non-correct results. In this work we define and analyze a new operator, called Com, with the tools furnished by the method of parametrization and we find that, given a seed S and the induced graph I(S), the community generated by our operator is monotonic with respect to clustering and is denser than the original graph I(S).","2164-7151","978-1-4244-4735-0","10.1109/ISDA.2009.223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5364174","web communities;ontology engineering;complex networks","Ontologies;Automotive engineering;Complex networks;Intelligent systems;Intelligent structures;Facebook;MySpace;Social network services;Vehicle dynamics;Robustness","","","","19","IEEE","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These tests are often recorded and managed by a record and replay tool, such as Selenium IDE. Mining specifications from such tests can be very useful for understanding, verifying, and debugging the system under test. This paper presents an approach to mining a behavior specification from a Selenium IDE test suite such that (a) it captures the behavior of the tests at a high level of abstraction, (b) the behavior can be simulated, and (c) all the tests are completely reproducible from the specification. We first identify similar test actions through context-sensitive clustering so as to normalize the given Selenium IDE tests. Then, we mine patterns of test actions that represent meaningful functions and transform Selenium IDE tests into abstract tests, which are similar to the tests used in the existing model-mining techniques. From the abstract tests, we synthesize a high-level Petri net that captures both temporal constraints and data values. For evaluation purposes, we applied our approach to eight test suites of two real-world systems, Magento (an online shopping system being used by many live stores) and Amazon. Two of the test suites are for security testing, aiming at SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities. The result shows that our approach is effective in producing abstract yet executable specifications and reducing the complexity of the models.","","978-1-4673-2067-2","10.1109/SERE.2012.39","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258316","software testing;test mining;Petri nets;web applications;model-based testing","Abstracts;Computers;Data mining;Graphical user interfaces;Electronic mail;Context;Educational institutions","","2","","20","IEEE","6 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given a specific inspection problem the system is customized by incorporating specific algorithms into each of the sub-systems. In order to illustrate the customization, the paper uses an example of inspection of a nonwoven material. The inspection objective is to quantify the randomness and homogeneity across the material. This task requires using statistical modeling to characterize texture. The paper discusses a theoretical approach based on a Poissonian model, its efficient implementation, and steps required to implement this procedure online.","","0-7803-3612-7","10.1109/ROBOT.1997.620007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=620007","","Inspection;Materials testing;System testing;Quality assurance;Inorganic materials;Plastics;Textiles;Software testing;Decision making;Pulp manufacturing","","6","","9","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

REST's relative simplicity comes from the fact that it not only clearly defines its trade-offs and constraints but also distinctly separates concerns, such as resource identification, resource interfaces, and definitions for interchanged data. This delineation makes it relatively easy for developers designing and building RESTful services to consider and track important issues that can profoundly impact system flexibility, scalability, and performance. REST isn't the answer to all distributed computing and integration problems by any stretch of the imagination, but it can yield highly practical solutions to a variety of such problems, not only on the Web but also within the enterprise.","1941-0131","","10.1109/MIC.2008.130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4670126","RESTful Web development;HTTP;IDEs;hypermedia constraints;conditional GET;toward integration;Steve Vinoski","Web services;Web server;Scalability;Java;Computer languages;Buildings;Distributed computing;Wikipedia;File systems;Internet","","28","6","1","IEEE","11 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Whilst there have been a number of model-based analysis tools reported, there is a lack of integration with development environments to support analysis of these different service artifacts. In this paper we present a short history of some of the analysis tools reported, discuss an appropriate criteria of accessible integrated development with analysis features and provide an example approach, called ""service engineer"" using our tools and integration work.

To facilitate fast Web applications, a scripting approach is one possible solution for software developers. However, then are two major drawbacks for many existing scripting tools. First, most of these scripting tools are proprietary, and only available on chosen platforms. Second, most scripting tools use the Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML) as the basis for extension. To provide extra functionality such as database connection, various extended codes or commands are mixed with HTML tags to produce expected results. However, this dirty approach will make the design and development process more complicated. We propose a systematic and flexible scripting framework for fast Web application development. The two major components, layout script and information-processing script, naturally reflect the static and dynamic properties of a Web application. In addition, the information-processing script can flexibly be split into different component scripts to suit different applications. We built a prototype of a script parser and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) tool to quickly develop an intelligent Web-based Personal Computer Configuration Advisor. Clearly, our proposal opens up many possible directions for investigation including the uses of the IDE tool to develop other applications, and the integration with other components to handle more complicated Web applications.","","0-7695-0577-5","10.1109/WISE.2000.882425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=882425","","HTML;Application software;Web server;Internet;Markup languages;Databases;Information systems;Computer science;Process design;Prototypes","","","20","7","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many of these data stores can easily be accessed programmatically, and do not enforce a schema. Software engineers can design the data model on the go, a flexibility that is crucial in agile software development. The typical tasks of database schema management are now handled within the application code, usually involving object mapper libraries. However, today's Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) lack the proper tool support when it comes to managing the combined evolution of the application code and of the schema. Yet simple refactorings such as renaming an attribute at the source code level can cause irretrievable data loss or runtime errors once the application is serving in production. In this demo, we present ControVol, a framework for controlled schema evolution in application development against NoSQL data stores. ControVol is integrated into the IDE and statically type checks object mapper class declarations against the schema evolution history, as recorded by the code repository. ControVol is capable of warning of common yet risky cases of mismatched data and schema. ControVol is further able to suggest quick fixes by which developers can have these issues automatically resolved.","2375-026X","978-1-4799-7964-6","10.1109/ICDE.2015.7113402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7113402","","Databases;Software;Runtime;Production;Google;Java;History","","17","1","15","IEEE","1 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, a ubiquitous integrated development environment is helpful for students to practice programming anytime and anywhere. To achieve this goal, we develop a novel integrated development environment called Ubi-C for C programming based on Clang and LLVM in this paper. Using this IDE, users can directly write, compile, execute and debug their C programs on Android-based smart phones or tablets. Moreover, this IDE provides the API of multimedia programming, and integrates with cloud services such as Dropbox for storing user programs and data. Consequently, users can easily develop multimedia applications by using C on mobile devices, and can switch their working environments between mobile devices and fixed computers with the support of Dropbox.","","978-1-4799-5079-9","10.1109/DASC.2014.41","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6945686","C programming;Android;mobile devices;Clang;LLVM","Mobile handsets;Programming;Multimedia communication;Androids;Humanoid robots;User interfaces;Registers","","2","","11","IEEE","6 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Distributed Integrated Development Environment for Mobile Platforms (DIMP) is directed towards them with an innovative way to write software programs on the go. Using a mobile device such as a mobile phone or a tablet computer, DIMP is capable of writing source codes and compiling. DIMP consists of a mobile application, a central server and a set of compilation servers, while an administrative web console supports the administrative functions. Together, they comprise DIMP. The mobile application is an android application and provides a rich source code editor integrated to the software. It allows compiling and running of source codes where users can write programs in a selected language. If the source code is error free, a user can expect a worthwhile output whereas an error prone source code would reveal the relevant error message with useful hints for debugging. A further benefit from DIMP is that it allows a user to maintain online work space as well as an offline workspace. Source codes can be shared with other interested users.","","978-1-4673-4463-0","10.1109/ICCSE.2013.6553932","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6553932","cloud computing;service oriented architecture;mobile applications;programming;web services;mobile application development;distributed computing","Servers;Computers;Writing;Androids;Humanoid robots;Computer architecture;Service-oriented architecture","","2","","6","IEEE","15 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These games are often casual, two-dimensional games and do not utilise the specialist graphics hardware which has proliferated across modern PCs and Consoles. Multi-user online game play in these titles is often either non-existent or extremely limited. Computer games applications which grace the current generation of consoles and personal computers are designed to utilise the increasingly impressive hardware power at their disposal. However, these are commonly distributed using a physical medium or deployed through custom, proprietary networking mechanisms and rely upon platform-specific networking APIs to facilitate multi-user online game play. In order to unify the concepts of these disparate styles of gaming, in this paper we propose a novel integrated development environment called Homura and NetHomura. Homura is based on the Eclipse platform and extends the jME game engine, with new interfaces, content and libraries, thus, providing a software suite that integrates source editors, compilers, including spatial and positional editors to afford advanced graphical functionalities within the IDE. We also present two interconnected systems which are implemented using Java Web Start and JXTA P2P technologies, providing a platform-independent framework capable of deploying hardware accelerated cross-platform, cross-browser online-enabled Java games, as part of the NetHomura Project.","","978-1-4244-3756-6","10.1109/MMCS.2009.5256633","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5256633","3D Java Web-Based Game Development;Game Deployment;Game Networking;JXTA and P2P Architecture","Java;Hardware;Application software;Computer graphics;Personal communication networks;Computer applications;Power generation;Microcomputers;Engines;Software libraries","","8","2","25","IEEE","22 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But the number of tools that are used in all phases of the software development life-cycle and their complexity is growing continually. Consequently, the setup and maintenance of current tool chains and development environments requires much effort and consumes a lot of time. One approach to counter this, is to employ web-based systems for development tasks, because centralized systems simplify the administration and the deployment of new features. But desktop IDEs play an important role in software development projects today, and will not be replaced entirely by web-based environments in the near future. Therefore, supporting a mixture of hosted tools and tools integrated into desktop IDEs is a sensible approach. In this paper, we present the SSELab, a framework for web-based project portals that attempts to migrate more software development tools from desktop to server environments, but still allows their integration into modern desktop IDEs. It supports the deployment of tools as hosted services using plug-in systems on the server-side. Additionally, it provides access to these tools by a set of clients that can be used in different contexts, either from the command line, from within IDEs such as Eclipse, or from web pages. In the paper, we discuss the architecture and the extensibility of the SSELab framework. Furthermore, we share our experiences with creating an instance of the framework and integrating various tools for our own software development projects.","2327-0772","978-1-4673-1820-4","10.1109/TOPI.2012.6229812","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6229812","","Servers;Programming;Generators;Context;Computer architecture;Runtime;Portals","","3","","14","IEEE","2 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Almost all modern integrated development environments (IDEs) offer built-in support for automated refactoring tools. However, the user interface for refactoring tools has remained largely unchanged from the menu and dialog approach introduced in the Smalltalk Refactoring Browser, the first automated refactoring tool, more than a decade ago. As the number of supported refactorings and their options increase, invoking and configuring these tools through the traditional methods have become increasingly unintuitive and inefficient. The contribution of this paper is a novel approach that eliminates the use of menus and dialogs altogether. We streamline the invocation and configuration process through direct manipulation of program elements via drag-and-drop. We implemented and evaluated this approach in our tool, Drag-and-Drop Refactoring (DNDRefactoring), which supports up to 12 of 23 refactorings in the Eclipse IDE. Empirical evaluation through surveys and controlled user studies demonstrates that our approach is intuitive, more efficient, and less error-prone compared to traditional methods available in IDEs today. Our results bolster the need for researchers and tool developers to rethink the design of future refactoring tools.","1558-1225","978-1-4673-3076-3","10.1109/ICSE.2013.6606548","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6606548","","Java;Data mining;Usability;Navigation;Keyboards;Irrigation;User interfaces","","18","","29","IEEE","26 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The service portfolio incorporates data from these tools and enables automatic data sharing between them, thereby avoiding setback and redundancy. To accommodate the applications on the cloud, the cloud controller utilizes the resource structures designed in the IDE and generates virtual machines (VMs) from templates, in which a verified OS and middleware for large-scale data processing are packaged.

Within the visualization, developers are able to arbitrarily change the object state, then invoke any method with custom parameters and observe how the object state changes. When changing the source code of the related class, the visualization holds the previous object state and adapts the new behavior defined by the underlying source code. This instantly enables developers to observe functionalities objects of a certain class have and how they manipulate their state, and especially, how source code changes influence their behavior.

Proceedings. 2003","14 Jan 2004","2003","","","192","194","Standard desktop computer applications are becoming increasingly sophisticated, allowing competent users to gain greater levels of efficiency through powerful capabilities. Examples are wide ranging - from simple tailoring of Web-browsers so that frequently used links appear on the toolbar, to writing code to customize the behaviour of a word processor. These interface features promise benefits of end-user programming to those who can access them. To help people access these features, many programming environments have been developed to make programming more accessible. Despite this plethora of developmental research, there has been surprisingly little analytical work in characterising and comparing the capabilities of the environments. This paper presents a methodological analysis of programming environments - particularly educational ones - to shine light on how different languages are used to support three fundamental programming activities. The analysis reveals how programming environments use different languages for the three tasks. We discover that programming environments can be more usable by displaying multiple languages for program representation, but only displaying multiple representations risks creating three cognitive gulfs. To avoid these gulfs, our taxonomy describes why every representation must be editable. Our taxonomy also describes why all languages should be animated when a program is executed. We intend this taxonomy and analysis to be useful for anyone who is building or evaluating a programming environment.","","0-7803-8225-0","10.1109/HCC.2003.1260227","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1260227","","Taxonomy;Programming environments;Programming profession;Writing;Computer applications;Animation;Computer languages;Dynamic programming","","","","15","IEEE","14 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a consequence, these services archive voluminous and potentially useful information to help developers to solve programming-specific issues. Programmers tap into this crowd knowledge through web browsers. This requires them to step out of their integrated development environments (IDE), formulate a query, inspect the returned results and manually port the solution back to the IDE. We present an integrated and largely automated approach to assist programmers who want to leverage the crowd knowledge of Q&A services. We give a form to our approach by implementing Seahawk, an Eclipse plugin. Seahawk automatically formulates queries from the current context in the IDE, and presents a ranked and interactive list of results. Seahawk lets users identify individual discussion pieces and import code samples through simple drag & drop. Users can also link Stack Overflow discussions and source code persistently. We performed an evaluation of Seahawk, with promising results.","1534-5351","978-0-7695-4948-4","10.1109/CSMR.2013.16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6498455","Q&A services;recommendation systems","Engines;XML;Search engines;Java;Software;Navigation;User interfaces","","51","1","32","IEEE","15 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A user (client) of the software uses a browser to operate it while the actual software may be located locally or remotely. Different techniques have evolved with time for implementation of such software within the basic client/server architecture. The initial development environment used a browser (as a client) and a Web server/HTML/CGI (as a server). Of late, technologies like CORBA, DCOM, etc., are becoming popular. Whatever the development environment or implementation technique, such software development is still a tedious job and requires the software developer to be an expert of various technologies. Such scenarios naturally demand a good development tool such that the whole development cycle is small and efficient and the pressure of learning different technologies for a software developer is reduced. We present our effort of designing and implementing such a tool, named IMIS. There are two major components in IMIS: the specification component and the implementation component. In the former, we specify the business process and the latter implements the specification. The core of the specification is the language in which the business process is specified and stored. The implementation component of IMIS will consist of the tools which produce the final customized MIS based on the specification which executes in an Internet/intranet environment.","","0-7803-4886-9","10.1109/TENCON.1998.797051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=797051","","Internet;Computer architecture;Software tools;Business communication;Computer science;Software standards;Application software;Web server;Programming;Object oriented modeling","","","1","6","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proliferation of high performance, reliable and secure internet infrastructure, along with new, rich web development tools and technologies has meant that for the first time software can be hosted in a purely web based context. Many of the traditional software packages (especially business packages) that have historically been installed and used on local computers for decades are slowly but surely appearing online. The trend is undeniable and it is now not unreasonable to speculate that most business software packages will be purely web based in the not too distant future. With this centralisation of software, comes considerable management problems. These problems stem from the astronomical scale of the data centres that operate Cloud Computing solutions. This paper suggests a new declarative language framework that might address these management problems by automating the deployment and day to day operation of cloud computing solutions.","","978-1-4244-5402-0","10.1109/DeSE.2009.16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5395121","","Cloud computing;Application software;Information technology;Software packages;Web and internet services;Computer architecture;Web server;Costs;Telecommunication computing;Packaging","","4","","14","IEEE","22 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Selenium is an open-source project for in-browser testing, originally developed by ThoughtWorks and now boasting an active community of developers and users. One of Selenium's stated goals is to become the de facto open-source replacement for proprietary tools such as WinRunner. Of particular interest to the agile community is that it offers the possibility of test-first design of Web applications, red-green signals for customer acceptance tests, and an automated regression test bed for the Web tier. This experience report describes the standard environment for testing with Selenium, as well as modifications we performed to incorporate our script pages into a wiki. It includes lessons we learned about continuous integration, script writing, and using the Selenium Recorder (renamed IDE). We also discuss how long it took to write and maintain the scripts in the iterative development environment, how close we came to covering all of the functional requirements with tests, how often the tests should be (and were) run, and whether additional automated functional testing below the GUI layer was still necessary and/or appropriate. While no silver bullet, Selenium has become a valuable addition to our agile testing toolkit, and is used on the majority of our Web application projects. It promises to become even more valuable as it gains widespread adoption and continues to be actively developed.","","0-7695-2562-8","10.1109/AGILE.2006.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1667589","","Automatic testing;Open source software;Silver;Writing;Application software;Java;Software testing;Signal design;Performance evaluation;Graphical user interfaces","","61","2","7","IEEE","14 Aug 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The World Wide Web serves as an efficient medium for administering software and hardware courses. In particular, the Web may be utilized to create a constructive dialogue between course instructor and students, that not only serves to reinforce and complement class material, but that also leads to a paperless exchange of information. From the instructor's course management standpoint, lecture notes, handouts, transparencies, project specifications, class grades, course-related links and direct access to e-mail and news group facilities for conducting online course-related discussions, can all be made available to the student via the instructor's homepage. The students, on the other hand, can make their hardware or software design reports (including project-related links) available to the instructor and other students in the class via their own homepages. This paper describes several experiences in conducting web-based paperless instructor-student dialogue in software and hardware design courses. Particular emphasis is placed on discussing: (1) the circular flow of information between instructor and student; (2) the main components of the instructor's homepage; (3) the main components of the student's homepages; (4) the effective use of course-specific newsgroups; (5) the paperless grading of course assignments; (6) privacy issues; and (7) some WWW development tools and browser plug-ins that helped in the construction of the instructor-student information exchange structure.","0190-5848","0-7803-4086-8","10.1109/FIE.1997.635985","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=635985","","Hardware;Software design;Web sites;Conducting materials;Project management;Privacy;World Wide Web","","","","","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An agro advisory system presented in this paper helps to bridge the gap between farmers and the agriculture domain experts and developed for the cotton farmers in Gujarat region of India. The system consists of three basic components; Cotton Ontology, Web Services, and Mobile Application Development. The cotton ontology maintains domain knowledge required for answering farmer queries. The ontology contains information regarding crop, soil, cultivation process, disease, pest, and other relevant information. Protégé ontology development tool is used to develop this ontology. Appropriate Web services were built which help interactions with different data sources. The RESTful Web services are programmed in Java using the JAX-RS/Jersey API and the Eclipse EE IDE. The services are developed and deployed on a cloud based application server provided by Heroku. The Web services are invoked from the mobile device and in turn they connect to various data sources like Open Weather API, SQL database and the Ontologies.

This new computing approach promises to provide many advantages, and many SMEs are encouraged to use it. However, CC is still in its early stage - for this reason we think that it is very important to study and assess its impact on SMEs' management processes. In this paper we propose a model for studying how Global Software Development can be facilitated using Cloud development environments, compared to a more traditional development environment. We use system dynamics to model and simulate how effective Cloud-based software development environments are for Global Software Development performed by a SMEs. Both studied environments assume a development process based on Scrum agile methodology. The proposed model could be used as a tool by the project managers to understand how Cloud Development Environments might facilitate Global Software Development.","2376-9505","978-0-7695-4790-9","10.1109/SEAA.2012.67","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6328190","System Dynamics;Modeling;Simulation;Cloud System;Scrum;Global Software Development","Analytical models;Planning;Computational modeling;Cloud computing;Delay;Hardware","","9","","27","IEEE","11 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The integrated development environment of an aPaaS usually provides drag-and-drop application creation and script embedding user interfaces to develop software that will be marketed and served within the same cloud. Yet, enabling application developers embed scripts or instantiate objects brings up security issues as deliberate or accidental actions may threat any cloud stakeholder during development or execution. The paper presents practical solutions to inspect tenants' software in the runtime in terms of object instantiation, method calls and CPU load generation. In the prototype implementation, object instantiation and method calls are managed to regulate access to critical file system or socket resources. Also, CPU load generated by each tenant is monitored to detect possible malicious or erroneous activity, which allows to free the CPU resources when necessary. According to the simulation results based on the prototype implementation, running the mentioned security mechanisms adds an overhead up to 20%, which is an acceptable absolute value around 2 ms, to the web applications served in the cloud in idle and normal load conditions. The mechanisms are scalable as the overhead relatively decreases with the increasing number of concurrent users.","2166-0077","978-1-4799-7470-2","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2014.7063385","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063385","PaaS;aPaaS;cloud;runtime;security","Security;Monitoring;Servers;Central Processing Unit;Software;Prototypes;Context","","4","","9","IEEE","19 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Without tool support, creating and maintaining this mental model leads to significant cognitive load because developers have to handle both relating relevant source code entities to their mental model as well as remembering already explored search paths. Furthermore, the opposite direction, that is, recalling relevant facts out of the mental model, and subsequently, seeking corresponding entities within the source code, demands similar cognitive efforts. In this paper, we introduce Code Basket, an approach for making developers' mental model visible and explorable. As for that, Code Basket helps developers keeping their mental model persistent by providing a two-dimensional canvas on which they can freely arrange visual representations of source code entities, named eggs. Since those eggs are linked to the underlying source code, eventually, they can be used for navigating directly to related source code entities. We implemented a first prototype as a touch-enabled web application that is connected to a conventional integrated development environment. In order to get early feedback on our approach, we used Code Basket within a formative study.","","978-1-4673-7037-0","10.1109/CSD.2015.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7181501","","Conferences;Context;Software","","3","","27","IEEE","13 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are many other expert system building tools providing a rich and comfortable integrated development environment to expert system builders. However, they are all either commercial or proprietary products. Jess and JessGUI are open-source freeware, and yet they are well-suited for building even complex expert system applications, both stand-alone and Web-based ones.

This leads to an impasse where improvements in programming to aid accuracy and clarity of financial software implementation such as units-of-measure analysis or typed functional programming can't be rolled out to industry. The F# programming language is increasingly used in implementing financial software and models [1]. It includes a feature called “Type Providers” to support the integration of large-scale information sources into a strongly typed functional-first programming environment. In this tutorial, we show that through the use of this simple, intuitive, scalable and on-demand mechanism called ""type providers"", we can bridge modern strongly-typed languages to the myriad of heterogeneous data services found in the modern financial programming context — for example entity graphs, databases, web services, spreadsheets and even other programming languages. We demonstrate applications using the F# language and the Xenomorph TimeScape time-series database system. • The specific F# 3.0 implementation of the type provider design has the following characteristics: • The mechanism scales to information sources containing extremely large quantities of metadata. • The mechanism can be applied to a myriad of heterogeneous data sources, including databases (SQL, vectored, time-series), web data protocols (WSDL, OData), entity graphs (Freebase), networked data markets and networked information services (World Bank). • The mechanism enables the use of code completion and interactive type checking to increase analyst efficiency when working with rich information sources. • The mechanism interacts with strongly typed tooling such as documentation assistance and completion lists and uses these as the primary way of exploring and understanding the information sources being used. • The programming experience is code focused and integrates well with strongly typed data scripting REPL environments (e.g. F# Interactive). • The programming infrastructure is neutral with regard to the protocol and data formats used. F# itself, as a language, has no specific dependency on external data sources or formats. • The mechanism uses an open architecture, so one can easily add new type providers that consume a different kind of schematized data. • The mechanism integrates technically with advanced features of type systems such as units of measure. Further, it multiplies the value of these features because of the quantity and importance of unitized data available in external in-formation sources. The tutorial will give demonstrations using the F# language. F# is a highly-productive functional-first language for correct, succcinct, robust analytical code in production environments. F# is open source and cross-platform, available under the Apache 2.0 license at http://fsharp.org. The Visual F# Tools are a supported product from Microsoft.","2380-8454","978-1-4799-2380-9","10.1109/CIFEr.2014.6924046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6924046","","Programming;Software;Computer languages;Tutorials;Databases;Protocols;Production","","","","8","IEEE","16 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Advances in these technologies have helped in improving the effectiveness of SCADA. One such development is the Internet and the World Wide Web. True to its name, it has been successful in casting a web over the wide variety of platforms and applications used in the entire information technology industry. The network thus achieved, paved a way for the common interfaces to access the data available on the net. The Internet has a strong influence on the applications and the application development environment. So, how exactly can SCADA and EMS benefit from this technological revolution ? To start with, it gives global access to the SCADA data. Today, the Internet is accessible from most corners of the world. Any off-the-shelf web browser could provide the connectivity and access to the data. This means freedom from vendor dependent hardware and software. Apart from this, it also means that different departments of a utility can also access the data without having to put in place a dedicated Intranet and other such infrastructure which calls for investments. Data security will be a matter of concern and has to be addressed. This paper talks about such issues as well as a pilot implementation.","","0-7803-4495-2","10.1109/EMPD.1998.702766","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=702766","","Internet;SCADA systems;Communications technology;Web sites;Casting;Application software;Information technology;Medical services;Hardware;Investments","","12","1","","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SSC-DASH obtains a processor definition file via Web browser and generates a HW (synthesizable Verilog-HDL description) and SWDE (Software Development Environment) for the generated processor. The SWDE includes ISS (Instruction Set Simulator), assembler, disassembler and compiler. For the verification of the defined processor, processor developers have to download the generated SWDE, every time, even where changes are small. To improve the usability of this system a Web-based interface for the generated SWDE is implemented using Ajax. Using Ajax, download of the SWDE becomes unnecessary and makes it possible to verify the processor on the server quickly and easily. This greatly improves the usability of the SWDE. In this paper, we describe implementation of Web-based ISS using Ajax.","","978-0-7695-3096-3","10.1109/WAINA.2008.285","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4483134","HW/SW codesign;C-DASH;SSC-DASH Ajax","Hardware design languages;Assembly;Process design;Java;Programming;Usability;Instruction sets;Computer architecture;Web pages;Control system synthesis","","4","","13","IEEE","3 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The driving force for this chatter is Java's simplicity and potential power. Java is programming language, and a language for the intranet and the World Wide Web (WWW). Java is a Write On one platform and Run on Many platforms (WORM) language. For network-friendly, platform-independent applications, Java (originally Oak) is an object oriented programming language. Java source code is compiled into a virtual machine code or bytecode. This makes the Java platform independent. It can be placed on a Web site, and executed on the client side on a PC-Intel, Mac, Motorola or UNIX-Solaris machine without recompiling. Sun Microsystems formally announced Java in May 1995. Java is the first language that has built-in capabilities for networking applications, in particular, creating dynamic Web pages. Java programs that run on the Internet Web pages are called applets. These applets are easily incorporated into Web pages. These applets are executed from homepages on remote Web sites. Java programs run interpretively on the client side. Java reduces development costs and speeds up the learning curve. Traditional client server development tools-such as Delphi, Power-Builder and Visual Basic-are losing ground to Java as a result. By the year-end of 1996, Java had moved ahead in use of both C and C++ and these application development tools.","1558-1772","","10.1109/45.714612","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=714612","","Java;Web pages;Computer languages;Web sites;World Wide Web;Object oriented programming;Virtual machining;Sun;Internet;Costs","","1","1","8","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This paper will review a novel approach for implementing a secure hybrid cloud. Specifically, public and private cloud entities will be discussed for a hybrid cloud approach. The approach is based on extension of virtual Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Layer 2 switching functions from a private cloud and to public clouds, tunneled on an OSI Layer 3 connection. As a result of this hybrid cloud approach, virtual workloads can be migrated from the private cloud to the public cloud and continue to be part of the same Layer 2 domain as in the private cloud, thereby maintaining consistent operational paradigms in bot the public and private cloud. This paper will introduce and discuss the virtual switching technologies which are fundamental underpinnings of the secure hybrid approach. This paper will not only discuss the virtual Layer 2 technical architecture of this approach, but also related security components. Specifically, data in motion security between the public and private clouds and interworkload secure communication in the public cloud will be reviewed. As part of the hybrid cloud approach, security aspects like encrypted communication tunnels, key management, and security management will be discussed. Moreover, management consoles, control points, and integration with cloud orchestration systems will also be discussed. Additionally, hybrid cloud consideration for network services like network firewall, server load balancers, application accelerators, and network routing functions will be examined.

In this paper, using an information foraging theory lens, we qualitatively study the debugging behaviors of 16 web-active end users. Our results show that the stronger scents available within mashup programming environments can improve users' foraging success.

The three predominant service models are infrastructure, platform, and software-asa-service. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) can be defined as the use of servers, storage, and virtualization to enable utility like services for users. Security is a big concern within IaaS, especially considering that the rest of the cloud service models run on top of the infrastructure and related layers. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) providers offer access to APIs, programming languages and development middleware which allows subscribers to develop custom applications without installing or configuring the development environment. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) gives subscribed or pay-peruse users access to software or services which reside in the cloud and not on the user's device. Understanding the cloud service models is critical in determining if cloud services or hosting are an appropriate business solution, and if so, which model best balances the level of control required versus reduced hardware, configuration, and maintenance costs. Cloud computing offers many benefits to organizations; it has enabled collaboration amongst disparate communities and workgroups, and has overcome challenges that have plagued existing business solutions. However, the security, privacy, and integrity of the cloud are of prime importance and there are many challenges that exist. At the present time there seems to be a lot of momentum behind the adoption of cloud computing despite these. This may simply be a trend, an indication that society truly wants their data to be available whenever from anywhere, or a sign that few understand the associated risks.","","978-1-4673-4794-5","10.1109/CASoN.2012.6412402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6412402","clouds;cloud computing;cloud layers;infrastructure as a service;IaaS;platform as a service;PaaS;software as a service;SaaS;service oriented;security;privacy;cloud challenges;cloud benefits","Security;Cloud computing;Software as a service;Computational modeling;Hardware;Educational institutions","","46","","52","IEEE","17 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most existing Web-based educational programming environments, often designed for a single programming language, offer little room for customization. Our research group has developed a Web-based application framework for educational programming environments called Wappen. Wappen-based applications can be adapted for a variety of programming languages and support extensive customization by teachers via the Eclipse RCP (Rich Client Platform). However, Wappen-based applications have some deficiencies. In particular, they can be slow to start up because of their large size, and it is difficult for teachers to tailor user interfaces written using the SWT (Standard Widget Toolkit). WappenLite is more lightweight and can offer a richer user interface because it allows teachers to use HTML and Flash as the platform for writing user interfaces. This paper describes a Flash-based user interface that is designed for novice learners and implemented as a WappenLite-based application.","","978-1-4244-5704-5","10.1109/ICINFA.2010.5512458","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5512458","Web;Programming;RCP;Flash","User interfaces;Programming environments;Computer languages;Java;Program processors;Programming profession;Application software;Automation;Joining processes;Libraries","","2","","10","IEEE","19 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, standard data mining platforms, such as Weka and Orange, involve only their own data mining algorithms in the process of knowledge discovery from local data sources. In contrast, next generation data mining technologies should enable processing of distributed data sources, the use of data mining algorithms implemented as web services, as well as the use of formal descriptions of data sources and knowledge discovery tools in the form of ontologies, enabling automated composition of complex knowledge discovery workflows for a given data mining task. This paper proposes a novel Service-oriented Knowledge Discovery framework and its implementation in a service-oriented data mining environment Orange4WS (Orange for Web Services), based on the existing Orange data mining toolbox and its visual programming environment, which enables manual composition of data mining workflows. The new service-oriented data mining environment Orange4WS includes the following new features: simple use of web services as remote components that can be included into a data mining workflow; simple incorporation of relational data mining algorithms; a knowledge discovery ontology to describe workflow components (data, knowledge and data mining services) in an abstract and machine-interpretable way, and its use by a planner that enables automated composition of data mining workflows.

We describe an approach to end user programming called tactile programming which extends visual techniques with a unified program manipulation paradigm that makes programs easy to comprehend, compose and, most importantly, share over the World Wide Web. Tactile programming's inherent ability to support the social context in which programming takes place along with its ability to ease program comprehension and composition is what differentiates this approach from others.

Although the technology is well specified and supported by the programming tools, it is still not widely used. Some of the main reasons are the difficulties which the end users have in searching an adequate web service to get the required data. Even if found, the web service rarely fit the exact needs. This paper presents a new framework for dynamical generation of the web services from the heterogeneous data sources on user's demand. The aim of the framework is to generate web services that are customized to the particular requirements. Apart from specifying the requirements in WSDL, the framework proposes the ontology for describing the available data.","","953-6114-90-9","10.1109/SOFTCOM.2006.329763","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4129917","","Web services;Ontologies;Publishing;Distributed computing;XML;Service oriented architecture;Semantic Web;Runtime;Middleware;Distributed power generation","","1","","8","","19 Mar 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Internet/Web systems development: what can be learned from hi-tech new product strategic planning","G. Scott","University of Connecticut, USA","36th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2003. Proceedings of the","6 Feb 2003","2003","","","7 pp.","","A DELPHI questionnaire study of the management problems of Internet/Web systems development was completed in 2001 and its results have been reported in the literature. The most important problems collectively consist of a cluster of problems involving Internet strategic planning and other strategy-related problems. This cluster includes 4 of the first 5 problems and a total of 7 of the top 16. Other recent research studies have reached similar conclusions about the high importance of strategy considerations in the field of high-tech product development, where strategic planning for new product development was found to be the top problem. High-tech product development occurs in a different operating (and usually mutually exclusive) environment from that of Internet/Web systems (Web systems) development in that the former involves R&D, engineering, and production activities and produces a (usually) physical product suited for the marketplace, whereas Web systems development creates systems for internal use by the developing company, using analysis and development tools and methodologies that differ significantly from those of traditional IT systems development. However, the new-product development activities and Web systems development activities also have a great deal in common: each takes place in a highly uncertain, rapidly changing, complex, advanced-technology environment that is difficult for other managers to understand and properly consider during the strategy planning processes. A large body of knowledge has emerged about strategic planning and management of new-product development, but no such body of knowledge has yet emerged with respect to Web systems development strategic planning activities. This article is directed to strategic planning management knowledge transfer from the high-tech product development arena to the field of Web systems development. The article first describes, and then compares the processes of both activities. Then considered is how high-tech product development planning and management practices can be used for Web systems development.","","0-7695-1874-5","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174764","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174764","","Internet;Strategic planning;Product development;Technology management;Research and development;Knowledge management;Technology planning;Production systems;Environmental management;Process planning","","","","15","IEEE","6 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"New Flash player rises in the Web-video market","J.

Now, though, the Big Three players face a challenger that initially became well-known for uses that had nothing to do with video: Adobe (formerly Macromedia) Flash. Even before Adobe's $3.4 billion buyout of Macromedia, Flash - once just a Web site animation tool $was expanding into online video. Now that Flash has access to Adobe's clout and resources, as well as new technology, proponents hope this process will accelerate. However, Flash is considerably smaller than its competitors and offers faster download speeds. It is also tightly integrated with the well-regarded Flash multimedia-development environment. Nonetheless, Flash's strengths are already making the technology a prominent part of the online-video landscape, a process that could continue if Adobe keeps improving it. The new Flash 8 environment, released in August 2005, includes Flash Player 8 and Flash Professional 8, a set of content-creation tools. According to analysts, Flash is likely to become increasingly successful in the on-demand streaming segment of the video-player market but probably won't expand into other areas unless major features are added.","1558-0814","","10.1109/MC.2006.66","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1597078","Flash 8;web-video;video players","Streaming media;Portable media players;Internet;Hardware;Software tools;Linux;Computer industry;Market research;Video codecs;Sparks","","13","","","IEEE","21 Feb 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The emerging real-time web is based on web feeds-streams of real-time information usually implemented using RSS/Atom protocols. Since real-time content is torrential, web users who follow a large number of web feeds usually overwhelm their feed-readers with content they are not able to handle in a reasonable time. The goal of the Erl-metafeed is to provide a platform for scalable management of web feeds in near real-time. The prototype is implemented in Erlang programming language because of its concurrency support and soft real-time execution. Erl-metafeed is programmable using custom query language available via web interface. Additionally, since textual query language is not suitable for end-users, we designed and implemented set of web widgets on top of the Geppeto programming environment. Geppeto environment enables intuitive composition of widgets into powerful mashups, thus circumventing need for learning query language.","","978-1-4673-2232-4","10.1109/EUROCON.2013.6624959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6624959","mashup;widgets;web feeds;RSS;real-time web","Feeds;Mashups;Real-time systems;Database languages;Servers;Databases","","","","21","IEEE","10 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Developers can concentrate on writing applications because they can skip traditional construction of the development environment. GAE supports Python, Java, Go and PHP. Python and Java are in common use. Go is considered as a promising language because it is designed for ease of programming, and has modern features such as a garbage-collector and built-in support for concurrency. Employing this approach, we developed the system in a short span of time because server or database management are not necessary. System development on the cloud environment is still not common compared to traditional way, but this technology has many advantages, crucial for modern IT business.","2325-5994","978-1-4673-7658-7","10.1109/ICAwST.2015.7314020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7314020","Cloud Computing;Web Development;Google App Engine;Go Programming Language","Schedules;Java;Google;Databases;Cloud computing;Engines","","1","","10","IEEE","2 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present an empirical cost/benefit analysis of two different categories of automated functional web testing approaches: (1) capture-replay web testing (in particular, using Selenium IDE); and, (2) programmable web testing (using Selenium WebDriver). On a set of six web applications, we evaluated the costs of applying these testing approaches both when developing the initial test suites from scratch and when the test suites are maintained, upon the release of a new software version. Results indicate that, on the one hand, the development of the test suites is more expensive in terms of time required (between 32% and 112%) when the programmable web testing approach is adopted, but on the other hand, test suite maintenance is less expensive when this approach is used (with a saving between 16% and 51%). We found that, in the majority of the cases, after a small number of releases (from one to three), the cumulative cost of programmable web testing becomes lower than the cost involved with capture-replay web testing and the cost saving gets amplified over the successive releases.","2375-5369","978-1-4799-2931-3","10.1109/WCRE.2013.6671302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6671302","Test Case Evolution;Test Case Repair;Empirical Study;Selenium IDE;Selenium WebDriver","Testing;Software;Web pages;Maintenance engineering;Programming;Computer languages;Browsers","","65","1","16","IEEE","21 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Whatever the case, this compute intensive process, quite often, has a non-interactive, non-Web-based interface and without instant visualization. While grid generator can be used to generate grid geometry art, any 2D image editing program can also be deployed, nevertheless, the result is a static display of a pixel- or vector-based image. This paper describes an interactive Web-based visualization as a fundamental medium for visualization, one that changes the way grid geometry art are being visualized, developed, generated and delivered. The author first provides relevant background of grid geometry art, discusses several existing methodologies and their inadequacy currently used within the Web environments. She offers a new paradigm -- a Web-based interactive development tool that integrates an interface for exploration, structuring and dissemination of visualization results for grid geometry art. Such is an instant conceptualization and artistic interpretation of an image as an arrangement of an uniform m x n grid of colored cells: quadrilaterals formed within a set of finite orthogonal grids. The parameter-driven algorithm with minimal user setup for ""automatic"" idea generation provides the tools for constructing De Stijl, Abstraction Geometry -- Concentric Squares geometrical objects from numerical arrays not only makes and manipulates, it distributes geometric shapes over planes, as well as performs color and rectangular shape transformations. The author briefly discusses the tool, demonstrates and renders specific examples of the art thus created as she illustrates the advantages of using a single tool to embrace the structuring and delivery of a garden variety of grid geometry art.","2375-0138","0-7695-2602-0","10.1109/IV.2006.66","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1648331","orthogonal grids;grid geometry art;interactive Web-based;visualization;2D geometry tools;scalable pixel-free images;mathematics and art","Art;Information geometry;Visualization","","2","","14","IEEE","24 Jul 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose an architecture for smart programming playgrounds that can facilitate rapid prototyping of incomplete code snippets through a semi-automatic context resolution that involves identifying static dependencies, provisioning external resources on the cloud and injecting resource bindings to handles in the original code fragment. Such a system could be potentially useful in a range of different scenarios, from sharing code snippets on the Web to experimenting with new ideas during traditional software development.","1558-1225","978-1-4799-1934-5","10.1109/ICSE.2015.204","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7203024","playgrounds;code snippets;dependency injection;cloud computing","Context;Databases;Programming;IEEE catalogs;Libraries;Graphical user interfaces;Engines","","","","12","IEEE","17 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The evolution of Cloud Computing motivates teaching Cloud Computing to computer science senior students and graduate students so that they can gain broad exposure to the main body of knowledge of Cloud Computing and get prepared for occupations in industry. There is thus a strong need for having a Cloud Computing education course that (i) has a broad coverage of different roles interacting with a cloud; and (ii) leverages Cloud Computing concepts, technology and architecture topics at both introductory and advanced level. In this paper, we describe the demand for understanding the impact of Cloud Computing in computer science higher education. We propose education strategies for teaching Cloud Computing, including key knowledge areas for an enduring Cloud Computing course.","2377-570X","978-1-4799-4970-0","10.1109/CSEET.2014.6816778","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816778","","Cloud computing;Education;Computer architecture;Computational modeling;Business;Architecture","","17","","35","IEEE","19 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the evolution of Web-based applications presents special challenges that have not been well addressed by existing SCM systems. They often treat hyperlinked Web documents as a set of text files in a file .system and disregard crucial structures in a Web-based application such as internal structure, navigational structure, logical structure, and compositional structure among Web objects. Key limitations include their inadequacy to represent Web object semantics and their inability to manage changes to those important structures among objects making up a Web application. This paper presents a novel SCM-centered development environment for Web-based applications, named WebSCM. With WebSCM, Web developers can manage fine-grained, structural evolution of Web objects and important structures among them at different levels of abstraction (e.g. conceptual, navigational, presentation, and implementation levels). This paper also describes the motivation for this environment as well as its user interfaces, features, and implementation.","1063-6773","0-7695-2368-4","10.1109/ICSM.2005.62","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1510152","","Application software;Navigation;Software engineering;Engineering management;HTML;Technology management;XML;Computer science;Software tools;Software systems","","","","26","IEEE","21 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The new tool accounts with the non autonomous nature of the IOPT Petri net class, where transition firing is constrained by external input events and input signals (expressed in transition guards); on the other hand, transitions can trigger the occurrence of output signal events and place marking can activate output signals. To achieve the performance level necessary for the fast generation of complex state-spaces during reasonable time, the tool employs a compilation strategy, starting with the automatic creation of an optimized C program. When executed, the program will create an hierarchical XML file containing the state-space graph. The output XML file can subsequently be used for model checking and property analysis, applying standard XML query languages. Finally, the output file can be converted to SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), enabling the graphical visualization of small to medium size state-space graphs. The new tool was implemented using a set of XSL transformations and can be used as a standalone tool or as a building block in higher level frameworks, with easy integration in Web applications and graphical integrated development environments.","2378-363X","978-1-4577-0434-5","10.1109/INDIN.2011.6034907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6034907","","XML;Generators;Unified modeling language;Elevators;Analytical models;System recovery;Semantics","","10","","25","IEEE","6 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The EP voltage measurements were acquired at discrete locations on the endocardial surface by a catheter-based electroanatomic mapping system as part of left ventricular tachycardia ablation procedures. These data were output as a list of voltages and 3-D mapping system coordinates. PET/SPECT data were 3-D short axis perfusion or viability images and derived polar maps. CardioViewer allows GUI menu-driven data input and display of EP and PET/SPECT data as well as their fusion in orthogonal slice, point cloud and polar map views. The software development environment was C++ using Qt Creator IDE, Open GL, ITK, freeglut and dicomlib. The modular program architecture facilitated addition of new functionalities and CardioViewer has been successfully run on Linux, Windows and Apple operating systems. Initial registration of EP and PET/SPECT datasets was achieved with user-input control points, after which the six degrees of freedom registration parameters could be interactively adjusted. EP voltage and PET/SPECT values can be output at matched polar map locations, which avoids regional averaging of tissue properties. CardioViewer is being used to investigate local prediction of EP tissue categories from PET/SPECT images.

In the initial stage of desktop CAI development, we obtained valuable insight into ways to improve the animated simulations through informal student feedback and ongoing formative evaluation. We note that presentation time in both lecture and lab are significantly reduced by applying these modules. The second stage of desktop CAI evaluation began after most of the suggestions from the initial stage had been incorporated. The evaluation of the desktop CAI in the second stage consists of a more direct measurement comparing pre-test and post-test scores for students conducting lab exercises in either the traditional hands-on assignment or in the CAI/CAS format. This study also shows no statistical difference between the two groups of students. However, this review demonstrates the importance of student feedback in both formative and summative evaluations and several key benefits of the CAI/CAS format. Lastly, this paper presents our development strategy for enhancing these materials and for converting them into a web-based format.

However, despite the successful initiatives of integrating many of the latter in current IDEs (e.g., Eclipse), code smells detection has not gained the same status. Researchers have pointed out that the code smells detection process is inherently subjective and this fact is probably the main hindrance on providing automatic support. This research work focuses on the code smells detection process. To this end, it aims at proposing two contributions that, when used in a combined fashion, are expected to mitigate the aforementioned problem: crowdsmellling and smelly maps. We envisage that such features will be available in a future generation of interactive development environments (aka IDE 2.0) to help software developers to identify a set of code smells in Java source code. Crowdsmelling uses the concept of collective intelligence through which users around the world are encouraged to collaborate to a knowledge base that runs on a cloud server. This process will improve the assessment of the detection accuracy using a calibration process that occurs on the server after receiving data and suggestions from each user. Through the process of code smells detection based and referenced to a knowledge base (one for each code smell), we expect to some extent mitigate the subjectivity problem. Smelly maps builds upon the previous experience of setting up a software visualization infrastructure. It involves a strategy to represent detected code smells at different abstraction levels with the goal to increase software quality awareness. We expect to integrate both proposals with the aforementioned visualization infrastructure developed as an Eclipse plugin to facilitate refactoring decisions upon large software systems. We have laid out several evidence-based validation experiments, which will hopefully demonstrate that a step forward in the code smelling process will be achieved.","","978-1-4799-6133-7","10.1109/QUATIC.2014.49","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6984139","Software Quality (Software Quality Improvement);Software Construction (Software Construction Tools);Software Maintenance (Reengineering);Code Smell Detection (Code Smell Detection Tools)","Software;Calibration;Context;Visualization;Java;Servers","","3","1","29","IEEE","15 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cocoa is a programming environment that enables children to create their own simulations and games. They can then share their creations by adding them to web pages. Cocoa is distributed from a World Wide Web site, and that site serves as a community center for Cocoa users. Cocoa was designed over several years, involving users from the very start. The experience of designing an intevace that was powerful enough to enable users to create interesting programs, yet simple enough for children, has brought out some interesting examples of inteqace principles, as well as practical considerations that run counter to established principles. The intevace that resulted from this design process combines graphical rules with programming by demonstration. This system has led to notable classroom success in engaging children in the programming process, and in empowering them to create their own interactive worlds and simulations. It is considerably more challenging to motivate, encourage, and teach children who download the program from a web site. The Cocoa site offers a variety of methods for children to communicate with each other, and to learn how to use Cocoa. The author will discuss his experiences in designing Cocoa and supporting the distributed community of Cocoa users.","","0-8186-7525-X","10.1109/OZCHI.1996.559979","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=559979","","USA Councils;Programming environments;Computational modeling;Web pages;Web sites;Counting circuits;Process design","","","","","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The game developer ends up writing everything from the raw backend server to persist the game state to the end-user game features. Furthermore, the game developer needs to come up with several custom implementations to consume different providers to do things like user player login, game storage, social interaction, analytics, etc. This paper aims to present a practical solution that covers the gap between raw cloud services (the tool) and the high level functionality (the real-life game features) a game needs to be successfully built in less time (and at a lower cost) than the current solutions take.","2166-675X","978-1-4799-1245-2","10.1109/IGIC.2013.6659145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6659145","html5;cloud services;game features;player identification;game data manipulation;context sensing","Games;Lead;Libraries;Buildings;Clouds;Context;Sensors","","","","5","IEEE","11 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main focus of feature identification research to date is in a reverse engineering context. Despite the fact that research has highlighted the usefulness of feature identification techniques for program comprehension, very little of this effort has found its way into the software engineer's development environment. In this paper, we demonstrate a tool providing a perspective of a system that reflects how features are implemented to support maintenance activities. By integrating this tool in a development environment we support feature understanding while performing maintenance activities. This environment, called feature-centric environment, compares several features visually, provides a detailed view for a single feature and integrates a code browser focusing on a single feature of a software system. All these different views are enriched with metrics, they are interconnected and the user is able to interact with them.

As these tools evolved, they scaled-up by exploiting more powerful development machines. The same tools were adapted for team development to run on small, project-specific clusters by dedicating a server to process a single job at a time. While this paradigm has served us well in the past, it fails to take advantage of the positive network effects of cloud-based computing. During the past year, our team constructed a cloud based build system that enables fast and efficient builds through techniques that leverage parallel, cached, incremental, distributed, and multitenant builds. Leveraging the cloud's compute elasticity and storage capacity enabled us to reduce builds latency dramatically, building today in seconds and minutes instead of hours. But migrating existing tools to the cloud is daunting. This paper summarizes our findings in the form of six principles, on how we need to evolve engineering tools, starting with those that participate in the build automation, to simplify, take control, and move these tools to the cloud.","1558-0814","","10.1109/MC.2013.337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6617629","software engineering tools;build systems;cloud computing;simplicity in IT","Software development;Software maintenance;Cloud computing;Control systems","","7","","6","IEEE","2 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

First, the dynamics of a steer-by-wire EPS system and a six-phase PMSM drive system are described in detail. Moreover, the WFNN-AMF controller, which combines the advantages of wavelet decomposition, fuzzy logic system, and asymmetric membership function (AMF), is developed to achieve the required control performance of the EPS system for the improvement of stability of the vehicle and the comfort of the driver. Furthermore, the online learning algorithm of WFNN-AMF is derived using back-propagation method. However, degenerated or diverged responses will be resulted due to the inappropriate selection of small or large learning rates of the WFNN-AMF. Therefore, an IDE algorithm is proposed to online adapt the learning rates of WFNN-AMF. In addition, a 32-bit floating-point digital signal processor, TMS320F28335, is adopted for the implementation of the proposed intelligent controlled EPS system.

So our e-commerce industry's development prospects will be broader. Under the e-commerce environment, the competition towards online sellers has become more and more diverse and dynamic than the traditional competition game model. The rapid development of e-commerce makes more and more companies begin to get involved in this area, the market competition has become much fiercer. The vast majority of sellers on e-commerce platform can be viewed as a small business organization, and those businesses who sell similar products is single point of competition and multi-point competition. The sales strategies and mutual games towards the sellers also become increasingly fierce. At present, the game theory are basically involved in the one-dimensional game, few scholars have presented and applied multidimensional game in products pricing strategy; and few scholars have studied a little about one-dimensional game under the e-commerce environment, which mainly focused on the supply and demand sides 'complete information game. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce multidimensional game to study the game towards multi-sellers under the e-commerce environment, and find the game mechanism towards online sellers, so as to provide references for the optimization of e-commerce environment. On the basis of the analysis of the e-commerce industry's development environment, we make a summary analysis of the competition and game studies which related to the online sellers. At the same time, we analyze the online sellers' strategy studies of opening online shops and marketing from home and abroad. Faced with the complex and variable market's demands, the games towards online sellers have become more flexible. From the multidimensional game theory, we set the game strategic conditions of online sellers who sell homogeneous products. In view of the e-commerce environment, how do those online sellers choose the advertising inputs, related transaction service inputs and commodities pricing strategies in order to maximize their profits, we establish a multi-seller's multidimensional game model under the e-commerce environment and solve the equilibrium condition. Then we make a primary analysis of the equilibrium results and find the existence of online sellers' optimal game strategy equilibrium under the e-commerce environment. This research has certain guidance significance for the optimization of the sellers' game and their competition behaviors under the e-commerce environment.","","978-1-4799-1891-1","10.1109/LISS.2015.7369666","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7369666","e-commerce;online sellers;multidimensional game","Games;Pricing;Electronic commerce;Industries;Companies;Analytical models","","","","24","IEEE","4 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Developing XML Web services with WebSphere Studio Application Developer","C. Lau; A. Ryman","Toronto Laboratory, Markham, ONT, Canada; Toronto Laboratory, Markham, ONT, Canada",IBM Systems Journal,"6 Apr 2010","2002","41","2","178","197","Web services have recently emerged as a powerful technology for integrating heterogeneous applications over the Internet. The widespread adoption of Web services promises to usher in an exciting new generation of advanced distributed applications. These will support a new and growing set of specifications, such as Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), Web Services Description Language (WSDL), and Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI). Extensible Markup Language (XML) and its associated family of standards also play a central role in Web services by providing a data interchange format that is independent of both programming languages and operating systems. The application developer seeking to reap the benefits of Web services is therefore faced with a significant, and potentially steep, new learning curve. Clearly, application development tools that lower this barrier are crucial for the rapid and widespread adoption of Web services. This paper discusses the development tasks associated with XML Web services and describes a new suite of tools that improve developer productivity, by reducing the requirements for detailed knowledge of the underlying specifications and standards, and allow the developer to focus on the business problem domain. This suite of XML and Web services tools is part of IBM's recently released WebSphere® Studio Application Developer product, which is based on the new Eclipse open source tool integration platform.","0018-8670","","10.1147/sj.412.0178","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5386921","","","","12","6","","","6 Apr 2010","","","IBM","IBM Journals"

O'Reilly","Fisheries and Marine Institute of Memorial University, St. John's, NL, Canada; Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Moss Landing, CA, USA; Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Moss Landing, CA, USA",OCEANS 2009,"1 Mar 2010","2009","","","1","6","As we continue to expand our activities on and beneath the surface of our oceans, there is an ever-expanding requirement to monitor and collect oce?anographie and meteorological data in increasingly remote and harsh marine environments. Ocean Observing systems provide critical information; information in support of problem solving, decision making, prediction and forecasting as well as in support of offshore engineering and design activities. In short, these systems enable us to better understand the oceans around us. Ocean data are often expensive and logistically challenging to collect. It is crucial that maximum value is derived from the investment made in ocean observation. Collecting and delivering data in a cost effective and timely manner is essential to its viability and ultimately its value to the end user. Over the last two decades there has been an explosion in the use of GIS (Geographic Information Systems) in ocean observation across a wide range of sectors from aquaculture to defense and security. As acceptance and usage of GIS continues to grow in these disparate sectors, many applications have developed their own data standards and their own proprietary software for processing, analysis and presentation. The concept of Open GIS was conceived with the vision of creating a set of open interface standards to enable diverse geo-processing systems to share data and communicate directly and efficiently. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) was formed to develop these open interface specifications as well as to lead the education and outreach components of the initiative. In broadest terms, an ocean observing system is comprised of three primary functional layers. The ""top"" layer, from the point of view of the end user, is the application layer, the software tools that enable the user to process, interpret and act upon data. The second layer is the service layer, the hardware and software necessary to move, store and manage data. The third layer is the data collection layer consisting of the sensors and systems that are the physical interface with the ocean environment. The OGC promotes the concept of Sensor Web Enablement. A Sensor Web is a World Wide Web accessible network comprised of geographically distributed sensors and archived data. The sensors may monitor any physical parameter depending on the location and the application. The data, whether directly from sensors or from archived sources, can be located and accessed using standard communications protocols and programming tools. Fully implemented, OGC specifications will ultimately enable access to geospatial data regardless of source or location. It will enable data from different sources to be integrated and analyzed and will promote ""common look and feel"" visualization and display of information. There is considerable interest in the marine user community to define a new class of standards-based ocean sensors. These sensors can be located and identified over the World Wide Web, demonstrate ""plug and work"" interoperability in the field and offer data that can be shared, processed and presented to end users across many disciplines and applications. Ultimately these ""smart"" ocean sensors will result in new and increased market potential for sensor manufacturers as well as reduced costs to the end user. The Smart Ocean Sensors Consortium (SOSC) has been formed by a group of ocean sensor manufacturers and end users with the collective vision of improving the reliability, utility and cost-effectiveness of ocean observing sensor networks through the adoption, development, and promotion of appropriate standard interfaces and protocols. A primary SOSC objective is the submission of an interoperable ocean sensor specification for adoption by the Open Geospatial Consortium and ultimately dissemination to the wider oceans community.","0197-7385","978-1-4244-4960-6","10.23919/OCEANS.2009.5422448","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5422448","","Oceans;Intelligent sensors;Geographic Information Systems;Costs;Application software;Standards development;Communication standards;Web sites;Manufacturing;Sea surface","","10","","4","","1 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

End-user driven development poses new requirements on the development tools, which traditionally are targeted for software developers.

The reason is that the Web services often work as front-ends to enterprise systems and are used in a session-oriented way by the clients. Contrary to the case of stateless services, for a stateful Web service there exist constraints to the order in which the operations of the service may be invoked. However, specification of such constraints is not a standard part of a Web service interface, and compliance with such constraints is not checked by the standard Web service development tools. Therefore, we propose in this paper to extend a web service interface by a constraint definition that is based on behavior protocols. Also, we implemented a tool that checks whether a given BPEL code complies with the constraints of all stateful web services it communicates with. The key idea behind the tool is to translate the BPEL code into Java and then to check the Java program using Java PathFinder with behavior protocol extension.","2376-9505","978-0-7695-3276-9","10.1109/SEAA.2008.11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725699","web services;BPEL;session-oriented interactions;behavior protocols;model checking","Web services;Java;Software engineering;Simple object access protocol;Standards development;XML;Application software;Mathematics;Physics;Computer science","","1","1","19","IEEE","22 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

IOPT nets are a Petri net class specifically designed to support the implementation of embedded system controllers. The IOPT-Tools Web service (http://gres.uninova.pt) includes an interactive graphical editor to design IOPT models, a model-checking framework consisting of a state-space generator and a query system, and automatic code generation tools to produce software (C) or hardware (VHDL) controller implementations. The Brushless DC Motor speed controller was decomposed into several subsystems, including a noise-filter, quadrature-decoder, PWM generator and an BLDC commutation-manager. These sub-systems were modeled using simple IOPT models, analyzed using the model-checking tools, resulting in the automatic creation of VHDL modules for each sub-system. To finish the entire project, a top VHDL module is used to instantiate copies of the automatically generated components and specify signals to connect the components to the external world. With the addition of an inverter board, a working prototype was implemented and successfully tested.","","978-1-4673-4569-9","10.1109/ICIT.2013.6505810","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6505810","","Pulse width modulation;Commutation;Field programmable gate arrays;Radiation detectors;Inverters;Synchronization;Brushless DC motors","","5","","12","IEEE","22 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present the Easy SOC project, a catalog of guidelines to build service-oriented applications and services. This catalog synthesizes best SOC development practices that arise as a result of several years of research in fundamental SOC-related topics, namely WSDL-based technical specification, Web Service discovery and Web Service outsourcing. In addition, we describe a plug-in for the Eclipse IDE that has been implemented to simplify the utilization of the guidelines.

The leading consoles each possess their own bespoke platform to digitally deploy game applications to their users via the Internet, whilst the Windows and Mac OS X gaming market is catered for by systems such as Valve’s Steam platform. However, these digital content services are often machine-specific, proprietary systems, utilising custom web frameworks and a rigid publication system. In this paper we present an overview of the Homura games framework and +et Homura deployment middleware. Homura provides an integrated solution for Java based 3D games development. We also discuss a novel architecture and prototype system, which aims to unify the deployment of hardware accelerated Java-based 3D games applications with online capabilities. +et Homura provides a multi-tiered deployment platform that is secure, robust, and easily portable to a wide range of web servers; whilst the networking middleware component of +et Homura allows developers to build content and feature rich online games in conjunction with the Homura Engine and IDE. Due to nature of the technologies used within the +et Homura framework, it is possible to enable the creation of a game which, from development through to hosting, deployment and networking, can be created with little or no financial outlay for the developer by utilising open source technologies.","","978-1-4244-8044-9","10.1109/DeSE.2010.32","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5633688","Homura;Net Homura;Java;jME;Java Web Start;Applets;Deployment;Digital Distribution;Game Engine;Web Games","Games;Java;Rendering (computer graphics);Libraries;Three dimensional displays;Browsers;Physics","","5","","","IEEE","11 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These tasks may execute on machines ranging from their local workstations to high-end, grid-enabled compute resources. Often, these tasks are legacy applications written in various programming and scripting languages and are designed to be run in a single user environment rather than as a Web application. These tasks often need to be tied together into composite applications that need to span multiple computing resources. The majority of the scientific experiments in E-Science involve orchestrating multiple tasks in the correct fashion to produce scientific computational experiments. Scientific workflows have proven to be a coherent and abstract framework that is capable of capturing such scientific experiments and hence have gained popularity among the scientific community. Many of the current E-Science projects have adopted different workflow systems and consequently have adopted custom workflow execution and description standards. We argue that the core of the execution semantics used by most scientific workflows can be expressed as a small common set, and we further investigate the possibility of having a higher level workflow description language that is capable of capturing and possibly bridging these different workflow systems. In this demonstration we present a set of E-Science development tools for managing these problems: a high level workflow composition monitoring and enactment tool, a toolkit that is capable of providing Web service interfaces for command line scientific applications, and a service registry that is used as a repository for sharing. This domain independent workflow suite will allow users from wide verity of environments to selectively and securely share their applications as Web services and construct workflows with these services. The suite also features on-demand service creation, workflow orchestration and monitoring. Furthermore, these components can be used individually or collectively to build a small to large-scale E-Science infrastructures.","","978-1-4244-3380-3","10.1109/eScience.2008.149","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4736781","E-Science;Scientific Workflow;Application Wrapper;Grid;BPEL;OGCE","Grid computing;Application software;Web services;Monitoring;Graphical user interfaces;Engines;Flow graphs;Java;Workstations;Large-scale systems","","1","","7","IEEE","6 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Users may often need to use not only a single service, but also several services, and in some cases, use those services in combination with their own local applications. Users need a simple and interactive tool for service composition development to realize their needs without writing any program codes, and to reduce realization time. In our previous work, we proposed the software architecture for ad hoc service federation of Web and local resources. This architecture enables users to directly manipulate visual components, and to create new composite components for the creation of services that use Web applications, Web services, and local applications. In this architecture, every service composition is done by users' manipulation. In this paper, we will propose a new software architecture, called a PadLogSpace, for extending the service registration function and the service matching function of our previously proposed PadSpace to provide a semantic rule-definition mechanism for the service composition development.","","978-1-84919-208-8","10.1049/cp.2010.0593","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5632235","","","","","","","","11 Nov 2010","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Resources can now be acquired on-demand in a flexible, scalable and rapid way. However, cloud providers lack of native mechanisms to guarantee the Quality of Service required by specific application domains. High availability can be achieved by replication of critical components. Since outages could affect the entire cloud provider, replication can be effective only by using multiple providers. In this paper we tackle the above problem and present an approach to guarantee availability requirements of cloud-based applications by exploiting replication on multiple clouds to reduce unavailability, still limiting costs. More precisely, we propose: i) an approach to model, at design time, the application, its availability requirements and the characteristics of the used clouds, and ii) a self-adaptive technique responsible, at runtime, of both in-cloud scaling policies and traffic routing among different cloud providers, by means of a control-theoretical approach. We integrated the modeling approach in the Palladio Bench IDE and developed a runtime self-adaptation controller in Matlab. The controller has been evaluated against different workload conditions, costs variations and service failures in simulated scenarios. The controller has been able to provide the desired availability minimizing costs.","2156-7891","978-1-4673-6447-8","10.1109/MiSE.2013.6595294","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6595294","Cloud computing;multi-cloud applications;availability;control theory;non-functional requirements;self-adaptive software","Availability;Throughput;Monitoring;Load modeling;Equations;Mathematical model;Computational modeling","","19","","17","IEEE","12 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While security testing tools and static analyzers exist for security professionals, similar tools to be used by software engineers who are normally non security experts are missing. This automated tool support is non-intrusive during implementation by being fully integrated in the IDE developers use, efficient to not slow down the overall implementation effort, and extensible to consider different vulnerabilities. We implement this IDE integration as an extension to SAP HANA Web-based Development Workbench.

A major problem in this subject is the lack of specialized 3D graphics libraries for Internet, with similar functionalities to those of OpenGL for standalone applications. Although several APIs (Java3D, GJ4JAVA, JOGL, LWJGL, jGL) have been proposed to tackle this issue, none of them has become an official part of core Java package so far. Consequently, it is still hard to build reliable Internet-oriented 3D graphics programs providing the web users with the same realism and interactivity usually found on standalone applications. This paper proposes a based-on-Java framework to develop interactive 3D graphics applications embedded in web pages.

Among other capabilities, it allows users to: apply pre-defined metrics to components of a system at various levels (feature, class, cluster or the entire system); define new metrics, through mathematical formulae or Boolean selection, and apply them to projects; store measurement results, as well as metric definitions, into an XML archive that can be stored locally or made available on the Web for future reference; and compare the measurements on a system to those on record locally or on a Web site.

"Tutorial 1: Utility-Oriented Grid Computing and the Gridbus Middleware","R. Buyya","Computer Science and Software Engineering, The University of Melbourne, Australia",15th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications (ADCOM 2007),"7 Jan 2008","2007","","","xxiii","xxiv","Grid computing, one of the latest buzzwords in the ICT industry, is emerging as a new paradigm for Internet-based parallel and distributing computing. It enables the sharing, selection, and aggregation of geographically distributed autonomous resources, such as computers (PCs, servers, clusters, supercomputers), databases, and scientific instruments, for solving large-scale problems in science, engineering, and commerce. It leverages existing IT infrastructure to optimize compute resources and manage data and computing workloads. The developers of Grids and Grid applications need to address numerous challenges: security, heterogeneity, dynamicity, scalability, reliability, service creation and pricing, resource discovery, resource management, application dAbsecomposition and service composition, and qualify of services. A number of projects around the world are developing technologies that help address one or more of these challenges. To address some of these challenges, the Gridbus Project at the University of Melbourne has developed grid middleware technologies that (1) enable the creation of Utility Grids, which provide economic incentive for Grid service providers for sharing resources; and (2) support rapid development and optimal deployment of eScience and eBusiness applications on enterprise and global Grids. The components of Gridbus middleware are: Grid application development environment for rapid creation of distributed applications, Grid service broker and application scheduler, Grid workflow management engine, SLA (service-level agreements) based Scheduler for clusters, Web-services based Grid market directory (GMD), Grid accounting services, Gridscape for creation of dynamic and interactive resource monitoring portals, Portlets for creation of Grid portals that support web-based management of Grid applications execution, and GridSim toolkit for performance evaluation. In addition, Gridbus also includes a widely used .NET-based enterprise Grid technology and Grid web services framework to support the integration of both Windows and Unix-class resources for Grid computing.","","0-7695-3059-1","10.1109/ADCOM.2007.7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4425933","","","","","","","IEEE","7 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It accomplishes this by loading and executing a test programpsilas compiled executable code. Code execution enables the test executive to control the instruments, make decisions and direct the testing in accordance with the instructions contained in the test program. In addition to this primary basic function; Test Executives can be enhanced to provide additional options to improve overall testing and diagnosis. Debug tools can also be built into the test executive in order to provide a rich set of debug options for the test engineer. These options should be readily useable and easy to perceive. Also, since diagnosis is a huge part of Unit Under Test (UUT) testing, the debug capabilities should be vast and readily utilizable. In addition, backward compatibility, built-in securities, ease of operator use, reliability, and maintainability should also be considered in order to produce the ultimate test executive. Keeping this in mind, a team of experienced test engineers designed and developed a test executive (known as the WT2000) rich with execution options, debug tools, development tools and other vital TPS aids the overall performance of a strong test executive as a result of these enhancements and will be discussed in detail in this paper. The vastness or strength of debug tools and will also be discussed in this paper. This paper doesn't merely identify options and user friendliness of a test executive, but also the paper explains a real application and an actual test environment and the various techniques an operator and an engineer can utilize to perform test and diagnosis. The paper will also explain the use of a Test Station Emulator and how it allows test programs to be run and debugged using work stations not connected to the test system. Also, shown and explained will be in-depth debug capabilities and Soft Front Panels that allow instruments to be controlled from the test system's computer console.

Unfortunately, web applications are also frequently targeted by attackers, and critical vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting and SQL injection are still common. As a consequence, much effort in the past decade has been spent on mitigating web application vulnerabilities. Current techniques focus mainly on sanitization: either on automated sanitization, the detection of missing sanitizers, the correctness of sanitizers, or the correct placement of sanitizers. However, these techniques are either not able to prevent new forms of input validation vulnerabilities such as HTTP Parameter Pollution, come with large runtime overhead, lack precision, or require significant modifications to the client and/or server infrastructure. In this paper, we present IPAAS, a novel technique for preventing the exploitation of cross-site scripting and SQL injection vulnerabilities based on automated data type detection of input parameters. IPAAS automatically and transparently augments otherwise insecure web application development environments with input validators that result in significant and tangible security improvements for real systems. We implemented IPAAS for PHP and evaluated it on five real-world web applications with known cross-site scripting and SQL injection vulnerabilities. Our evaluation demonstrates that IPAAS would have prevented 83% of SQL injection vulnerabilities and 65% of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities while incurring no developer burden.","0730-3157","978-0-7695-4736-7","10.1109/COMPSAC.2012.34","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6340148","web application;security;input validation;sql injection;cross-site scripting","HTML;Security;Robustness;Runtime;Vectors;Databases;Context","","33","7","37","IEEE","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Web Lab was designed to help disseminate the research results. It enables remote use of a design environment for database applications, including a repository for application development that provides a protected workspace.

In particular, the separation of the client- and the server-side, being only connected through the unidirectional Hypertext Transfer Protocol, forces developers to apply two programming languages including different libraries, conventions, and tools. Developers create expert knowledge by specializing on a few of all involved technologies. Consequently, the diverse knowledge of team members makes collaboration in Web development laboriously. We present the Orca framework that allows developers to work collaboratively on client-server applications in a single object-oriented programming language. Based on the Smalltalk programming language, full access to existing libraries, and a bidirectional messaging abstraction, Orca provides a consistent environment that supports common idioms and patterns in client- and server-side code.

This has inspired a pressing need to adopt new methodologies and abstract models which support system acquisition for self-adaptation, thus guaranteeing autonomic cloud application behaviour.

This paper discusses the implementation of such a directory service. Besides being an online phone directory, this system also provides additional staff information such as staff photographs and their academic interests. This Staff Directory is built to supplement other applications such as NTU Helpdesk, Electronic Mail and Staff Administration applications. In order to meet this object, the Staff Directory needs to be built based on a client-server model in a heterogeneous environment. MS-Windows 3.1 has been chosen as the common GUI platform for integrating the various campus information services. For the Staff Directory, the client development tools used include Asymmetrix's ToolBook and Borland's Turbo C++. The server is based on a Vaxstation 4000 running VMS. The server development tools used include VAX C, and the DDS (Distributed File System) file system. DDS was chosen because it was already in use by the campus-wide electronic mail application in NTU. For communications between the client and the server, DECmessageQ for MS-DOS and VMS are used. DECmessageQ was chosen because it can work in a multivendor environment and has advanced features such as message recovery services and selective broadcast services. More importantly, with a simple set of only 12 calls, it simplifies and expedites the development of interprocess communications by hiding the complexities of underlying network protocols such as DECnet, TCP/IP, SNA and etc.","","0-7803-1445-X","10.1109/SICON.1993.515686","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=515686","","IEEE Staff Directory;Postal services;Computer networks;Network servers;Application software;Electronic mail;Voice mail;Object oriented programming;Graphical user interfaces;File servers","","","4","10","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a framework built on the top of a cloud aware programming platform (mOSAIC) for the development of bag-of-tasks scientific applications. The framework integrates a cloud-based simulation environment able to predict the behavior of the developed applications. Simulations enable the developer to predict at an early development stage performance and cloud resource usage, and so the infrastructure lease cost on a public cloud. The paper sketches the framework organization and discusses the approach followed for application development. Moreover, some validation tests of prediction results are presented.","","978-1-4799-8448-0","10.1109/SYNASC.2014.61","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7034711","Cloud Computing;bag of tasks;scientific applications;mosaic;simulation;performance prediction","Computational modeling;Predictive models;Benchmark testing;Corporate acquisitions;Load modeling;Prediction algorithms;Cloud computing","","2","","32","IEEE","9 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Within the framework, there is a service platform consisting of the SIP application server, which is used to build call routing/telephony and IMPP (instant message and presence) services using SIP servlets, and a Web application server. There are also distributed service building blocks providing basic building blocks such as an IVR system, media server, TTS server and conference server. All these building blocks from different vendors can be registered in the UDDI registry for dynamic binding at run time. SOAP is used to transfer control information among different components. Meanwhile, the building blocks can be packaged as deployable units with an SIP interface for establishing IMPP and media sessions and with a SOAP interface for providing dynamic control information. The proposed framework will be beneficial to service developers so that they can use familiar Web development tools instead of proprietary APIs to develop new media applications. It will be also useful for service providers or integrators to easily and quickly deploy new services, which are allowed to be distributed remotely and configured using standard protocols. In addition, the proposed framework will be helpful for end users to access innovative multimedia services, which offer interactions with different features at relatively low cost. It is shown that a number of innovative services could be built using this framework.","","0-7695-1857-5","10.1109/MMSE.2002.1181598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1181598","","Web services;Simple object access protocol;Streaming media;Speech synthesis;Multimedia systems;Network servers;Web server;Java;Routing;Telephony","","2","15","9","IEEE","25 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SOCK comprises eight modules - architecture, process, integration, environment, technology, development, management, and roadmap. Each module addresses specific technical concerns in particular areas. SOA provides the service definitions, service catalog, service composition, scope of applications and portfolios, and service architecture modeling methodology. SOP deals with the business process management, process modeling and notations, process orchestration, coordination/collaborations, human interactions, and 1-phase commit compensation for long-lived processes. SOI concentrates on the service interoperability, integration patterns, enterprise service bus, traditional synchronous/asynchronous enterprise application integration, and integration with portals and content management systems. SOE consists of the runtime infrastructure, service registry for discovery and directory, service transformation/routing gateway, service virtualization via grid computing, and quality-of-services compliance with service-level agreements. SOT covers the implementation technologies - Web services, standards and specifications, technical patterns, convergence, and aspect-oriented techniques. SOD is composed of the development lifecycle, programming model, design/development tools, frameworks, reusable utilities/toolkits/components, and model-driven approaches. SOM includes services & policies repository in service identification and categorization, security mechanisms, business activity monitoring, reporting, BI, and provisioning. SOR handles the planning/blueprint, strategy, KPI dashboards, governance, and organization. The elements in each module are further decomposed to form loose semantic associations.

Historically these embedded networks have been implemented using field busses such as CAN, Lon Works, or Profi Net but the ubiquitous nature and low cost of Ethernet has made it the trend in embedded network applications. Ethernet, however, largely depends on DHCP and DNS servers or static IP addressing scheme to enable communication between devices on the network. This paper presents a service-oriented architecture for self-configuring Ethernet-based distributed control systems that is able to adapt to changes in network topology without manual intervention. The three core technologies used to enable self-configuration are all part of Zero Configuration Networking: link-local address auto-configuration for automatic IP address assignment, multicast DNS for automatic hostname resolution, and multicast DNS service discovery for automatic discovery of services. A temperature control system is developed as a case study implementation of the architecture using Java and SOAP web services. Programming web services is simplified using the Java API for XML-Web Services. Programmer productivity is also improved since Java enables the use of enterprise level development tools for debugging and deployment.","","978-1-4577-0524-3","10.1109/ISPAW.2011.29","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5951968","distributed control system;embedded systems;zero configuration networking;Ethernet;Java platform","Temperature sensors;Instruments;Web services;Java;Computer architecture;Embedded systems","","1","1","9","IEEE","14 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such management systems typically rely on a policy designer ensuring that a high level policy creates the necessary invocations or events to trigger the correct low level policies (and their implementation). The difficulty with this approach is that human error in the policy design can lead to feature interaction problems, conflicts and errors (Chomicki et al., 2003 and Lupu and Sloman, 1999). This refinement problem is a key challenge for policy based management to be adopted widely within service management (voted #1 key challenge at Policy 2005 panel session). In this paper we concentrate on policy based management of Web services, where the Web services have adaptive behaviors. The paper proposes the design, implementation and evaluation of a suite of policy development tools which (i) facilitate the specification of adaptive Web services (which are to be managed by a policy based system) using finite state machines to describe the permitted adaptive behaviors, (ii) supports the specification of supportable (functionally correct) high level management policies, the automated refinement of these high level policies and the auto-generation of enforceable (low level) policies. The paper also presents an evaluation of the systems with particular reference to the usability of the proposed solution. The paper also provides a brief presentation of related research in policy refinement and distinguishes the proposed approach from published work. Finally the paper concludes by drawing initial findings and identifies future work.","1573-0077","1-4244-0798-2","10.1109/INM.2007.374837","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4258589","","Web services;Resource management;Ontologies;Automata;Computer science;Educational institutions;Engineering management;Humans;Usability;Security","","1","","11","IEEE","25 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Platform as a service (PaaS) encapsulates a layer of software that includes middleware, and even development environment, and provides them as a service for building and deploying cloud applications. In PaaS, the issue of on-demand infrastructure resource management becomes more challenging due to the thousands of cloud applications that share and compete for resources simultaneously. The fundamental solution is to integrate and coordinate the resource consumption and allocation management of a cloud application. The difficulties of such a solution in PaaS are essentially how to maximize the resource utilization of an application, and how to allocate resources to guarantee adequate resource provision for the system. In this paper, we propose an approach to managing infrastructure resources in PaaS by leveraging two adaptive control loops: the resource consumption optimization loop and the resource allocation loop. The optimization loop improves the resource utilization of a cloud application via management functions provided by the corresponding middleware layers of PaaS. The allocation loop provides or reclaims appropriate amounts of resources to/from the application system while guaranteeing its performance. The two loops are integrated to run consecutively and repeatedly to provide infrastructure resources on-demand by first trying to improve resource utilization, and then allocating more resources when necessary. We implement a framework, SmartRod, to investigate our approach. The experiment on SmartRod proves its effectiveness on infrastructure resource management.","2159-6190","978-1-4244-8207-8","10.1109/CLOUD.2010.11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5558007","Resource Consumption and Allocation;Infrastructure Resources on-Demand;SmartRod;Integrated Control Loop;Middleware;Virtual Machine;Platform as a Service;PaaS","Resource management;Optimization;Clouds;Middleware;System performance;Monitoring;Benchmark testing","","29","4","25","IEEE","26 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we analyze interoperability requirements of the distributed earth system scientific data sharing platform (ESSDSP) in the first place. Then the general framework of the platform based on service-oriented architecture (SOA) is designed. This platform comprises one main center, one authentication center and several sub-centers in which core functions are encapsulated into Web services. Through this incompact architecture, it can not only implement the interoperability among distributed data centers, but also easily integrate other software systems. Furthermore, these Web services can be accessed by third party software such as e-business, e-government and so on to achieve data sharing function. Finally we introduce the design, implementation and deployment of some core Web services in detail, i.e. data centers' information synchronization service, distributed metadata synchronization management service and multi-resource data access service. This platform was deployed in Earth System Scientific Data Sharing Network(ESSDSN), one of National Infrastructure and Facility Development Environment Building for Science and Technology Industries Program of China.

The development environment has vastly changed over the last years. Development architectures of single database servers are replaced by message based exchange servers, cross application handling emerged, business demands change more rapidly and Web portals, Web services etc. require not only new tools to manage software maintenance, but also preventive maintenance tools as customer implementations extend. Those are complex with respect to the number of installations and also challenging in terms of users. A well designed product innovation lifecycle delivers already higher software quality upfront. SAP NetWeaver and the business process platform provide the base for reuse and composite architecture. Only combining preventive maintenance tools with the solution management process will support a lower total cost of ownership. Organizing this around 10,000 and plus developers distributed around the globe represents an additional challenge. The scope of the presentation is thus to outline these requirements within the context of SAP Labs development network including new upcoming challenges.","1534-5351","0-7695-2536-9","10.1109/CSMR.2006.41","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1602385","","","","","","","IEEE","10 Apr 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, in the proposed efficient resource allocation mechanism, Job Centric Cosine Similarity based K-Means ( JCC K-Means) is used to cluster the resources dynamically based on user request and improved branch and bound based assignment algorithm is used for efficient allocation of cloud resources to user request. The proposed work is simulated and compared with K-means and Random Allocation.

Most existing systems store data in specialized databases with built-in concurrency control policies, usually implemented via locking. It is desirable to construct such collaborative systems on top of the World Wide Web, but most Web servers do not support even conventional transactions, let alone distributed (multi-Website) transactions or flexible concurrency control mechanisms oriented toward team work-such as event notification, shared locks, and fine granularity locks. We present a transaction server that operates independently of Web servers or the collaborative systems, to fill the concurrency control gap. By default, the transaction server enforces the conventional atomic transaction model, where sets of operations are performed in an all-or-nothing fashion and isolated from concurrent users. The server can be tailored dynamically to apply more sophisticated concurrency control policies appropriate for collaboration. The transaction server also supports applications employing information resources other than Web servers, such as legacy databases, CORBA objects, and other hypermedia systems. Our implementation permits a wide range of system architecture styles.","1558-2191","","10.1109/69.790823","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=790823","","World Wide Web;Concurrency control;Web server;Transaction databases;Collaborative work;Collaborative software;Design automation;Computer aided manufacturing;CADCAM;Programming","","6","1","46","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While promoting a systems building approach, we have successfully added support for programming in the small and the needs of the isolated novice. Two guiding principles have been: (i) the environment and its modules fit into a consistent structure for personal management of learning and (ii) details of complex facilities, such as the class library, are progressively disclosed as knowledge and sophistication grow. The paper shows how these principles have guided the exploitation of LearningBook modules. To provide context, relevant academic background is given.

Existing approaches have in common that they are either limited to a set of predefined, hardcoded questions, or that they require to learn a specific query language only suitable for that limited purpose. We present a framework to query for information about a software system using guided-input natural language resembling plain English. For that, we model data extracted by classical software analysis tools with an OWL ontology and use knowledge processing technologies from the Semantic Web to query it.

This practice has never been the target of empirical research in JavaScript. Yet, understanding it is key to adequately tuning programming environments and structure libraries such that they are accessible to programmers. In this paper we report on a large and in-depth study to understand how class emulation is employed in JavaScript applications. We propose a strategy to statically detect class-based abstractions in the source code of JavaScript systems. We used this strategy in a dataset of 50 popular JavaScript applications available from GitHub. We found four types of JavaScript software: class-free (systems that do not make any usage of classes), class-aware (systems that use classes, but marginally), class-friendly (systems that make a relevant usage of classes), and class-oriented (systems that have most of their data structures implemented as classes).

In accordance with such a penetration of the Internet, it is increasing public awareness of the importance of online real-time and interactive functions. Therefore, software development environment has been changing into new development paradigms such as concurrent distributed development environment and the so-called open source project by using network computing technologies. Especially, such OSS (open source software) systems which serve as key components of critical infrastructures in our society are still ever-expanding now. In this paper, we propose a software reliability growth model based on stochastic differential equations in order to consider the active state of the open source project. Especially, we assume that the software failure intensity depends on the time, and the software fault-report phenomena on the bug tracking system keep an irregular state.

Moreover, we compare our model with the conventional model based on stochastic differential equations in terms of goodness-of-fit for actual data.

These systems are generally characterized by complex interactions with the environment in which they operate and strict time constraints whose violation may have catastrophic consequences. The need for these software systems to be highly reliable is evident. One way to achieve this reliability is through formal development. Although research in the area of real time systems has been quite active and a number of experimental environments supporting formal specifications have been developed, the search for adequate notations and tools is still ongoing. In order to get designers to use formal methods to develop real time systems it is necessary to provide them with an integrated set of tools for writing and analyzing their specifications. The ASTRAL Software Development Environment (SDE), which is an integrated set of tools based on the ASTRAL formal framework, is intended to meet this need. The tools that make up the support environment are a syntax directed editor, a specification processor, a verification condition generator, a mechanical theorem prover, and a browser kit. The paper discusses the goals for ASTRAL, why they were important, and how they were met. It also gives an overview of the ASTRAL Software Development Environment.","","0-8186-8002-4","10.1109/ICFEM.1997.630415","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=630415","","Real time systems;Writing;Programming;Time factors;Software systems;Formal specifications;Application software;Aerospace electronics;Software performance;Computer science","","1","","5","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"A system-level approach to designing modular switching software","T. Sarfi","VTI Instruments Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA",2011 IEEE AUTOTESTCON,"24 Oct 2011","2011","","","428","434","The system switch plays a crucial role in any automated test system as it provides ATE engineers the ability to distribute a finite amount of instrumentation I/O to multiple test points. The popularity of modular architectures such as VXI and PXI, created an opportunity for consolidation of instrumentation and switching within a single mainframe, resulting in high-channel count capability in a reduced footprint. A modular approach to switching systems also affords the ATE architect design flexibility through the use of domain-specific modules (i.e, power, RF, and analog) that can be combined to cover a broad range of the signal spectrum. Unfortunately, software development and integration can become unnecessarily complicated when the system switch is viewed simply as a collection of discrete modules that are assembled to accommodate the required I/O count. This paper will discuss web-based methodologies and software platforms that VTI Instruments has developed to create a versatile system-level switching programming environment. This framework, which is implemented on web-enabled LXI-based modular switch instruments, significantly reduces test program set development time and simplifies debugging and design validation activities without the overhead of third party configuration tools.","1558-4550","978-1-4244-9363-0","10.1109/AUTEST.2011.6058757","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6058757","","Switches;Relays;Instruments;Software;Radio frequency;Wiring;Switching systems","","1","","4","IEEE","24 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Software engineering activities that involve program comprehension (e.g., maintenance) require the use of forward engineering tools (e.g., compilers) as well as reverse engineering tools (e.g., class hierarchy visualizers). Thus, extending forward engineering tools such as IDEs (e.g., Eclipse) or Web authoring tools (e.g., GoLive) by seamlessly adding program comprehension functionality helps software engineers and improves the adoption of comprehension functionality.

Conventional power systems are designed to operate on sinusoidal power supply. Electric utilities strive to supply consumers with reliable & pure sinusoidal electric power that does not represent a damaging threat to their equipment. In the restructured power system, prices of the power are associated to power Quality. Hence it is very important to monitor and ensure Power Quality. Harmonics is the major issue in this context. This paper presents an innovative way of real time harmonic measurement using ADE 7880 and its assessment with automatic meter reading (AMR) on smart phone. During preparation of this paper fifty sight visits are done covering the non-linear loads like IT Industries, Steel Industries, Paper Industries, workshops etc. It is observed that the current harmonics generated are beyond the tolerable limits. Readings are taken at consumer end with the help of standard power analyzer for a period of 24 hrs. Sample of the readings are considered for analysis purpose. Further it is also observed that many literatures are available in the area of Harmonic measurement but they do not have the capacity to identify the limits of harmonics as per the standards used like IEC 61000-2-2 or IEEE 519-1996 or EN 50160. In this paper GUI is developed in java to assess the harmonics and identify the harmonic presence with specific color codes. The solution will display the abnormal harmonics in red color and normal below the threshold value by the green color. Through this color coding technique an unskilled worker can easily identify the objectionable presence of harmonics. It creates the awareness in the utility for measurement and control of harmonics which in turn helps to improve the Power Quality. A combined Zigbee and GSM technology is also developed to communicate the data received at consumer end to the central server. Along with the central PC information can also be transferred on smart phone by capturing the data from remote location and processing it with a programming tool on smart phone. The main advantage of this method is Remote data logging, as it does not require collecting data physically from actual site. The numeric meter sends data to microcontroller using zigbee module and further to the web server of Central Monitoring System through GSM. This data is processed and analyzed by the source code available in smart phone. For this purpose, the relevant compilers can be installed in the smart phone.","","978-1-4799-6085-9","10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226173","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7226173","Automatic Meter Reading (AMR);Central Monitoring System (CMS);Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM);Harmonic distortion;Harmonic standard;Non-linear load;Point of common coupling (PCC);Sampling;Smart Phone;Total Harmonic Distortion (THD);Zigbee","Transmitters;Flowcharts;GSM;Energy measurement;Relays;Receivers;Monitoring","","2","","13","IEEE","27 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The fuzzy neural network provides an automatic and autonomous product classification and selection scheme to support fuzzy decision making by integrating fuzzy logic technology and the backpropagation feed forward neural network. In addition, a new visual data model is introduced to overcome the limitations of the current Web browsers that lack flexibility for customers to view products from different perspectives. Such a model also extends the conventional data warehouse schema to deal with intensive data volumes and complex transformations with a high degree of flexibility for multiperspective visualization and morphing capability in an interactive environment. Furthermore, an agent development tool named ""Aglet"" is used as a programming framework for system implementation. The integration of dynamic object visualization, interactive user interface and data mining decision support provides an effective technique to close the gap between the ""real world"" and the ""cyber world"" from a business perspective.

To date, the implementation of semantic services has remained minute both in academia and industry. This is commonly attributed to barriers, such as the complex and heterogeneous semantic description languages, and a lack of mature methods and unified tools that aim to facilitate the development of such services. Moreover, the current solutions that assert to facilitate the development of semantic services are fragmented (i.e. developers are required to use a combination of disconnected tools to realize semantic services). This usually leads to a number of challenges, such as prolonged service development time. Furthermore, existing semantic service development platforms are tightly-coupled to specific semantic description languages, leading to restrictive development environments. This paper proposes a generic and unified approach for designing and developing semantic web services exploiting the Eclipse platform. The key is in using common techniques such as UML - for modelling a variety of semantic services' artefacts, and Acceleo - for automatic code generations of semantic services' artefacts. The main contributions in the proposed solution are: (1) support for the specification and generation of semantic services using multiple semantic description languages, (2) seamless modelling and development of services within a unified environment, and (3) minimization of the barriers associated with the development of semantic services through complexity hiding; decoupling; and extensibility.","","978-1-908320-08-7","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6470919","Semantic Web Services;UML;Acceleo;Eclipse;WSMO;OWL-S","Unified modeling language;Semantics;Ontologies;Syntactics","","1","","29","","11 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Analysis shows a wide variation in productivity from best- to poorest-performing individuals. A single programmer out of a workforce of almost 200 did Eight percent of the work. A variation of 200:1 separated the top programmer from the poorest performers. The top 27% of programmers did 78% of the work. This paper updates and comments on the original 1994 paper, answering questions that readers have raised in the intervening years. The prior paper had a wide following: 240,000 IEEE Xplore citations and 8900 web hits. The programming environment was stable and uniform over the time period: education, training, general ability level, work environment, development tools, and methodology were all the same or similar. The development lab was remote from company headquarters and thus largely isolated from outside distractions and influences. Programmers typically were concurrently responsible for both maintenance of existing code and development of new functions, often for the same code module(s). The average productivity of the group is several times higher than industry averages and this fact is demonstrably not caused by excessive documentation or verbose code; both were efficient in comparison to similar systems. The wide variation in productivity is apparently due to individual ability. Training, tools, methodology, and education, while important, cannot make up for individual ability. To get an accurate project plan the extremely wide range of variation in individual productivity must be taken into account. A project can only be on time and on budget if the widely varying abilities of the staff are taken into account. One person, 2 people, or 20 people depending on individual ability may properly staff a project.","1095-323X","978-1-4577-0557-1","10.1109/AERO.2012.6187328","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6187328","","Productivity;Computers;Databases;Operating systems;Educational institutions;Maintenance engineering","","","","9","IEEE","19 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is intended to support the development and maintenance of a knowledge-based real-time control system. The features of a programming tool which combines characteristics of expert systems and real-time supervision systems are explained. The system is used for online diagnosis of a plant. The real-time properties are achieved by dividing data processing into several processing units which are computed in parallel. Since plant diagnosis differs from most expert system applications, the expert system part has been developed with regard to this. A prototype of this system has been implemented for the domain of thermal spraying.<>","","0-8186-2030-7","10.1109/PCCC.1990.101701","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=101701","","Real time systems;Expert systems;Diagnostic expert systems;Thermal spraying;Artificial intelligence;Electrical equipment industry;Power generation;Control systems;Data processing;Concurrent computing","","1","1","7","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, web applications are prone to JavaScript faults. While prior studies have demonstrated the prevalence of these faults, no attempts have been made to determine their root causes and consequences. Objective: The goal of our study is to understand the root causes and impact of JavaScript faults and how the results can impact JavaScript programmers, testers and tool developers. Method: We perform an empirical study of 317 bug reports from 12 bug repositories. The bug reports are thoroughly examined to classify and extract information about the fault's cause (the error) and consequence (the failure and impact). Result: The majority (65%) of JavaScript faults are DOM-related, meaning they are caused by faulty interactions of the JavaScript code with the Document Object Model (DOM). Further, 80% of the highest impact JavaScript faults are DOM-related. Finally, most JavaScript faults originate from programmer mistakes committed in the JavaScript code itself, as opposed to other web application components such as the server-side or HTML code. Conclusion: Given the prevalence of DOM-related faults, JavaScript programmers need development tools that can help them reason about the DOM. Also, testers should prioritize detection of DOM-related faults as most high impact faults belong to this category. Finally, developers can use the error patterns we found to design more powerful static analysis tools for JavaScript.","1949-3789","978-0-7695-5056-5","10.1109/ESEM.2013.18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6681338","JavaScript;Document Object Model (DOM);empirical study","Libraries;Computer bugs;HTML;XML;Servers;Electronic mail;Data mining","","59","","31","IEEE","12 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Only recently has there been an emphasis on monitoring bandwidth in a network, and adjusting service quality depending on the current bandwidth. One important aspect on which little research has been done is: ""how can users specify the requirements and priorities by which multimedia quality should be adjusted given bandwidth limitations""? We design a quality of service (QoS) specification strategy and delivery criteria using adaptive bandwidth monitoring that best fits the specifications to the available resources. In order to provide QoS-based delivery a prioritization method has been designed to order information according to the preferences of a user. Java applets and CGI programming tools are used to provide an interactive Web retrieval environment. At present, JPEG quality, resolution and delay are used as parameters to determine the QoS. We are extending the work to include video delivery and distributed implementation with QoS in the future.","","0-7803-6490-2","10.1109/EURCON.2001.938167","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=938167","","Bandwidth;Monitoring;Quality of service;Streaming media;Java;Web and internet services;Computer networks;Multimedia communication;Multimedia computing;Design methodology","","9","","13","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most conventional Internet applications have been built on three tiers - Web, application, and database tiers as described in the predominant 3-tier architectural style on both Java EE and .Net platforms. However, a number of leading-edge technologies have matured, which need to be incorporated into the logical solution architecture, such as portal, process choreography, business rule engine, enterprise service bus, Web services, service composition, etc. A new service-oriented model is proposed in this paper, to extend the traditional 3-tier architectural style and position the emerging technologies/products in the right places in the architecture structure. This new architecture model comprises a stack of six interrelated layers, coupled with six vertical pillars. The six layers are access & integration, business process, composite services, services & components, integration & communications, and enterprise resources layer. The runtime infrastructure pillars are composed of the operational management, security, and hosting environment pillar, whereas the development process pillars consist of the application & service frameworks, crosscutting aspects & patterns, and modeling & development tools pillar. This holistic application architecture framework is a systematic taxonomy of major technical constituents of a distributed application in a service-oriented paradigm. Part of this comprehensive model has been extensively utilized in one form or another to design various SOA solutions in different industry sectors","","0-7695-2670-5","10.1109/SCC.2006.99","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4026951","","Service oriented architecture;Internet;Databases;Java;Portals;Search engines;Web services;Business communication;Runtime environment;Environmental management","","9","2","20","IEEE","11 Dec 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because of the challenges in programming such architectures, realizing this promise has proved to be difficult. In this paper, we describe the design of Lagniappe, a programming environment that simplifies the design of portable, high-throughput applications on multi-* architectures. Lagniappe uses a hybrid programming model: it combines a procedural specification (e.g., in C++) of the basic operators for processing requests with a declarative specification - expressed using a model-driven development framework - of the various features of the operators and the target hardware platform. Using the declarative specification, the Lagniappe programming environment automates the mapping of applications onto the multi-* platform, performs dynamic allocation of resources to operators, and ensures efficient and coherent accesses to persistent, shared state.","1095-2055","978-1-4244-1250-1","10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4317815","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4317815","","Process design;Computer architecture;Service oriented architecture;Intrusion detection;Programming environments;Hardware;Virtual private networks;Computer graphics;Web server;Dynamic programming","","","","28","IEEE","24 Sep 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are several characteristics specific to E-learning system such as Interaction, Personalization, Adaptation, Intelligence, Interoperability, Accessibility and Security. Agent based architecture for E-learning system provides the above mentioned features to support instructional design, to retrieve relevant learning materials, to process and analyze data to enable meaningful E-learning recommendations to instructors and learners. But most of the existing E-learning architectures doesn't consider all the features in a single system.

Furthermore, a feedback mechanism gives the meta-search engine the user's suggestions about the found documents, which leads to a new query using a genetic algorithm. In the new search stage, more relevant documents are given to the user. The practical experiments were performed in Aglets programming environment.

There are identified incentives to the transfer of breast cancer follow-up care to family physicians after primary treatment has been completed by oncologists at the tertiary care centers. This paper presents a semantic web approach to develop a clinical decision support system to support family physicians to provide breast cancer follow-up care. Our approach involved the computerization and execution of a breast cancer follow-up clinical practice guideline. The computerization of the clinical practice guideline led to the development of a breast cancer ontology. We present our breast cancer ontology which models the knowledge inherent within the breast cancer follow-up clinical practice guideline - the breast cancer ontology serves as the knowledge source to determine patient-specific recommendations. In this paper, we discuss the ontology engineering process that highlights the specification of our breast cancer ontology in terms of clinical concepts and the relationships between the concepts expressed as OWL classes and properties, using the protege ontology development tool.","1063-7125","0-7695-2905-4","10.1109/CBMS.2007.80","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4262705","","Ontologies;Breast cancer;Guidelines;Decision support systems;Semantic Web;OWL;Computer science;Decision making;Path planning;Embedded computing","","13","","9","IEEE","25 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The reverse modeling phase applies clustering and clone detection techniques and is supported by an Eclipse IDE environment. The forward design phase is supported by a set of UWA modeling tools which are built on top of the Eclipse Graphical Editing Framework (GEF) and of the Eclipse Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF) and that allow developers to evolve the recovered models.

While modifying aspects of the game is straight forward in traditional board games, achieving such a level of customization in the digital domain requires deep knowledge of and access to the game source code. In this paper we focus on board games and by means of an in-depth online survey we validate our previous observation, namely that enhancements should be made to digital board games by incorporating gaming facets found in the physical environment,e.g. support for flexibility by means of house rules. To this end,we introduce a conceptual model for the design of digital board games, which is supported by a set of visual programming tools to enable game development according to the principles set out by our proposed model.

The key aspect of such a verification task is the model adopted for representing the communications among the services participating to the composition. In this paper, we propose to extend this approach to handle dependencies between activities of different process orchestrations through message exchanges. Our aim is to enable supporting models of service choreography with multiple interacting Web services compositions, from the perspective of a collaborative distributed composition development environment.

Experiments of grain drying in a deep fixed-bed usually have characteristics of long period, difficult dynamic signal acquisition, large amount of experimental data and cockamamie data processing, etc. Aiming at the disadvantages of tiresome procedure, low efficiency and big error which exist in the traditional manual record and data processing mode for test process, an automatic multiparameters collecting and processing system for the experiments of grain drying in a deep fixed-bed is developed. The system mainly consists of two parts: testing software of master computer, hardware and software of slave computer. A microcontroller is used as the central control unit of the slave computer. Both design of the hardware interface circuit and the data acquisition program have been accomplished. Analog signals of sensors are collected and sent to the master computer by serial communication mode. Software of data processing and analysis used for the master computer operation is developed by using software development tool Excel and VBA on the base of software engineering method, theories of grain drying and experimental design method. The software can automatically analyze and process the regulate control parameters of drying air temperature, drying air velocity, humidity, paddy thickness and intermittent drying time, which were all collected and sent by the slave computer system,and then it can give regression equations and graphics of influence laws of each regulate control parameter on paddy rice dried-quality( additional crack percentage, drying homogeneous degree and drying time, etc.) automatically by applying the function modules of regression analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) and parameterization drawing, etc. A series of paddy drying experiments including single-factor experiments and quadratic orthogonal rotary combination experiments in a deep fixed-bed were conducted with the developed system. The results showed that the system works stably and reliably by compared with the traditional manual record, while labor intensity and interference on data processing of manual operation cloud be decreased during the drying experimental study, and data analysis precision and reliability of experiments also be improved.","2154-4824","978-1-889335-42-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5665500","Grain drying;Data acquisition;processing;system;Serial communication;Regression analysis","Computers;Temperature measurement;Data processing;Software;Hardware;Data acquisition;Process control","","","","10","","10 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Xilinx Jbits 3.0 API (Application Program Interface) is used to implement the BISTER structure in the FPGA. By using Jbits, we can reconfigure dynamically the device, in which the partial bit stream only affects part of the device. In the comparison to the traditional FPGA development tool (ISE), Jbits is faster to map the specific portion of the circuit to a specific tile.

Standard and de facto software languages such as C and Java were used with off-the-shelf development tools to implement the embedded network node applications and the web-based application, respectively. Internet-based TCP/IP protocols and Ethernet technology were used to design the networking infrastructure. The distributed measurement and control concept with networking sensors and actuators should work quite well with advanced system design, particularly where sensor-based monitoring and control applications are important. Taking this approach in system design can reduce the total life-cycle cost of the system by use of modular sensor system design and commercially available smart transducers with standardized interfaces, and easy maintenance and upgrade via simple plug-and-play sensor and actuator components.

Wide use of the Internet motivated us to develop seamless remote and actual hardware laboratories for hardware design laboratory course. Unlike existing virtual laboratories, the proposed remote laboratory utilizes actual hardware and actual measurement tools in a time sharing fashion. Hardware experimental environment is usually treated as an exclusive resource, for single user usage. However, the actual test run time is rather short and most of the time is wasted leaving those precious resources idle. To make those resources operate more efficiently, it employs shared resources and enhanced service management scheme based on the Web services. It finds an available service site and schedules the executable processing. The combinatorial use of FPGA/PC connected test hardware and PC based measurement equipments such as logic analyzer or pattern generator has make it possible to develop a remote multi-user time sharing hardware experiment system, where students at remote sites can perform actual experiments using actual hardware equipments and tools concurrently. As all students are equipped with high performance laptop PCs, CPU intensive tasks such as development of the digital circuits for FPGA can be off-loaded from the server host and can be performed by each student's client PC. A floating license scheme allows students through the Internet to utilize commercial FPGA development tools. Thus, we created virtual private network to access the floating license server over firewalls. Such a rich client configuration allows the server to concentrate on the service management tasks, such as hardware resource managements. The prototype system is scheduled to be used for the third grade CS students from year 2005.","","0-7803-9141-1","10.1109/ITHET.2005.1560228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560228","Time-sharing remote laboratory;Web services;Shared Resource Management;Shared Service Management;Shared-Lab","Time sharing computer systems;Remote laboratories;Hardware;Resource management;Field programmable gate arrays;Network servers;Web server;Digital circuits;Internet;Time measurement","","9","","14","IEEE","19 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While a DE can be realized using different technologies Web services (WS) are particularly promising due to their widespread acceptance within industry and academia, established and open standards, a wealth of development tools and infrastructures, and maybe most importantly the number of successful deployments. A key issue in the development/deployment of any system is the behaviour exhibited by components (e.g. providers & consumers). Service-oriented systems tend to use a contract approach in which implicit, predefined or negotiated service-level agreements (SLAs) are established between providers and consumers. A SLA defines from a provider's point of view the guaranties, responsibilities and warranties (e.g. availability, reliability, performance, throughput, compensations, etc) towards a consumer. While being conceptually fairly straightforward, SLAs have the unfortunate side effect of forcing providers to use reservation/locking of resources as a means of ensuring their availability should the consumer request them. This in turn leads to the problem of resource underutilization that threatens the efficiency of the service-oriented system. This paper focuses on the use of cooperation between providers and consumers in service ecologies as an alternative to the constraining SLAs. By enabling the consumers and providers to exchange information regarding their current needs and capabilities it becomes possible to better utilize the resources and therefore improve overall system performance.","2150-4946","978-1-4244-2345-3","10.1109/DEST.2009.5276778","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5276778","","Resource management;Environmental factors;Availability;Ecosystems;Web services;Standards development;Contracts;Warranties;Throughput;System performance","","2","","16","IEEE","2 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on these experiences we propose Rondo, a tool suite for deploying pervasive applications. Rondo includes a domain-specific language for declaratively describing applications, a deployment manager that can dynamically apply these descriptions and development tools for helping the description of applications. In this paper we present this tool suite and a set of deployment scenarios in which we validated our approach, including a web framework and a home automation platform.","","978-1-4799-8425-1","10.1109/PERCOMW.2015.7134025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7134025","","DSL;Assembly;Software;Context;Pervasive computing;Monitoring;Conferences","","","1","6","IEEE","29 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a proof of concept, we integrate COCA into the Android development environment and fully automate the new build process, making application programming and software maintenance easier. With COCA, mobile applications can now automatically offload part of the computation to the cloud, achieving better performance and longer battery life.

It is adaptive in that it brings the right set of collaboration elements to the user, in a manner sensitive to business context. It integrates collaboration elements across multiple sources, multiple modalities, and multiple vendor technologies. In addition, it integrates structured collaborative activities with ad hoc peer collaboration tools, and with the business processes at large.

More recently, the term has come to be associated-somewhat limitingly-with distributed platforms such as the Open Software Foundation's Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) and the Object Management Group's Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA). And some have loosely applied it to systems as diverse as workflow support environments and even to the Web itself. We believe the essential role of middleware is to manage the complexity and heterogeneity of distributed infrastructures and thereby provide a simpler programming environment for distributed-application developers. It is therefore most useful to define middleware as any software layer that is placed above the distributed system's infrastructure-the network OS and APIs-and below the application layer.","1941-045X","","10.1109/6294.793667","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=793667","","Distributed computing;Middleware;Sockets;Application software;Environmental management;Network servers;Protocols;Computer network management;Transaction databases;Computer architecture","","32","7","","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

An increasing number of JavaScript programs are parallelized to run efficiently on today's multicore CPUs, which are capable of dynamic core scaling (DCS) and voltage/frequency scaling (DVFS). However, significant power savings are still left on the table since an operating point (in terms of the number of active cores and CPU voltage/frequency) is selected by monitoring CPU utilization or OS events, without considering the user's performance goal. To address this, we propose QPR.js, a QoS-aware power-optimizing runtime system for JavaScript. Using the QPR.js API, the application developer can specify a QoS goal and provide a fitness function to quantify the current level of QoS. During execution the QPR.js runtime system uses this information to autonomously find an optimal operating point minimizing power consumption while satisfying the QoS goal.

It uses a web camera as a vision sensor, PC sound cards as output signal controllers, and two DC motors as a pan-tilt driver mechanism. The sound card is expected to produce a higher output signal in a PWM form to drive the motors. The motors will react accordingly when they receive the signals to ensure that the camera always focuses on the centroid of the light source. The system used image processing technique to detect and determine the location of the light source and was programmed to send PWM through the sound card to drive the motors to correct the error produced from the light movement. In MATLAB programming environment, a closed-loop control is implemented to provide interaction between camera and sound cards as devices to control the motors to track the light source. The system has been designed and tested with various locations of light source. The data which were obtained by experiments indicate the ability of the proposed controller.","","978-1-61284-437-4","10.1109/ICOM.2011.5937165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5937165","light tracking system;sound card;pulse-width modulation;data acquisition;image processing","Cameras;DC motors;Light sources;Image processing;Pulse width modulation;Tracking;Data acquisition","","","","9","IEEE","4 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A grammar that generates these webs is a context-free web grammar, and so a Chinese input simulator is a machine that accepts these webs. Developing such a simulator can be regarded as the construction of an user-defined application program.

Failure to ensure the health of livestock would cause to the death of animals and lead to decreased in productivity. Conventional methods by incorporating livestock data information on paper is a huge waste of time and not safe, therefore not effective for a good farming practiced. Hence, the electronic-based livestock management systems are needed to help farmers and livestock veterinary to share information for the purpose of early prevention of dangerous diseases from infected their livestock. In this project, the extensively use of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology for livestock health management in the preparation of animal profile has created a fast and efficient method, but several conditions have to be set such as the RFID frequency selection and numbers of livestock in the farms. In current practice, even though the RFID systems in animal rearing is not a new approach, but this project has successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of RFID technology comes to solve daily problems on farms. In developing this monitoring system, web-based application platform likes MySQL, Apache and JSP has been used in an integrated methods for reporting and recording of livestock health records. Furthermore, Java programming act as a script, MySQL as database and NetBeans IDE 7.2 is used for the development of the whole system. In order to ensure this system development costs can be reduced as much as possible, the RFID Based Livestock Health Management System was built using open source software. The use of laptops and portable RFID reader has made farmers easier to access their livestock health information in real time and then can be shared to the other interested parties.","","978-1-4799-6106-1","10.1109/SPC.2014.7086240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7086240","Middleware;RFID;Livestock;Health;Wearable Sensors","Agriculture;Animals;Portable computers;Graphical user interfaces;Java;RFID tags","","22","1","11","IEEE","16 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The number variety, and specialized configurations of these machines are increasing dramatically with 32-128 node clusters being commonplace in science labs. The evolving nature of the platform is to target generic PC hardware to specialized functions such as login, compute, Web server file server and a visualization engine. This is the logical extension to the standard login/compute dichotomy of traditional Beowulf clusters. Clearly, these specialized nodes (henceforth ""cluster appliances"") share an immense amount of common configuration and software. What is lacking in many clustering toolkits is the ability to share configuration across appliances and specific hardware (where it should be shared) and differentiate only where needed In the NPACI Rocks cluster distribution, we have developed a configuration infrastructure with well-defined inheritance properties that leverages and builds on de facto standards including: XML (with standard parsers), RedHat Kickstart, HTTP transport, CGI, SQL databases, and graph constructs to easily define cluster appliances. Our approach neither resorts to replication of configuration files nor does it require building a ""golden"" image reference. By relying on this descriptive and programmatic infrastructure and carefully demarking configuration information from the software packages (which is a bit delivery mechanism), we can easily handle the heterogeneity of appliances, easily deal with small hardware differences among particular instances of appliances (such as IDE vs. SCSI), and support large hardware differences (like /spl times/86 vs. IA64) with the same infrastructure. Our mechanism is easily extended to other descriptive infrastructures (such as Solaris Jumpstart as a backend target) and has been proven on over a 100 clusters (with significant hardware and configuration differences among these clusters).","","0-7695-1745-5","10.1109/CLUSTR.2002.1137728","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1137728","","Linux;Home appliances;Hardware;Standards development;Prototypes;Production;Web server;File servers;Visualization;Engines","","8","","11","IEEE","6 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fit stores the test specification separate from the test fixture code in an easily human readable and editable tabular form in HTML format. Additional tools like the FitPro plugin or FitN esse support the writing of test specifications and test fixtures from within the Eclipse IDE or the Web. With the increasing popularity of agile test-driven software development, maintenance of the evolving and growing test base has become an important issue. However, there has been no support yet for automated refactoring of Fit test cases. In a recent research project, we developed the Eclipse plugin ReFit for automated refactoring of Fit test cases. Fit test refactoring can occur due to changing requirements or changing Java code, which in either case means a cross-language refactoring to keep test specification and test fixture in sync. In this paper the concept for the development of the ReFit Eclipse Plugin is described, which significantly reduces the effort for Fit test maintenance and makes refactoring less error prone. Besides a tight integration into the existing Eclipse refactoring plugin, major goals of the plugin were to make it easy extensible for additional refactorings, new fixture types and further test specification file formats. Challenges faced when adding new and modifying existing Eclipse refactoring behavior are described and are due to the strong dependency on the Eclipse JDK and LTK features, and the solutions developed are presented.","2327-0772","978-1-4673-6288-7","10.1109/TOPI.2013.6597187","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6597187","Refactoring Automation;Maintenance;Plugin;Tools;Acceptance Testing","Fixtures;Maintenance engineering;Java;Synchronization;HTML;Software","","","","16","IEEE","16 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our previous research had added power consumption to the list of managed resources to help to understand and control power profile of the clusters. We believe that in the near future, power consumption will be a charging criterion in the cloud computing services. User may pay for the energy used by their workload. Significant opportunities for power optimization exist at application design stage and are not yet fully exploited by application designers. However, it is difficult for developers to measure the energy used by their workload, and to explore how energy use might change with conditions that vary outside of the developer's control to build energy optimization policies. We solve the problem by proposing a function-component-level power model that allows developers to estimate the energy use for their application in function-level. Different from prior hardware-based measurement, we built the power prediction model based on profiling the Performance Monitor Counter, which is easy to deploy in various platforms. We also visualized the power data with call graph of the application and expand eclipse IDE tools with power feature. Experiment results showed that our method is lightweight and easy to use.","","978-0-7695-5157-9","10.1109/CSC.2013.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6693179","Component-level power consumption;function-level power consumption;green application;performance counter","Power demand;Power measurement;Computational modeling;Data models;Hardware;Pins","","1","","12","IEEE","2 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

National Instruments LabVIEW is available to publish data from the development environment to the Web. The student can access the remote laboratory and perform experiments without any limitation of time and location. They can also observe the signals by changing the parameters of the experiment and evaluating the results. During the session, the teacher can watch and communicate with students who perform their experiment. The usefulness of remote laboratory in teaching environments is already known: it saves equipment, personnel for the institution and it saves time and money for the remote students. It also allows the same equipment to be used in research purposes by many teams, through Internet.

It began as software to fill the gaps as industry moved first to client-server and then to multi-tier distributed systems. As monolithic software was broken up and dispersed across servers, it became necessary to reconnect capabilities, manage disparate resources and functions, and access information and functions from remote requesters. This resulted in a host of software offerings for the middle tier. Component Broker is Internet middleware for distributed objects. It is designed to absorb complexity in the operational and development environment so that applications appear to be transparent, local and fully resourced. Component Broker is a complete package, with everything a developer needs to build, run and manage Web-enabled business objects, components and applications.","1941-0131","","10.1109/4236.670683","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=670683","","Internet;Middleware;Application software;Computer architecture;Web server;Logic;Computer industry;Software systems;Resource management;Service oriented architecture","","7","12","","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The technique involves the use of a mobile device in the hands of the student through which he/she can take the examination. Result is displayed immediately after the examination ends. The system is consistent with the current technological advancements in the mobile device design & the wireless technology. The motivation behind the design of the system is to find an alternative to the traditional method of conduct of the examination wherein a lot of head ache is involved for both the students as well as examiners (faculty members). The system is basically an extension of the online examination system. The system has been designed in the Qt SDK, a freeware IDE provided by Forum Nokia.

For that reason, many companies have engaged in taking a further step to update their services to be accessible from these kinds of device as well. However, to absolutely dispose and replace the legacy system in short time seems inappropriate, therefore having cross-platforms applications will be the best solution. With the aim to bring more convenience to the tendering services offered by a construction industry, this paper proposes a cross-platform application development environment adapted Spring framework to secure a connection between two platforms; Android and Windows.

WebGIS, pushed by keeping increasing information resources, enriches functions and content of GIS under WWW framework. We propose a mobile agent-based middleware for WebGIS, called M4WebGIS, which consists of a group of coordinated agents for users to retrieve geographic information. Function logic of server part, processing logic of client part and underlying operation of system, such as interaction with operating system, network, and database, are designed separately in M4WebGIS to achieve stability. Independence between modules ensures extensibility. Moreover, functions such as map management, user management and data management, make M4WebGIS as an integrated middleware system. M4WebGIS offers functions, such as roaming and zooming in several map layers, spatial information analysis and retrieval, database supporting, real-time event tracking, different systems compatibility supporting, and adding spatial characteristics to Web site. Using M4WebGIS, application developers, data distributors and spatial database engine vendors can add dynamic, data-driven map to their applications. M4WebGIS can be integrated into development environment seamlessly, reducing application system complexity, speeding up development progress of applications, alleviating cost and enhancing maintainability as well. In the distributed environment, M4WebGIS achieves pretty parallel computing, balances network workload, acquires exact geographic information and saves network bandwidth.","","978-0-7695-3881-5","10.1109/WCSE.2009.802","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5403278","GIS;WebGIS;middleware;agent;web application","Middleware;Geographic Information Systems;Spatial databases;Information retrieval;Logic design;Information resources;World Wide Web;Network servers;Operating systems;Stability","","3","","16","IEEE","2 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, this experience serves to reinforce design concepts learned in previous courses and requires the students to develop real-world prototypes for implementation. The specific projects focus on designing and developing assistive technologies for disabled individuals employed at not-for-profit agencies. The devices provide the individuals with increased accessibility to employment opportunities. The students employ a variety of design tools including Manhattan, a web-based forum for sharing designs and communication. Recent projects in the area of manual work have included box folding, screw packaging, tape cutting, and folder assembly. The projects are successful in several ways. The students gain valuable interdisciplinary design experience, the not-for-profit agency gains needed assistance in their production, and the individuals with disabilities become more productive employees. This design experience provides a framework for emulating a modern product development environment with participating team members located at different universities around the world.","","978-1-4244-4135-8","10.1109/ICCIE.2009.5223877","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5223877","Design;ABET;Teamwork;Multidisciplinary","International collaboration;Educational institutions;Industrial engineering;Biomedical engineering;Laboratories;Prototypes;Employment;Fasteners;Packaging;Assembly","","1","","4","IEEE","25 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A similar situation can occur in the undergraduate laboratory. Here a student, having designed the software component of a project, can't gain access to the necessary hardware to prepare for or complete a laboratory because of schedule/security difficulties. Over the past year we have overcome this problem by using ""virtual"" hardware, where device operation is simulated in software. We have generalized the approach so that the virtual devices can be used in conjunction with microprocessor simulator software and with actual evaluation boards for both RISC and CISC systems. We are in the preliminary development stages of a new HTML Web page approach where we control, rather than just launch, these commercial simulation packages. Such an approach would provide a controlled, interactive, tutorial environment for students taking microprocessor courses. There are further industrial and academic advantages of such an approach which can help to overcome the initial learning curve for the tools. We discuss the basics of developing ""virtual"" devices for use with the Windows based development environment provided with Software Development Systems 68 K and PowerPC free sample kits. These devices can then be ported to the Motorola M68332EVK and Advanced Micro Devices' SA29200 microprocessor evaluation boards to provide actual hardware experience.","0190-5848","0-7803-3348-9","10.1109/FIE.1996.567813","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=567813","","Tutorial;Hardware;Microprocessors;Laboratories;Computer industry;Industrial control;Software design;Job shop scheduling;Processor scheduling;Security","","","","4","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Methods for the rapid development and distribution of waveform software must be created in order to realize the full potential of a communications system that can change parameters such as waveform, operating frequency, protocols and error correction. There needs to be a standard SDR waveform development process addressing all of the engineering design steps for faster, simpler and more economical waveform development. This paper discusses, and provides clear answers to, the following questions. Why do we want (or need) a waveform development environment (WDE)? Can HW/SW decisions be pushed down to the lowest appropriate decomposition level? Should the language be standardized so that it has the widest potential applicability? Could the environment build upon the latest multimedia developments, so that they could be both more affordable and supportable?

The maintainability criteria considered comprised of modifiability, testability, understandability and portability. We found that the RoR implementation fared better on modifiability, testability, and understandability, while J2EE implementation was the most portable. The results led us to comment on the maintainability of small WAs with respect to underlying architecture and development environments the three platforms provide.

These applications generally demand substantial reduction of communication bandwidth, response latency and power consumption of these Internet-based cyber-physical systems. To tackle these demands for efficient use of communication, computing and power resources, we developed an advanced wearable sensor platform (AWSP) which integrated a powerful system-on-chip (SoC) processor, a smart power management unit, a highly accurate real-time clock and multi-function peripherals into a miniature module. This AWSP designed to function is capable of performing sophisticated data pre-processing including real-time artifact and noise removal, data compression, and even feature extraction before uploading the data to other devices like mobile phone, computer, etc. Furthermore, with the installation of embedded real-time Linux operating system, this sensor provides a familiar and powerful software development environment for system developers to build their computation-intensive real-time applications.

This speeds up developer setup time, brings economies of scale, introduces parity between development and production environments, allows the use of platform-specific tools, and simplifies embedded-system development. Using VMs, testers can ensure a pristine environment and access to diverse (virtual) platforms. Deployment is also simplified by packaging all the system's components and setup into a VM appliance.

Participants are 12 and from 10 countries this year: Turkey, Mexico, Guatemala, Peru, Sri Lanka, Australia, Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt and Vietnam. A microcontroller module called mbed was used for the main computer, as it has online development environment as well as quite a few libraries for users to get used to it rapidly. In the first week, starting with lecture of mbed, three teams built very simple CanSats. The CanSats were launched by model rocket (2m long and goes up to the altitude of 350m) in Kada, Wakayama. Advanced level “come-back” CanSats were built in the rest of the weeks. Unfortunately, those CanSats were not launched due to the earthquake in Japan on 11th March 2011. However, CLTP ended successfully as they all experienced the primary purposes of this program. Instruction material of space education focused on CanSat is now in progress, and it is going to be tailored and translated into the version of respective countries.

Web-based Virtual Meeting Tools (VMT) enable synchronous communication globally through interactive audio, online chats, video, and the sharing of presentations. They provide potentially a cost effective way to train even complex topics to large numbers of people in global settings. Few industrial experiences from the design and use of VMT-based training innovations have been reported. This paper draws upon a case study in a global corporation to describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of a training innovation, consisting of a set of courses delivered by means of a VMT and conference calls, to support the global deployment of a Unified Modeling Language (UML) modeling tool and to develop UML modeling skills. Evaluation is based on interviews to verify 1) the impacts of the innovation on skills, knowledge and motivation, 2) perceived learner satisfaction with respect to the innovation. The innovation proved successful in improving skills, knowledge, and motivation in the case organization and learners were satisfied with it.

Integral to this effort is developing shared understanding surrounding multiple artifacts, each artifact embodying its own model, over the entire development process. This focus on model- oriented collaboration embedded within a larger process is what distinguishes collaboration research in software engineering from broader collaboration research, which tends to address artifact-neutral coordination technologies and toolkits. This article first presents a list of goals for software engineering collaboration, then surveys existing collaboration support tools in software engineering. The survey covers both tools that focus on a single artifact or stage in the development process (requirements support tools, UML collaboration tools), and tools that support the representation and execution of an entire software process. Important collaboration standards are also described. Several possible future directions for collaboration in software engineering are presented, including tight integration between web and desktop development environments, broader participation by customers and end users in the entire development process, capturing argumentation surrounding design rationale, and use of massively multiplayer online (MMO) game technology as a collaboration medium. The article concludes by noting a problem in performing research on collaborative systems, that of assessing how well certain artifacts, models, and embedded processes work, and whether they are better than other approaches.","","0-7695-2829-5","10.1109/FOSE.2007.4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221622","","Collaborative software;Software engineering;Collaborative work;Collaborative tools;Computer science;Software systems;Online Communities/Technical Collaboration;Humans;Convergence;Writing","","172","2","63","IEEE","4 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cloud services and big data approaches may be used to store and analyse this data to improve scalability and availability, which will be required for the billions of devices envisaged in the Internet of Things (IoT). This potential of WSNs is limited by the relatively low number deployed and the difficulties imposed by their heterogeneous nature and limited (or proprietary) development environments and interfaces. This paper proposes a set of requirements for achieving a pervasive, integrated information system of WSNs and associated services. It also presents an architecture which provides a set of abstractions for the different types of sensors and services, enabling them to take advantage of Big Data and cloud technologies and which is termed holistic as it caters for the data flow from sensors through to services.

This paper presents an opposite approach taken from the software developer's viewpoint - an incorporation of the ontology paradigm into a general-purpose programming language, in a simple and agile way, on a small scale, and in an unpretentious manner. The objective is to help programmers write simple domain-driven code with richer semantics. The means to achieve this objective relies on metaprogramming to internalize the ontology modeling paradigm into a mainstream programming environment based on the Java ecosystem, in a lightweight manner suitable for small teams. An embedded meta domain-specific language (DSL), which is called Magic Potion, is implemented in Clojure and blends ontology, functional, object-oriented, and concurrent paradigms.

Users can select and set collaborations patterns between these information portlets to construct applications of information convergence. In phrase of execution, these applications are translated into convergent scripts which are transparent for users and executed by a script engine and convergent results generated by the engine are represented again by a portlet before users.

This paper discusses the benefit of creation of logistically compatible testers. Logistics compatibility is obtained by identifying common test capabilities of current unique testers and consolidating those test requirements into common test resources. Adding to the common test resources is the savings/benefits through the implementation of an evolving Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard which allows multiple sized interface test adapters (ITAs) to work with different ATE. The IEEE-PI 505 receiver-fixture interface2 directly supports a compatible family of testers concept. The paper notes there are several enabling technologies evolving in the industry that facilitate the common instrument approach such as virtual or synthetic instruments (SI), programmable bus emulators or bus simulators. These have the flexibility to consolidate large numbers of obsolete, unique communications cards into a single test equipment asset. This paper also discusses the advances in software technology that will become prevalent in future ATE. Maintenance of test programs can be complicated and costly when using multiple operating systems and multiple test languages. Consolidation of the test language and operating system into an easy-to-use, COTS-based software development environment reduces recurring maintenance and training costs. Network-centric ATE approaches are also considered in this paper with the benefits provided. The use of network and Web-based management of tester software and TPSs is noted as a great benefit in the reduction of software maintenance costs. Use of a network connection and even the Internet allows software and on-line manuals to be managed in one location and provides for automatic updates, guaranteeing the use of the latest official versions of manuals and software. The paper also discusses that Network and Web-based testers allow for information flow in the other direction, thus facilitating a centralized database to collect UUT failure data for tracking repair piece parts and for determining high failure rate issues and/or UUT repair history. The final factor noted in this paper is the use of standards that provide for interfaces that are common and inter-operable across the industry. All the concepts presented form the anatomy of viable future ATE systems. If these concepts are not implemented in ATE designs, we as tax payers will continue to foot the bill for costly band-aid solutions in support of the war fighter.","1558-4550","0-7803-9101-2","10.1109/AUTEST.2005.1609197","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1609197","","Anatomy;Electronic equipment testing;System testing;Instruments;Operating systems;Software testing;Costs;Software maintenance;Life testing;Technology management","","6","1","12","IEEE","27 Mar 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As matter of fact, the service providers turned their old approach create from scratch whatever we need into a new one: look for and integrate. In this brand new scenario, the key role is played by the interoperability: indeed it is required that each time a new service is deployed and once the interfaces are defined, the client does not need any further information to make use of the service. The service oriented architecture (SOA) aims at providing a structure that guarantees the transparency and the interoperability between service providers and service requestors. Even if the SOA is widely diffused, its performances evaluation is still an open problem: due to transparency of the architecture, it is very hard for application/service developers to have quantitative performance evaluation at any development stages. In this context, we will give an answer to the following question: given a newly developed service, built in a closed development environment, how to predict its performance on a hosted service platform (for example in order to choice between two available platforms or to fine tune it in the contest of a large SOA application)? In this paper we propose a technique for semiautomatic building of performance models of Web service platforms, which we model as instantaneous load dependent servers (iLDS): servers whose service time depends on the workload at a given time. The approach we propose, adopts a black box measurement technique, this means that we can just deploy a service, but we have no access to the underlying server platform configuration both for software and hardware layers. The resulting model can be used by final user or service developers to predict the service behaviour respect to a known workload or to compare different web service platforms. The proposed approach was validated on a simple case study and the measurements put in evidence an interesting result about the common behavior of instantaneous load dependent servers, which can be of general use for modeling this class of systems.","","978-1-4244-5918-6","10.1109/CISIS.2010.150","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5447268","iLDS;performance evaluation;web services;performance model","Web services;Service oriented architecture;Predictive models;Performance evaluation;Delay;Application software;Context-aware services;Measurement techniques;Hardware;Software performance","","","","18","IEEE","15 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In contrast, we present here runtime software support for cost-effective countermeasures against hardware timing failures during system operation. We propose a variability-aware OpenMP (VOMP) programming environment, suitable for tightly-coupled shared memory processor clusters, that relies upon modeling across the hardware/software interface. VOMP is implemented as an extension to the OpenMP v3.0 programming model that covers various parallel constructs, including task, sections, and for. Using the notion of work-unit vulnerability (WUV) proposed here, we capture timing errors caused by circuit-level variability as high-level software knowledge. WUV consists of descriptive metadata to characterize the impact of variability on different work-unit types running on various cores. As such, WUV provides a useful abstraction of hardware variability to efficiently allocate a given work-unit to a suitable core for execution. VOMP enables hardware/software collaboration with online variability monitors in hardware and runtime scheduling in software. The hardware provides online per-core characterization of WUV metadata. This metadata is made available by carefully placing key data structures in a shared L1 memory and is used by VOMP schedulerss. Our results show that VOMP greatly reduces the cost of timing error recovery compared to the baseline schedulers of OpenMP, yielding speedup of 3%-36% for tasks, and 26%-49% for sections. Further, VOMP reaches energy saving of 2%-46% and 15%-50% for tasks, and sections, respectively.","2156-3365","","10.1109/JETCAS.2014.2315883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6802431","Cross-layer variability management;OpenMP;processor clusters;recovery;robust system design;scheduling;timing errors;variations","Software;Hardware;Runtime;Synchronization;Robustness;Integrated circuit interconnections","","8","","54","IEEE","18 Apr 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We focus on applying agent technology, together with Web mining technology, to automate a series of product search and selection activities. It is based on a multiagent development platform, namely, iJADE (intelligent Java agent development environment), which supports various e-commerce applications. The framework comprises an automatic facial authentication utility and six other modules, namely, customer requirements definition, a requirement-fuzzification scheme, a fuzzy agents-negotiation scheme, a fuzzy product-selection scheme, a product-defuzzification scheme, and a product-evaluation scheme. A series of experiments were carried out and favorable results were produced in executing the framework.

The effectiveness of a search technique often depends on properties of user queries, the code being searched, and the specific task at hand. Thus, new code search techniques should ideally be evaluated in realistic situations that closely reflect the complexity, purpose of use, and context encountered during actual search sessions. This paper explores what can be learned from using an online paired interleaving approach, originally used for evaluating internet search engines, to comparatively observe and assess the effectiveness of code search tools in the field. We present a case study in which we implemented online paired interleaving for code search, deployed the tool in an IDE for developers at multiple companies, and analyzed results from over 300 user queries during their daily software maintenance tasks. We leveraged the results to direct further improvement of a search technique, redeployed the tool and analyzed results from over 600 queries to validate that an improvement in search was achieved in the field. We also report on the characteristics of user queries collected during the study, which are significantly different than queries currently used in evaluations.","","978-1-4799-3752-3","10.1109/CSMR-WCRE.2014.6747225","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6747225","code search;feature location;online paired interleaving;field studies","Gold;Visualization;Software maintenance;Internet;Search engines;Context","","5","","17","IEEE","27 Feb 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A programming model that has gained a lot of interest in this context is MapReduce, which simplifies processing of large-scale distributed data volumes, usually on top of a distributed file system layer. In this paper we report on a self-configuring adaptive framework for developing and optimizing data-intensive scientific applications on top of Cloud and Grid computing technologies and the Hadoop framework. Our framework relies on a MAPE-K loop, known from autonomic computing, for optimizing the configuration of data-intensive applications at three abstraction layers: the application layer, the MapReduce layer, and the resource layer. By evaluating monitored resources, the framework configures the layers and allocates the resources on a per job basis. The evaluation of configurations relies on historic data and a utility function that ranks different configurations regarding to the arising costs. The optimization framework has been integrated in the Vienna Grid Environment (VGE), a service-oriented application development environment for providing applications on HPC systems, clusters and Clouds as services. An experimental evaluation of our framework has been undertaken with a data-analysis application from the field of molecular systems biology.","1530-2075","978-1-61284-425-1","10.1109/IPDPS.2011.254","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6008900","","Monitoring;Runtime;Systems biology;Distributed databases;Adaptation models;XML","","10","","21","IEEE","1 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The present work introduces MagosCloud Secure, a highly-scalable, opportunistic, declarative, and secure solution constructed on the basis of MagosCloud[1], designed to meet the needs of traditional and e-science application developers. It allows the deployment of a variety of platforms, providing an access control model whereby developers may declaratively state how they wish their data and application resources to be automatically shared with other users. It relies on the concept of `separation of concerns', such that developers need only be concerned with creating their applications, entrusting MagosCloud Secure with the responsibility of providing a secure, highly scalable platform.

This examination of over 150,000 forum message threads has highlighted crucial gaps in the training of practicing engineers, especially in the areas of hardware-software integration, as well as the design and implementation of user interfaces and algorithms. A complementary review of the available online training materials relevant to these topics reveals the need for more systematic support for learning by practicing system engineers.

The library integrates a well-known multi-agent simulator library Swarm, a popular sensor operating system, TinyOS, and a sensor network simulator tool called TOSSIM. The motivation of designing our library is to address difficulties in studying large-scale wireless sensor networks with energy constraints. The library supports the non-linear energy model used in PowerTOSSIMz, but unlike PowerTOSSIMz, which only supports an offline post-processing battery simulation, our library provides an online energy model. Furthermore, the integration with Swarm enables rich features of the Swarm libraries such as run-time probes, pre-defined simulation environments, data collection and analysis tools, powerful random number generators, and graphical user interfaces. We also enhanced TOSSIM so that heterogeneous TinyOS applications can be executed on simulated sensor nodes. Furthermore, the same source codes that run on the simulator can be deployed on actual hardware sensor nodes supporting an easier hardware/software co-design. The resulting simulator library, SWARM-eTOSSIM, provides versatile visualization tools for diagnostic analysis and a development environment for heterogeneous applications with consideration of real-time energy constraints.","1541-0056","978-1-61284-213-4","10.1109/ISADS.2011.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5741291","Wireless Sensor Networks;SWARM;PowerTOSSIMz;TOSSIM;TinyOS 2.x;Online Energy Management;Power-Awareness;Heterogeneous Applications","Wireless sensor networks;Batteries;Libraries;Hardware;Power demand;Real time systems;Energy consumption","","1","","24","IEEE","5 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The internal aspects are seen as contrasts to end user aspects and interface aspects. Internal program documentation is relevant for almost any kind of software. The internal program documentation represents the original as well as the accumulated understanding of the program, which is very difficult to extract from the source program and its modifications over time. Elucidative programming is a documentation technique that was originally inspired by literate programming. As an important difference between the two, elucidative programming does not call for any reorganization of the source programs, as required by literate programming tools. Elucidative programming provides for mutual navigation in between program source files and sections of the documentation. The navigation takes place in an Internet browser applying a two-framed layout. In this paper we investigate the applicability of elucidative programming in a number of areas related to internal program documentation. It is concluded that elucidative programming can solve a number of concrete problems in the areas of program tutorials, frameworks, and program reviews. In addition we see positive impacts of elucidative programming in the area of programming education.","1092-8138","0-7695-1495-2","10.1109/WPC.2002.1021315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1021315","","Documentation;Programming profession;Application software;Navigation;Natural languages;Software libraries;Computer science;Internet;Concrete;Computer science education","","2","","30","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Inscape environment is a specification-based software development environment integrated by the constructive use of formal interface specifications. The purpose of the formal interface specifications and the semantic interconnections is to make explicit the invisible semantic dependencies that result in conventionally-built systems. The important ingredient provided by Inquire in conceptualization, retrieval, selection and use is the set of predicates that describe the semantics of the elements in the interface. These predicates define the abstractions that are germane to the module interface and describe the properties of data objects and the assumptions and results of operations in a module. Use and reuse of components is based on a component's ability to provide needed semantics at a particular point in a system. It is the purpose of Inquire, the browser and predicate-based search mechanism, to aid both the environment and the user in the search for the components that will provide the desired predicates that are required to build and evolve an implementation correctly.<>","1068-3062","0-8186-4100-2","10.1109/KBSE.1993.341192","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=341192","","Software systems;Buildings;Programming;Software maintenance;Mechanical factors;Computer architecture;Computer science;Process design;Object detection","","18","","21","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While a fully, reliable and widely accepted automatic activity-travel diary collection system is yet to be developed, scientists have presented systems that automate parts of an activity-travel diary collection. In the advent of automated systems, it is important to discuss how to analyse the potential of such systems and how to compare different activity-travel diary collection systems. To achieve this objective, this paper introduces a parallel survey design and a comparison framework for collection systems. The framework can be used as a development tool to optimise system design, to report and monitor progress of different system designs, to objectively weigh benefits in decision making, and to automate systematic analysis. In particular, the framework can be used as a comparison tool to reveal the qualitative difference in the data gathered using different collection systems. To achieve this, the framework defines: 1) a number of activity-travel diary measurement entities (trips and triplegs), entity attributes (e.g., trip purpose, origin / destination, etc.), 2) similarity functions between instances of the same entities, and 3) spatial and temporal quality indices to establish a notion of ground truth. The utility of the proposed framework is demonstrated by analysing the results of a trial survey where data is collected via two activity-travel collection systems: a web-based system (PP) and a smartphone-app-based system (MEILI). PP was collected for one day period and MEILI was used for one week period (with one day overlapping). The results show that half of the trips are captured by both systems, while each system roughly captures the same number of trips as the other. The strengths and weaknesses of MEILI are analysed using the framework on the entire week dataset.","","978-9-6331-3142-8","10.1109/MTITS.2015.7223264","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7223264","activity-travel diary collection;comparison of collection methods;ground truth;spatial and temporal quality indices","Global Positioning System;Vehicles;Accuracy;Geometry;System analysis and design","","9","","24","","27 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is supported by various modelling tools but so far no systems can directly execute BPMN models. The business process execution language for Web services (BPEL) on the other hand is a mainly block-structured language supported by several execution platforms. In the current setting, mapping BPMN models to BPEL code is a necessary step towards unified and standards-based business process development environments. It turns out that this mapping is challenging from a scientific viewpoint as BPMN and BPEL represent two fundamentally different classes of languages. Existing methods for mapping BPMN to BPEL impose limitations on the structure of the source model. This paper proposes a technique that overcomes these limitations. Beyond its direct relevance in the context of BPMN and BPEL, this technique addresses difficult problems that arise generally when translating between flow-based languages with parallelism","","0-7695-2669-1","10.1109/ICWS.2006.67","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4032038","","Web services;Humans;Flowcharts;Information technology;Technology management;Proposals;Australia Council;Inspection;Automation;Refining","","89","5","10","IEEE","19 Dec 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This calls for an in depth analysis of the support available to end users for mashup development. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional framework to evaluate existing mashup tools and platforms. The main idea behind this evaluation is to study the state of the art of mashup development from the end-user perspective and critically evaluate the efforts in this regard against a set of criteria to identify the research directions in this field. The idea of evaluation of mashup tools has been tackled through different approaches in past, however, in this research we attempt to synthesize additional concepts regarding mashup development and analyse this area against previously ignored factors, such as support for capturing users' requirements and users' goals. This study also includes platforms that have not yet been covered by previous evaluation studies. The framework presented in this study can be used as a guideline to inform future design of mashup development environments for both academic and industrial research. The results of the study reinforce the need of a more user-oriented approach to deal with the inherent issues of end-user mashup programming. The study concludes with the proposal of use of goals as a guiding mechanism to derive the mashup applications.","","978-1-4673-3049-7","10.1109/SCC.2012.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6274174","Mashup Programming;Mashup Tools Evaluation;End-User Development","Mashups;Programming;Educational institutions;Protocols;Business;Usability","","9","","40","IEEE","23 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It promises reusable and plug-and-playable software system development environments. The component concept is not new and has been perceived in several different ways by software researchers in academics and practitioners in industry.

To reduce energy consumption while keeping high performance, this paper proposes an Energy-Efficient Workload-Aware (EEWA) task scheduler that is comprised of a workload-aware frequency adjuster and a preference-based task-stealing scheduler. Using DVFS, the workload-aware frequency adjuster can properly tune the frequencies of the cores according to the workload information of the tasks collected with online profiling. The preference-based task-stealing scheduler can then effectively balance the workloads among cores by stealing tasks according to a preference list. Experimental results show that EEWA can reduce energy consumption of task-based programs up to 29.8% with a slight performance degradation compared with existing task schedulers.","","978-1-4799-4116-2","10.1109/IPDPSW.2014.75","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6969445","Online Profiling;DVFS;Task Scheduling","Multicore processing;Energy consumption;Time-frequency analysis;Schedules;Processor scheduling;Runtime","","13","","30","IEEE","4 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This brings additional complexity in the system software that has to fit within the constraints of the devices (chiefly memory, stable storage, and power consumption) and hence, new bugs are revealed. How this evolution of smartphones impacts their reliability is a question that has been largely unexplored till now. With the release of open source OSes for hand-held devices, such as, Android (open sourced in October 2008) and Symbian (open sourced in February 2010), we are now in a position to explore the above question. In this paper, we analyze the reported cases of failures of Android and Symbian based on bug reports posted by third-party developers and end users and documentation of bug fixes from Android developers. First, based on 628 developer reports, our study looks into the manifestation of failures in different modules of Android and their characteristics, such as, their persistence and dependence on environment. Next, we analyze similar properties of Symbian bugs based on 153 failure reports. Our study indicates that Development Tools, Web Browsers, and Multimedia applications are most error-prone in both these systems. We further analyze 233 bug fixes for Android and categorized the different types of code modifications required for the fixes. The analysis shows that 77% of errors required minor code changes, with the largest share of these coming from modifications to attribute values and conditions. Our final analysis focuses on the relation between customizability, code complexity, and reliability in Android and Symbian. We find that despite high cyclomatic complexity, the bug densities in Android and Symbian are surprisingly low. However, the support for customizability does impact the reliability of mobile OSes and there are cautionary tales for their further development.","2332-6549","978-1-4244-9056-1","10.1109/ISSRE.2010.45","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635045","smartphone;reliability;root cause;bug fix;customizability","Computer bugs;Mobile communication;Multimedia communication;Libraries;Operating systems;Smart phones","","49","1","22","IEEE","11 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

NET defines a type system and introduces notions such as component, object, and interface, which are building blocks for distributed multi-language component-based applications. As many other component frameworks, .NET mainly focuses on functional interfaces of components. Non-functional aspects of components, such as resource usage (CPU, memory), timing behavior, fault-tolerance, or security requirements are currently not expressed in .NET's component interfaces. We discuss the usage of aspect-oriented programming techniques in context of the .NET framework. We focus on the fault-tolerance aspect and discuss the expression of non-functional component properties (aspects) as C# custom attributes. Our approach uses reflection to generate replicated objects based on settings of a special ""fault-tolerance"" attribute for C# components. We have implemented an aspect-weaver for integration of aspect-code and component-code, which uses the mechanisms of the language-neutral .NET type system. Therefore, our approach is not restricted to the C# language but works for any of the .NET programming languages.","","0-7695-1558-4","10.1109/ISORC.2002.1003711","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1003711","","Fault tolerance;Distributed computing;Timing;Reflection;Computer languages;Computer architecture;Security;Object oriented modeling;Service oriented architecture;Programming environments","","11","2","20","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, most programmers find the ideas of literate programming, as supported by Web-like tools, far too impractical, academic and far-fetched in relation to current programming practices. With elucidative programming, I focus on the best ideas of literate programming.

The Software Concordance editor allows developers to enhance their inline documentation with multimedia objects and hyperlinks, while still supporting advanced program analysis including lexing, parsing and type checking. We motivate the need for environments like the Software Concordance, describe the design and implementation of its program editor, and discuss lessons learned while creating it. The system is based on a uniform, Web compatible document model for both program source code and nonprogram software documents and a corresponding API. Important technical problems addressed by this research include creating a persistent representation of program lexemes that the analysis suite considers to be ephemeral (such as keywords), providing a simple incremental parsing system, and embedding multimedia in source code without disrupting program analysis. Based on insight gained in the process of implementing the document API, a new approach to the design of a more suitable program analysis infrastructure is suggested.","","0-7695-2011-1","10.1109/APSEC.2003.1254369","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254369","","Software maintenance;Trademarks;System testing;Software systems;Java;Maintenance engineering;Software prototyping;Programming environments;Documentation;Multimedia systems","","2","","31","IEEE","8 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Both the process and the platform concept will be demonstrated with innovative ADAS functions in 3 passenger cars, 1 truck and 1 motorcycle. Embedded hardware and software units have been developed for improving electronic horizon band of vehicles by detecting objects in front. Moreover, driver/motorcycle rider awareness is analysed by monitoring his/her actions online. The systems need to be robust and reliable in different environment conditions (night time, rain, etc.). The DESERVE platform distinguishes three layers of intelligence: perception, application and intervention&warning control. The demonstrators will be based on software development tools from Elektrobit (ADTF) and Intempora (RTmaps). These tools are used to create 10 innovative ADAS applications as part of an integral ADAS development platform, following a new design and development process.

Conference and Exhibition 2001","7 Aug 2002","2001","","","488","494","For innovative portable products, Systems on Chips (SoCs) containing several processors, memories and specialised modules are obviously required. Performances but also low-power are main issues in the design of such SoCs. Are these low-power SoCs only constructed with low-power processors, memories and logic blocks? If the latter are unavoidable, many other issues are quite important for low-power SoCs, such as the way to synchronise the communications between processors as well as test procedures, online testing, software design and development tools. This paper is a general framework for the design of low-power SoCs, starting from the system level to the architecture level, assuming that the SoC is mainly based on the re-use of low-power processors, memories and logic peripherals. SoCs with many processors, co-processors, memories and peripherals cannot be synchronised with a single master clock, due to larger and larger wire delays in deep submicron technologies. Several clocking schemes have been proposed, such as GALS (Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous) but also full asynchronous architectures. This paper will present the advantages and disadvantages of these SoC clocking strategies as well as the impacts on low power. For embedded SoCs containing several processors, one has to write several pieces of software for each processor starting typically from a high-level specification using the C/C++ language. In order to tackle this problem, we propose to first transform the original specification by means of a systematic script of platform-independent source code transformations. That is illustrated by applying global loop transformation techniques to identify asynchronous partitions exhibiting little communication and high locality of access characteristics. In a second stage, we explore multiple-instruction multiple-data (MIMD) mapping onto a given (partly) predefined platform using advanced space-time analysis techniques to maintain low data transfer rates while achieving high system throughput. At the SoC level, accurate cost feedback including high-level power estimation is required. From this essential information, energy trade-offs between application sub-modules can for example be used to refine the solution further. In the case of mapping onto programmable cores with a shared memory hierarchy, a final refinement consists in reorganising the data layout for efficient cache utilisation.","1530-1591","0-7695-0993-2","10.1109/DATE.2001.915068","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915068","","Application specific integrated circuits","","7","","33","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Predictable cloud computing","S. J. Mullender","Network Systems Lab at Bell Labs in Antwerp, Belgium",Bell Labs Technical Journal,"29 Apr 2014","2012","17","2","25","39","The standard tools for cloud computing — processor and network virtualization — make it difficult to achieve dependability, both in terms of real time operations and fault tolerance. Virtualization multiplexes virtual resources onto physical ones, typically by time division or statistical multiplexing. Time, in the virtual machine, is therefore as virtual as the machine itself. And fault tolerance is difficult to achieve when redundancy and independent failure in the virtual environment do not necessarily map to those properties in the physical environment. Virtualization adds a level of indirection that creates overhead, and makes it all but impossible to achieve predictable performance. Osprey uses an alternative to virtualization that achieves the same goals of scalability and flexibility but carries neither the overhead of virtualization, nor the restrictions on dependability. The result is a programming environment that achieves most of the compatibility offered by traditional virtualization efforts and provides much better and much more predictable performance. One technique we use is called Library OS, which stems from high-performance computing. The technique consists of linking applications with a library that implements most services normally provided by the operating system, creating an application that can run practically stand alone, or at least with a very minimal operating system. The Library OS approach moves the boundary between application and operating system down to a level where interactions with the operating system consist of sending/receiving messages (e.g., network packets) and scheduling resources (processor, memory, network bandwidth, and device access). These interactions, as we demonstrate, form a relatively weak bond between an application and the particular instance of the operating system on which it runs — one that can be broken and re-established elsewhere. In fact, we make sure this is the case. Legacy applications that cannot be recompiled or relinked can make use of a Library OS server that runs as a tandem process along with the legacy application processes. System calls from the legacy process are catapulted into the Library OS server which executes them. Applications can still migrate, taking their server process along with them. © 2012 Alcatel-Lucent.","1538-7305","","10.1002/bltj.21542","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6768046","","","","2","","","","29 Apr 2014","","","Nokia Bell Labs","Nokia Bell Labs Journal"

In this paper, we present an abstract grid workflow language (AGWL) for describing grid workflow applications at a high level of abstraction. AGWL has been designed such that the user can concentrate on specifying grid applications without dealing with either the complexity of the grid or any specific implementation technology (e.g. Web service). AGWL is an XML-based language which allows a programmer to define a graph of activities that refer mostly to computational tasks. Activities are connected by control and data flow links. A rich set of constructs (compound activities) is provided to simplify the specification of grid workflow applications which includes compound activities such as if, forEach and while loops as well as advanced compound activities including parallel sections, parallel loops and collection iterators. Moreover, AGWL supports a generic high level access mechanism to data repositories. AGWL is the main interface to the ASKALON grid application development environment and has been applied to numerous real world applications. We describe a material science workflow that has been successfully ported to a grid infrastructure based on an AGWL specification. Only a dozen AGWL activities are needed to describe a workflow with several hundred activity instances.","","0-7803-9074-1","10.1109/CCGRID.2005.1558629","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1558629","","Grid computing;Web services;Programming profession;Materials science and technology;Application virtualization;Resource virtualization;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems and applications;Contracts;Instruments","","63","","11","IEEE","19 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Four software engineers were acquired to implement a Web-based system (7698 Locs, 820 hours) for data management in a delivery schedule of eight weeks. Development environment was close to the agile home ground. Collected empirical data is grounded on three basic data points: time, size and defects. Data is organized around five system releases, each which were tested by 17 customer testers. System release defect-density was 1.43 defects/KLOC, team overall productivity 16.90 Locs/hour and rework costs were 9.8% of the total development effort.

Having learned these basic skills, they acquire further specific advanced skills and proceed to design their own mobile robots to compete in contests. The special topics course students' robots must pass examination by five teachers. Blogs and a wiki Web site for recording students' progress and experiences enhance the project's learning outcomes.

Unfortunately, DoDAF and DoD net-centric mandates pose significant challenges to testing and evaluation since DoDAF specifications must be evaluated to see if they meet requirements and objectives, yet they are not expressed in a form that is amenable to such evaluation. DoDAF is the basis for integrated architectures and provides broad levels of specification related to operational, system, and technical views. In our earlier work, we described an approach to support specification of DoDAF architectures within a development environment based on DEVS (discrete event system specification) for semi-automated construction of the needed simulation models. The result is an enhanced system lifecycle development process that includes both development and testing in an integral manner. We also developed automated model generation using XML which paves the way for OVs to become service-providing components in the Web services architecture. In this paper we present the semantic structure for one of the operational view documents OV-6a that would aid the development of these semi-automated models. We will describe how 0V-6a can be structured in a more generalized meta-model framework such that every rule is reducible to meaningful code which is automatedly constructed through natural language processing (NLP) methods and further be reduced to DEVS based models.

Plugin-based design is based on the idea that plugins provide additional functionality extending the capabilities of a core product. While this is often understood as providing services by implementing abstract classes or interfaces defined in the core product, modern plugin-based systems like Eclipse use a much wider definition of service. We propose to consider these services as typed resources and introduce a contract language that can be used to define contracts between plugins providing and consuming services. This language is based on the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) that has a well-defined syntax and semantics.

Meteorological data are distributed to any point of the base using the LAN, which allows distributing data up to a 3.3-km radius from the acquisition point. The acquisition control procedures are also integrated in the same system. A wide range of difficulties have been overcome during the development of the MDDS, including the integration of heterogeneous components, the integrity of the message system, the future extension and scalability of the system, fault tolerance, process concurrency, and the temporary synchronization of all the applications involved. These have been achieved through three steps, namely 1) design of a complete object-oriented model of the system; 2) implementation of this model using a scalable and portable development environment, such as Java; and 3) use of an intercommunication application technology that fits all the system requirements (high level of abstraction and easy to program and to deploy) as the remote method invocation technology from Java. This development is part of a more ambitious project, called LabVir, that is devoted to implement distributed measurements in Spanish oceanographic vessels and in the Antarctic base using Web technology interfaces.

XML processing however can be slow and memory intensive, especially for scientific data, and consequently SOAP has been regarded as an inappropriate protocol for scientific data. Efficiency considerations thus lead to the prevailing practice of separating data from the SOAP control channel. Instead, it is stored in specialized binary formats and transmitted either via attachments or indirectly via a file sharing mechanism, such as GridFTP or HTTP. This separation invariably complicates development due to the multiple libraries and type systems to be handled; furthermore it suffers from performance issues, especially when handling small binary data. As an alternative solution, binary XML provides a highly efficient encoding scheme for binary data in the XML and SOAP messages, and with it we can gain high performance as well as unifying the development environment without unduly impacting the Web service protocol stack. In this paper we present our implementation of a generic SOAP engine that supports both textual XML and binary XML as the encoding scheme of the message.

The dynamics of the digital economy fuelled by the high rate of innovation in digital technologies demand that firms adopt an equally rapid and responsive information systems development model/paradigm to keep pace. With reference to Rapid Applications Development (RAD), this case study considers the degree to which an iterative and participative information systems development process is amenable to being conducted in a virtual manner. Using participatory action research, this paper investigates the potential for deploying a virtual learning environment as a CASE tool for the development of web-based applications. In this instance the final IT artefact is an operational prototype - the A/B Dashboard. We demonstrate that a virtual information systems development environment can successfully support a RAD/DSDM approach, resolving some of the existing problems associated with RAD.","","0-7695-2056-1","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265630","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265630","","Computer aided software engineering;Information systems;Environmental management;Project management;Prototypes;Telephony;Technological innovation;Management information systems;Stability;Strategic planning","","1","","27","IEEE","26 Feb 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The success and change in direction of the World-Wide Web is a clear indication for this. However this success met a largely unprepared communications infrastructure. The Internet as an originally non-profit network did neither offer the security, nor the globally available accounting infrastructure by itself. These problems were addressed in the recent past, but in a seemingly ad-hoc manner. Several different accounting schemes sensible for only certain types of commercial transactions have been developed, which either seem to neglect the problems of scalability, or trade security for efficiency. Finally, some proposals aim at achieving near perfect security at the expense of efficiency, thus rendering those systems to be of no practical use. In contrast, this paper presents a suitably configurable scheme for accounting in a general, widely distributed client/server environment. When developing the protocol, special attention has been paid to make this approach work well in the future setting of high-bandwidth, high-latency internets. The developed protocol has been applied to a large-scale distributed application, a WWW-based software development environment.","","0-7803-3336-5","10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.586137","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=586137","","Protocols;IP networks;Internet;Scalability;Large-scale systems;Application software;Computer networks;Business;Web pages;Proposals","","","","18","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is particularly true and even necessary in a collaborative testing environment which requires greater communication between testers and developers. In this work we introduce a collaborative visual state-based testing methodology for applications developed in Ruby on Rails, a representative of the Workflow and MVC-based web applications development environment. Our methodology permits, in real time, two or more software testers to share, review, and comment on state-based test results of workflows under test. Collaborators can also examine test cases, edit them and initiate testing sessions. In the paper we describe the design of our collaborative testing methodology.","","978-1-4673-6404-1","10.1109/CTS.2013.6567249","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6567249","Workflow;MVC;Visual collaborative testing;state-based testing","Testing;Visualization;Collaboration;GSM;Software;Rails;Real-time systems","","","","31","IEEE","25 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These features impact how GitHub is used and the benefits it provides to teams' development and collaboration. While most of the evidence we have is from GitHub's use in open source software (OSS) projects, GitHub is also used in an increasing number of commercial projects. It is unknown how GitHub supports these projects given that GitHub's workflow model does not intuitively fit the commercial development way of working. In this paper, we report findings from an online survey and interviews with GitHub users on how GitHub is used for collaboration in commercial projects. We found that many commercial projects adopted practices that are more typical of OSS projects including reduced communication, more independent work, and self-organization. We discuss how GitHub's transparency and popular workflow can promote open collaboration, allowing organizations to increase code reuse and promote knowledge sharing across their teams.","1558-1225","978-1-4799-1934-5","10.1109/ICSE.2015.74","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7194607","GitHub;open source;collaboration;coordination;workflow;pull requests;practices;commercial projects","Interviews;Organizations;Software;Encoding;Writing;Collaborative software","","56","1","49","IEEE","17 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In practice, the experiment reported includes an introduction of Telecom Design Environment (TDE) and customisation of it for the local needs of NMP/SP at the Jyvaskyla site. TDE is a Nokia in-house tool, which provides multi-user modelling capabilities and integrates both process modelling and production support. The TDE customisation discussed in the paper is focused in the development of process templates and associated online guidance.

In MPSoC development environment, changes in the hardware architecture can bring in extensive re-partitioning or re-parallelization of the software architecture. Fast and accurate functional simulation and performance estimation techniques are needed to cope with this co-design problem at the early phases of MPSoC design space exploration. The current paper addresses this issue by introducing a framework which combines hybrid simulation, cache simulation and online trace-driven replay techniques to accurately predict performance of programmable elements in an MPSoC environment. The resulting simulation technique can easily cope with the continuous re-organizations of software architectures during an Instruction Set Simulator (ISS) based design process. Experimental results show that this framework can improve system simulation speed by 3-5X on average while achieving accuracy closely comparable to traditional ISSes.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555832","HySim;Hybrid Simulation;MPSoC;Performance Estimation;Address Recovery;Cache Simulation;Cross Replay","Hardware;Predictive models;Computer architecture;Software architecture;Space exploration;Reduced instruction set computing;Digital signal processing;VLIW;Permission;Signal processing","","","","21","","2 Jul 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
