    "abstract": "Teaching programming and computational thinking to young students has gained increasing attention in recent years. This great attention is attributed partially to the emergence of easy-to-use visual programming environments. These environments help students focus on the logic and concepts of programming and at the same time enhance their engagement. It has been shown that the characteristics of visual programming environments influence students’ engagement with programming. However, there is still no systematic investigation of these characteristics. This study aims to provide insights on the characteristics of visual programming environments for K-9 education based on a systematic literature review of 83 empirical studies on K-9 teaching and learning programming. These characteristics are analysed based on the following four levels: a) functional features; b) student experience; c) teacher experience; d) disadvantages. Finally, herein we discuss the features that a programming environment for K-9 education could have to improve the experience of students and teachers.",

    "abstract": "Various development tools have been introduced and the choice of suitable development tool depends on the particular context like the type of application to be developed, the development process and application domain, etc. The real challenge is to deliver new features at the right time with a faster development cycle. The selection of suitable development tools will help developers to save time and effort. In this research, we will explore software engineering repositories (like StackOverflow) to collect feedback from developers about development tools. This will explore which features in a development tool are most important, which features are missing, and which features require changes. The answers to these questions can be found by mining the community question-answering sites (CQA). We will use user feedback to innovate the new features in the development tool. Various techniques of Big Data, Data Mining, Deep Learning, and Transformers including Generative Pre-Training Transformer will be used in our research. Some of the major techniques include (i) data collection from CQA sites like StackOverflow, (ii) data preprocessing (iii) categories the data into various topics using topic modeling (iv) sentiment analysis of data to get positive or negative aspects of features (v) ranking of users and their feedback. The output of this research will categorize the users feedback into various ideas, this will help organizations to decide which features are required, which features are not required, which features are difficult or confusing, and which new features should be introduced into a new release.",

    "abstract": "Electronic Blocks are a new programming interface, designed for children aged between three and eight years. The Electronic Blocks programming environment includes sensor blocks, action blocks and logic blocks. By connecting these blocks children can program structures that interact with the environment. The Electronic Block programming interface design is based on principles of developmentally appropriate practices in early childhood education. As a result the blocks provide young children with a programming environment that allows them to explore quite complex programming principles. The simple syntax of the blocks provides opportunities for young children unavailable through the use of traditional programming languages. The blocks allow children to create and use simple code structures. The Electronic Block environment provides a developmentally appropriate environment for planning overall strategies for solving a problem, breaking a strategy down into manageable units, and systematically determining the weakness of the solution. Electronic Blocks are the physical embodiment of computer programming. They have the unique dynamic and programmable properties of a computer minus its complexity.",

    "abstract": "Large scientific applications developed as recently as five to ten years ago are often at a disadvantage in current computing environments. Due to frequent acquisition decisions made for reasons such as priceperformance, in order to continue production runs it is often necessary to port large scientific applications to completely different architectures than the ones on which they were developed. Since the porting step does not include optimizations necessary for the new architecture, performance often suffers due to various architectural features. The Programming Environment and Training (PET) Computational Environments (CE) team has developed and deployed different procedures and mechanisms for collection of performance data and for profiling and optimizations of these applications based on that data. The paper illustrates some of these procedures and mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Active learning and training is a particularly effective form of education. In various domains, skills are equally important to knowledge. We present an automated learning and skills training system for a database programming environment that promotes procedural knowledge acquisition and skills training. The system provides meaningful knowledge-level feedback such as correction of student solutions and personalized guidance through recommendations. Specifically, we address automated synchronous feedback and recommendations based on personalized performance assessment. At the core of the tutoring system is a pattern-based error classification and correction component that analyzes student input in order to provide immediate feedback and in order to diagnose student weaknesses and suggest further study material. A syntax-driven approach based on grammars and syntax trees provides the solution for a semantic analysis technique. Syntax tree abstractions and comparison techniques based on equivalence rules and pattern matching are specific approaches.",

    "abstract": "Computational thinking (CT) education reaches only a fraction of young children, in part because CT learning tools often require expensive hardware or fluent literacy. Block-based programming environments address these challenges through symbolic graphical interfaces, but users often need instructor support to advance. Alternatively, voice-based tools provide direct instruction on CT concepts but can present memory and navigation challenges to users. In this work, we present Visual StoryCoder, a multimodal tablet application that combines the strengths of each of these approaches to overcome their respective weaknesses. Visual StoryCoder introduces children ages 5–8 to CT through creative storytelling, offers direct instruction via a pedagogical voice agent, and eases use through a block-like graphical interface. In a between-subjects evaluation comparing Visual StoryCoder to a leading block-based programming app for this age group (N = 24), we show that Visual StoryCoder is more understandable to independent learners, leads to higher-quality code after app familiarization, and encourages personally meaningful projects.",

    "abstract": "Jupyter notebooks are widely used in industry and in academic research, but have only begun to make inroads into the classroom. The design of the Jupyter notebook is in many ways well suited for teaching subjects in information technology and computer science, but it is a tool that departs significantly from a standard text editor or integrated development environment, and thus carries with it several unique advantages as well as several surprising potential pitfalls. As use of Jupyter notebooks has grown, so has criticism of the notebook, for varied reasons: notebooks can behave in unexpected ways, they can be difficult to reproduce, they open up potential security issues, and they may encourage poor coding practices. A set of best practices to guide instructors and help addressing these concerns when using Jupyter notebooks in the classroom is currently lacking. This paper addresses the strengths and weaknesses of the Jupyter notebook for education, drawing on existing literature as well as the author’s experience teaching a range of courses with Jupyter notebooks for over five years, and recommends a set of best practices for teaching with the Jupyter notebook.",

    "abstract": "Originally developed by James McCartney in 1996 and now an open source project, SuperCollider is a software package for the synthesis and control of audio in real time. Currently, it represents the state of the art in the field of audio programming: there is no other software available that is equally powerful, efficient or flexible. Yet, SuperCollider is often approached with suspicion or awe by novices, but why? One of the main reasons is the use of a textual user interface. Furthermore, like most software packages that deal with audio, SuperCollider prerequisites a series of skills, ranging from expertise in analog/digital signal processing, to musical composition, to computer science. However, as the beginner overcomes these initial obstacles and understands the powerful flexibility of SuperCollider, what once were seen as weaknesses become its strengths. SuperCollider’s features also mean versatility in advanced software applications, generality in terms of computer modelling, and expressivity in terms of symbolic representations. This book aims at providing a brief overview of, and an introduction to, the SuperCollider programming environment. It also intends to informally present, by employing SuperCollider, a series of key notions relevant to what is broadly referred to as computer music. Andrea Valle is a researcher/aggregate professor in film, photography and television at the University of Turin-DAMS, and is active as a musician and composer. He has been a SuperCollider user since 2005.",

    "abstract": "Multi-FPGA systems offer the potential to deliver higher performance solutions than traditional computers for some low-level computing tasks. This requires a flexible hardware substrate and an automated mapping system. CHAMPION is an automated mapping system for implementing image processing applications in multi-FPGA systems under development at the University of Tennessee. CHAMPION will map applications in the Khoros Cantata graphical programming environment to hardware. The work described in this dissertation involves the automation of the CHAMPION back-end design flow, which includes the partitioning problem, netlist to structural VHDL conversion, synthesis and placement and routing, and host code generation. The primary goal is to investigate the development and evaluation of three different k-way partitioning approaches. In the first and the second approaches, we discuss the development and implementation of two existing algorithms. The first approach is a hierarchical partitioning method based on topological ordering (HP). The second approach is a recursive algorithm based on the Fiduccia and Mattheyses bipartitioning heuristic (RP). We extend these algorithms to handle the multiple constraints imposed by adaptive computing systems. We also introduce a new recursive partitioning method based on topological ordering and levelization (RPL). In addition to handling the partitioning constraints, the new approach efficiently addresses the problem of minimizing the number of FPGAs used and the amount of computation, thereby overcoming some of the weaknesses of the HP and RP algorithms.",

    "abstract": "As Information and Communication Technology (ICT) literacy education has recently shifted to fostering computing thinking ability as well as ICT use, many countries are conducting research on national curriculum and evaluation. In this study, we measured Korean students’ ICT literacy levels by using the national measurement tool that assesses abilities of the IT (Information Technology) area and the CT (Computational Thinking) area. A research team revised an existing ICT literacy assessment tool for the IT test and developed a new CT test environment in which students could perform actual coding through a web-based programming tool such as Scratch. Additionally, after assessing ICT literacy levels, differences in ICT literacy levels by gender and grade were analyzed to provide evidence for national education policies. Approximately 23,000 elementary and middle school students participated in the 2018 national assessment of ICT literacy, accounting for 1",

    "abstract": "Informatics education, not only in higher but also in secondary education, is often assisted by special learning software to teach the fundamental ideas of algorithms [2]. In this context pupils also learn the basics of programming using didactically reduced, textbased or visual programming languages. Therefore in Germany, in some federal countries (for example Bavaria), where the basics of algorithms are already taught in the 7th grade (age 12 to 13 years), age-based learning and programming environments, such as Karel, the robot and Kara, the programmable ladybug [1], are used. Although the design of these environments is age-based, working with them to solve algorithmic problems often causes problems in the classroom. These tools give feedback to the learners based on the analysis of a current solution attempt without taking the previous problem solving process into account. The system messages are often rather technical and therefore hardly helpful especially for weaker learners to enable them to correct arisen problems by themselves. In order to give optimal support to pupils in these situations and therefore improve the learning processes, the learner-system interaction of the used educational software environments should be enhanced and better be adapted to the learners? individual problem solving strategies.The main objective of this research project is to find out, to what extent the automated diagnosis of a problem solving strategy of a learner is possible, and to what extent this knowledge can be used to enhance the learner-system interaction. Starting from the advantages and disadvantages of standardized process observation methods, two software-based research instruments for the system supported diagnosis of the individual proceedings, using the learning environment Kara, were designed and implemented. With the first component learner-system interactions are recorded, the second one provides functions to analyse the collected data. Using test-cases gives a first idea of the quality of the solution attempts.The requirements for the software components resulted from several test scenarios with a small number of participants with different qualification in computer science (from novices to graduating computer science students). During these tests each individual was observed by a researcher and additionally interviewed afterwards. A first version of the implemented instruments was tested in case studies with more than 100 participants (12 to 13 years old) from Bavarian grammar schools to evaluate the suitability for daily use. During the studies the learners were asked to solve three given tasks in a session of 45 minutes, provided by the Kara system, individually (one pupil per computer), but communication between the test persons was allowed. The tasks required knowledge of the control structures (sequence, selection, iteration).The results of these studies indicate that it is possible to identify and to evaluate different problem solving patterns with the help of the developed instruments. To identify different types of learners? strategies it is necessary to combine the various kinds of visualizations of the collected data. To support automatic categorization pattern-recognition methods will be used. The collected ordinal (test-case results) and nominal data can be used for analyses of the correlation between different factors (for example number of error messages or program executions compared with the assessment of the solution attempt) with methods of descriptive statistics.",

    "abstract": "Scratch is a visual, block-based programming language, adopted as a computational thinking development tool in elementary education among many countries. Thailand has also recently included Scratch as part of the computing science course in its basic education. However, Thailand is facing a shortage of ICT teachers who are skillful in Scratch programming, especially in small provincial schools. This research aims to overcome the shortage by developing ScratchThAI, a Scratch tutorial chatbot. It is designed to assist young learners directly through a messaging platform. By giving supports through a textual conversation, more relevant advice, knowledge, and resources could be provided precisely. Different levels of each computational thinking concept are extracted and evaluated by the designed assessment algorithm. Extra predefined exercises are assigned based on the analyzed learner’s strengths and weaknesses in order to actively improving the learner’s understanding. Moreover, gamification is incorporated to engage and motivate young learners in computational thinking development.",

Analog Device’s Black-fin processor was chosen based mostly on cost, but also on performance, development environment, and documentation.We first present our goals in the class. We then give an overview of the Blackfin architecture and how the Blackfin fits in with many of our goals. We then present the implementation of an expansion board developed to interface with Blackfin’s EZ-KIT Lite board.We present our experiences with this setup in the hopes that others who might be thinking of a similar curricular change can learn from our successes and failures. We outline the strengths and weaknesses of the Blackfin architecture as an educational platform, followed by a discussion of our experiences and a presentation of the support materials we developed to accompany the course, including lecture material and laboratories. Finally, we discuss our future directions for our uses with the board.",

    "abstract": "In the current situation of the development of science and technology, virtual technology arises at the historic moment. As a kind of computer simulation technology, it has the simulation ahead of the real world. Because of its many advantages, virtual technology is already being used in fields such as education and medicine. However, there are still some shortcomings in the current virtual technology. Although the development tools are equipped, there are still some disadvantages in the process of using them, which hinders the developers to improve their work efficiency significantly. Among the prospects, this technology is the most widely used in education, and this paper aims to develop a virtual reality application engine that is convenient for party school teaching. In the education and learning of the party school, the design and r&amp;d of VR products should be completed under the support of the model and theory of education, and should respond to the characteristics of the discipline. This paper expounds a series of processes from design to r&amp;d of VR products. At the beginning, I analyses the subject and investigated the market prospect of VR education, so as to get a product with the same learning efficiency and teaching efficiency. Secondly, the depth plane analysis is carried out on the mathematical knowledge needed in the construction of 3d model, and the emphasis is put on the introduction of quaternions, transformation matrix, homogeneous coordinates and the functions of these knowledge in 3d application.",

    "abstract": "While parallel computing offers an attractive perspective for the future, developing efficient parallel applications today is a labor-intensive process that requires an intimate knowledge of the machines, the applications, and many subtle machine-application interactions. Optimizing applications so that they can achieve their full potential on parallel machines is often beyond the programmer’s or the compiler’s ability; furthermore its complexity will not be reduced with the increasingly complex computer architectures of the foreseeable future. In this dissertation, we discuss how application performance can be optimized systematically. We show how insights regarding machine-application pairs and the weaknesses in their delivered performance can be derived by characterizing the machine, the application, and the machine-application interactions. We describe a general performance tuning scheme that can be used for selecting and applying a broad range of performance tuning actions to solve major performance problems in a structured sequence of steps, and discuss the interrelationship among and between performance problems and performance tuning actions. To guide programmers in performance tuning, we developed a goal-directed performance tuning methodology that employs hierarchical performance bounds to characterize the delivered performance quantitatively and explain where potential performance is lost. To reduce the complexity of performance tuning, we developed an innovative performance modeling scheme to quickly derive machine-application interactions from abstract representations of the machine and application of interest.Collectively, this dissertation unifies a range of research work done within the Parallel Performance Project at the University of Michigan over the past seven years and significantly improves the state-of-the-art in parallel application development environments.",

    "abstract": "The concept of edutainment or \"education and entertainment\" is not new in a learning environment and its purpose is to make the learning process more enjoyable. This project integrated mobile game technology into a Mobile Learning system to make the learning process more fun and effective for its student end-users. The current generation prefers to spend time in front of the computer playing games instead of studying, so the project merged the technology so they can still play games but study at the same time. Even though mobile technology has many weaknesses (e.g., limited screen size), the project used this technology because it can be played anywhere, anytime, by any mobile device. The main end-users of the project are students or anyone who is learning the subject. For the time being, the project focuses on C++ programming as its domain. Basically, once a student executes the application, he or she can play the game by using C++ programming knowledge. The game starts by displaying a question. The player is represented by a small car that can shoot by using bullets. Within a time limit, the player must shoot the correct answer to a practical programming question. If the player shoots the wrong answer, the wrong answer will try to shoot the player back. The game was developed using J2ME as its development tool and Adobe Photoshop as its graphic design tool.",

    "abstract": "The training of raters is one practical way for enhancing the accuracy of performance ratings. Traditional methods for presenting the training, such as lecture, group discussion, and practice/feedback, are subject to certain weaknesses. A new ICART training method, which is an application of knowledge-based systems, was suggested to overcome the weaknesses of these traditional training methods. The objectives of this study were three-fold: (1) preparing a proposal for training raters, (2) developing the ICART system according to proposal guidelines, and (3) examining whether the developed ICART system may improve the accuracy of performance ratings.The fault tree analysis technique was used to effectively define the training content. During this analysis of the problem domain, biases that occurred in judgmental activities were considered as rating-error sources. Based on a questionnaire survey and factor analysis, relationships between rating errors and error sources were explored. The results of the fault tree analysis defined the scope and the order of training tasks.Based on the defined training content, the ICART system was developed as a prototype in accordance with formalities of intelligent tutoring systems. The system was composed of three functional modules: a domain-expert knowledge module, a teaching knowledge module, and a user-interface module. Production systems and hypertext techniques were utilized to represent knowledge for the modules in the system. The Exsys Professional shell was used as a development tool.The developed ICART system was tested in the situation of evaluating an individual performing a briefing. A total of twenty-eight ROTC cadets participated in two scheduled training sessions. The control group was trained by the traditional lecture and practice method; the experimental group was trained by interacting with the ICART system. Five accuracy components, elevation, differential elevation, stereotype accuracy, differential accuracy, and overall accuracy, were used as dependent variables for analyzing training effects. It was found that training by the ICART system improved accuracy components of differential elevation and overall accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Training and development are necessary components to insure the success of small businesses in the changing global economy. Previous small- and medium-size enterprise (SME) research has shown that the owners and employees of small businesses receive less formal education than employees at larger firms due to high costs, inconvenient locations, inflexible schedules, lack of human resources, and owner attitudes. Technology and the advancement of internet-based learning may be a solution to many of these potential barriers. This descriptive study examines the current adoption and attitudes towards the Internet as a formal and informal training and development tool by small tourism and hospitality businesses (STHB) in Northern Norway. The study provides an introduction to SMEs and the attitudes and barriers they face in pursuing training, the advantages and disadvantages of internet-based training and a discussion of formal versus informal training methods followed by a description of the methodology and results. For this study a web-based survey link was e-mailed to 615 STHBs in Northern Norway in June and July 2008. The findings of this research have significance in the context of STHBs in Northern Norway, but given the low response rate of 24.2",

A key advantage of a library-based approach is that it can be deployed without requiring any change in the tool chain, including compilers and IDEs. However, the use of library APIs to express all aspects of task parallelism can lead to code that is hard to understand and modify. A key advantage of a language-based approach is that the intent of the programmer is easier to express and understand, both by other programmers and by program analysis tools. However, a language-based approach usually requires the standardization of new constructs and (possibly) of new keywords. In this paper, we compare the java.util.concurrent (j.u.c) library [14] from Java 7 and the Habanero-Java (HJ) [16] language, supported by our experiences in teaching both models at Rice University.",

    "abstract": "Software testing is an integral part of the software development process. Some software developers, particularly those who use the Extreme Programming test-driven development practice, continuously write automated tests to verify their code. We present a tool to complement the feedback loops created by continuous testing. The tool combines static source code metrics with dynamic test coverage for use throughout the development phase to predict a reliability estimate based on a linear combination of these values. Implemented as an open source plug-in to the Eclipse IDE, the tool facilitates the rapid transition between unit test case completions and testing feedback. The color-coded results highlight inadequate testing efforts as well as weaknesses in overall program structure.

    "abstract": "From the Book: This book will provide you with a thorough understanding of Director. It also focuses on the dramatic new flood of Xtras and XObjects that, thanks to Macromedia’s Open Architecture (MOA), may well elevate Director to the lofty status of a true application development environment that goes far beyond C++. The long heralded 5GL (fifth generation language) that was hype ten years ago is today’s Director. Where will it go How high will it fly You’ll never know unless you’ve been there! Mastering Macromedia Director 5 and the accompanying Directions CD-ROM will guide you on your first steps down a path toward becoming a player in the media revolution. You can use this book and CD-ROM to start preparing for the big changes that will undoubtedly rock our culture and challenge our perceptions about media before we ring out the millennium. Why This Book This book is intended for the quick learner. Someone who can seize Director as the opportunity of a lifetime and run with it. As difficult as Director and Lingo (Director’s companion scripting language) can be at times, Director is nevertheless the quickest route to professional quality and highly creative multimedia authoring. I have endeavored to write a companion text to Macromedia’s own documentation. A book that would provide an additional perspective to concepts and procedures that might otherwise be unnecessarily complicated. I have also attempted to write a book that, once basic concepts were thoroughly understood, could metamorphose into a quick-reference tool. In short, I have tried to write a book for myself. A book that you can pick up, thumb through to a specific section, andquickly get that, \"Oh yeah, I remember how you do that!\" feeling. The fast changing nature of software in general, and Internet and multimedia applications specifically, doom any printed work on the subject to almost instant obsolescence. For this reason, I have attempted to include those subjects and concepts- Director, Lingo, and Shockwave (Director for the Internet) that will have enduring value. Nevertheless, I implore you to use this book only as a starting point. Learn to prowl the Internet for the latest and most compelling new techniques and extensions that allow you to get the most out of Director, for therein lies the future of the multimedia industry and, if you so choose, a career in multimedia application development.

How This Book Is Organized This book has 22 chapters divided into four parts. An appendix is also included. The book begins with a discourse on what we may well back on as the greatest media revolution in all of history, what I have called the multimedia/Internet revolution. This epic change in the way we communicate, entertain, educate, and play might well compete with reality itself, and lead to unimagined worlds that are limited, not by technology, but by our imaginations.\"Part 1: The Essentials of Director\" (Chapters 1-10) continues by presenting an all encompassing overview of the premiere multimedia author tool, Director. Tutorials, demonstrations, and straightforward discussions lead you through the first ten chapters.\"Part 2: The Linguistics of Lingo\" (Chapters 11-16) transports readers to the world of Director’s embedded scripting language, Lingo. Once you have mastered Lingo-from controlling objects to becoming intimate with the elements of Lingo style-you have mastered Director.\"Part 3: Putting It All Together\" (Chapters 17-20) combines every aspect of Director you have learned throughout the first 16 chapters and demonstrates how you can use all these elements to create multimedia products. You will also explore Director’s Internet version called Shockwave.\"Part 4: Xtras\" (Chapters 21-22) is over 200 pages dedicated entirely to revealing dozens of new third-party extensions to Director called Xtras and their still valid predecessors, XObjects.Finally, Appendix A is an extensive listing of Lingo Command References.Mastering Macromedia Director 5uses various conventions to help you find the information you need quickly and effortlessly. Tips, Notes, and Warnings are placed strategically throughout the book to help you focus in on important information quickly. Long but important or interesting digressions are set aside as boxed text, called sidebars. Because building any multimedia product-whether it is for CD-ROM distribution or for Internet/Intranet distribution - must be capable ( running on both Microsoft’s Windows 95 and NT (Windows), an Apple’s Macintosh Operating System (MacOS), I have tailored the book to cross-platforrn developers. In situations where significant differences in the two systems can be found, there will be notes and side bars that draw the distinction. Throughout the book I have used the following generalized conventions to distinguish between Macintosh, Power Mac, Power Mac Clones, Windows 95, and Windows NT:MacOS refers to any machine running under the Apple Macintosh Operating System. Except where noted, there is no difference between the Power PC compatible versions and 680x0 versions of the MacOSWindows refers to any machine running under the Microsoft Windows 95 and NT operating systems. Except where noted, there is no difference ( (from the standpoint of the Director author) between Windows 95 and Windows NT. References to Windows 3.1 have, for the most part, not been included. About the CD-ROM Inside the back cover of this book you will find the Directions CD-ROM. This disc contains cross-platform versions of all the tutorials and examples of techniques and Lingo code used throughout the book You will also find a save-disabled version of Director 5.0 (for both the MacOS and Windows) and save-disabled versions of many other Macromedia multimedia tools for both the MacOS and Windows. The save-disabled version of Director will allow you to open and experiment with all the tutorials and demonstration Director movies on the CD-ROM. The only drawback is you won’t be able to save any of your changes. Finally, we have endeavored to include as many demonstrations of Xtras and XObjects as possible. Open these demonstrations using the save-disabled version of Director and test drive these Xtras before you purchase them.Good luck! And remember to experiment, and then experiment some more. It’s only through actually trying the processes and techniques described herein that you will discover the multimedia modalities that work for you. Ultimately, you must become your own teacher.",

    "abstract": "Formal methods are a class of techniques for automatically verifying software correctness. They are a common topic in computer science research. However, they are less well-known in software development and in undergraduate computer science education. As society’s reliance on software increases so does the potential severity of the consequences of software failure. Formal methods are the surest way of guaranteeing software correctness. Moreover, the study of formal methods leads to better informal understanding of software correctness and thus to better software. Unfortunately, the study and use of formal methods can be difficult and this impedes their adoption in software engineering and the computer science curriculum. Coq is an automated proof-assistant for developing certified programs and proofs. It is powerful and expressive and has been used in a large variety of significant developments. Experienced developers are accustomed to picking up new languages rapidly. Unfortunately, it is difficult for a new user to learn the use of any proof-assistant with anything like the same rapidity. Furthermore, developers have become accustomed to sophisticated IDEs with tools for refactoring and for auto-generating code. Very little such support is available for proof-assistants. Coq suffers from both these drawbacks. Our work addresses these problems in several ways. We provide two alternative approaches that facilitate general induction and recursion. We demonstrate methods for enhancing structural recursion principles to increase their generality and transparency. We demonstrate graphical techniques for improved proof visualization and an impact analysis tool for predicting the consequences of a proof refactoring.",

    "abstract": "From the Book: Purpose of this Book The convenor of the OOSIG (object-oriented Special Interest Group) of the Australian Computer Society is occasionally referred to as Chairperson. For past two years, this honorary and honourable title has been conferred upon me and, as the title suggests, it provides me with — amongst other things — the unenviable job of moving and organising chairs before the monthly meeting starts and ensuring they are stacked back against the wall after the meeting in the societys office is over. Getting the flipcharts and whiteboard ready, booking the room, sending the invitations, organising coffee and keeping the data projector light bulb from blowing up are some things keep the adrenaline level of the chairperson always on high. However, I had no such challenges to face when Canada-based Bran Selic, kindly addressed my SIG. Many members turned up to listen to one of the original contributors to the Unified Modelling Languages meta-model, particularly to the behind-the-scene stories. One of the interesting features of Brans talk was the candid highlighting of the strengths and weaknesses of the UML. Couple of reasons for UMLs popularity, as emerged during the talk were: UML is a standard and therefore accepted within the larger IT community, and UML came on the IT scene at the right time. The UML fills the void that existed in software development — a modelling mechanism that enables capture and expression of requirements, documentation of design, facilitates architectural discussion and supports software implementation. The modelling capabilities of the UML, supported by CASE tools, are widely usedin numerous practical software projects. Further, professional training courses on business analysis, architecture, design and testing are routinely based on the UML standard. The UML is also popular in the academic world as many university courses use the standard notations and diagrams of the UML to teach the students principles of software engineering. Finally, through relatively less-technical and more business-focused works, object technology and the UML have shown to be capable of being used in non-software related work, such as modelling business processes (BPR), business workflows, and even software workflows. Despite its popularity, however, the UML literature still needs discussion on and application of quality with UML. While we have some excellent literature on the processes of software development it seems to fall short of separate and detailed discussions on quality. On the other hand, works like Binders focus on the technical aspects of testing, using the UML notations, do not provide the process-aspect of improving the quality of software development. Indeed, none of this literature deserves any criticism for the lack of quality discussion — because these literary works do not purport to be discussing quality. The focus of these respectable and popular works is either development or testing. This book is written with an aim of directly addressing the paucity of literature in the area of process quality assurance for UML-based projects. Good Quality is all about satisfying the needs of the user. However, good is a highly subjective term. The reference-point against which quality is judged depends on time, place, and situation — all of which can change! Hence, the essential ingredients in producing good quality are: A product that satisfies the changing needs of the user A process that enables creation, verification and validation of such a product A common mechanism to establish communication Continuous improvement of the process of producing product When applied to software development, these quality requirements translate into producing a software product that would evolve, scale and change, according to the needs of its users — primarily the business. Not only do we need a process for developing such a software product, we also need significant checking and crosschecking of the models and processes that have built the software product. There is a need to ensure the syntactical correctness, semantic consistency and aesthetic symmetry in the models that will be used to produce good quality software. There is also a need to create, follow and check all necessary process steps in order to achieve maturity of processes that will result in good quality software products. Furthermore, these process steps must be executed iteratively, incrementally and sufficiently. Process steps should also be malleable enough to suit various development environments, and various types and sizes of projects. The specific and significant areas of quality related work required in a process incorporating the UML are addressed in this book. The quality techniques discussed in this book include how to organize the overall quality function, the process steps to be followed in creation of UML diagrams, the steps in verification and validation of these diagrams, when to conduct such verificat how the interpret the results of quality activities, who should create and validate the UML diagrams, and how to create a quality control (testing) strategy. Because of the process focus in this book, the techniques of creation of UML diagrams is assumed to be known to the readers. Summary of the Book This book is divided into 6 chapters as summarized below. Chapter 1: The Quality Game In this background chapter on quality assurance we discuss the elusive nature of quality in the context of software. Modelling, particularly with the UML, is shown as means to improve communication and quality and is conducted in the three distinct yet related modelling spaces of Problem, Solution and Background. Process is discussed in the context of its three dimensions of technology (what), methodology (how) and sociology (who). This is followed by discussion on the various checks (syntax, semantics and aesthetics) needed to validate and verify UML-based models and the checks of necessity, sufficiency and malleability needed for a good quality process. Organization of the quality function, and its application to various types of projects (development, integration, package implementation, outsourcing, data warehousing, and educational) as well as various sizes (small, medium, large) of projects are also discussed here. Chapter 2: Quality Environment: Managing the Quality function Process aspect of quality encompasses the management functions of creating and managing a quality environment. This is because software quality is not just verifying and validating what has been produced but also a sustained effort at following the discipline of producing models and software. This discipline encompasses the process or the steps involved in producing good models and good software. This part of this book comprehensively considers organization and execution of the quality function with detailed emphasis on the process of developing UML based software. In other words we discuss how the quality function is organized and carried out in UML-based projects. The people issues (who) is also given due relevance in this part of the book. Chapter 3: Quality Process Architecture This chapter discusses what constitutes such a process, and how it will be helpful in enhancing quality in a UML-based project. This chapter does not propose a new process, but discusses a most generic Process including the Technological, Methodological and Sociological dimensions — what constitutes a process, and what are its major dimensions of a process is described here. The technological dimension of a process deal with the what, the methodological dimension with the how and the sociological dimension with the who, of an overall process. These dimensions are described with common workday examples. Furthermore, the generic process also describes the most commonly used activities and tasks that should be there in any process. These activities and tasks, and the related roles and deliverables, are described with the aim of improving the discipline in a process, resulting in enhanced quality of UML-based deliverables and eventually the software product. Chapter 4: Enacting the Quality Software Process In this chapter we discuss the enactment of an example process including practical issues of configuring an iterative, incremental and parallel project plan, based on the process-components discussed in the previous chapter, are discussed here. We also discuss practical issues of tracking the progress of a project as well as modifying the project plan based on that tracking. An iterative and incremental project plan will facilitate better absorption of changes than a sequential project plan. Creation and management of such a changing plan, derived from the malleability aspect of the process, are also discussed here. This chapter discusses what happens when the rubber hits the road in terms of application of a process. Chapter 5: Estimates and Metrics for UML-based Projects This chapter discusses the important issues of measurements and estimates in UML-based software projects. Starting with an argument for the need to make good estimates, and how good metrics help in making good estimates, this chapter delves into the importance of these measures and estimates in improving the quality of models and processes in the project. Technical measures related to sizes and complexities of the UML artefacts and diagrams is also discussed. Estimates for the example implementation project using the UML are shown with a view to demonstrate the application and significance of metrics in a practical project. Chapter 6: Testing the product This chapter will discuss in detail the quality control and testing aspect of a quality lifecycle. While we discussed process quality in previous chapters, quality control, or testing, is a major process-component dedicated to verifying and validating the results of our efforts thus far in creating models and following a process. Good quality control is inherently negative as it is aimed at breaking everything in a system — its logic, its execution, its performance. Thus, although Quality control is an integral part of quality assurance, but is not synonymous with it. This separation is given its due importance in this separate part of this book. CD &amp; Potential Web Support The CD contains details of the chapters, diagrams, and a set of templates that can be customised for use in projects. Suggested metrics for improving quality (e.g. size of use cases, effort in creating classes) are also incorporated in the CD. Evaluation copies of relevant process tools that deal with quality process have also been provided, with permissions. Literary Audience There are a large number of books written on UML and similarly on processes. Their scope encompasses both academic research and practical applications. This book attempts to synergies the application of quality processes in UML-based projects. With the process focus, the reader is expected to be familiar with UML and its modelling techniques as the book does not purport to discuss the modelling techniques of the UML. However, a person responsible for quality assurance will find this work self-sufficient and may even be encouraged after reading this material to extend their understanding further in to UML. Semantics This author firmly believes in gender-neuter language. Person is therefore used wherever possible. However, in order to maintain simplicity of reading he has been used as freely, and has been balanced by equal, if not more, use of she. Terms like programmer and quality manager, unless otherwise mentioned, represent roles performed by actors. These terms dont tie down real people like you and me who, in a short span of time, can jump from the role of a programmer to a quality manager to a director and back. It is also recognised that people may be playing more than one role at a time. For example, a business analyst may also be a part-time academic or a researcher. We throughout the text primarily refers to the reader and the author — you and me. Occasionally, we refers to the general IT community of which the author is a member. We also refers to the teams in which the author has worked. Therefore, although this is a single author book, you may encounter we as a reference by the author to himself, as well as to the IT community. Real conversations, as you and I are having through this work, cannot be statically typed. Mapping to a Workshop The practical aspects of UML and Quality, displayed in this book, have been popular in seminars and conferences. Amongst many presentation, particular noteworthy are its acceptance as a tutorial at the UML2001 conference in Toronto, Canada and the two-day seminar series in Mumbai, Bangalore and Delhi, in India. Here is a generic outline of the two-day workshop based on this book. For the education and academic community, each chapter in this book can correspond to a 3-hour lecture topic, with earlier part of the semester used in simply creating the UML-based models based on the case study. Acknowledgements Encouragement and support can take various forms —a word of encouragement here, hint of a smile there! And then there are those detailed discussions and arguments with honest reviewers of the manuscript on what should be included and how it should be presented. This is interspersed with the arduous task of typing sections of the manuscript, drawing the figures and the rather trying job of proofreading someone elses writing. All this has come to me through many wonderful people whom I acknowledge here gratefully: Anurag Agarwal Rajeev Arora Craig Bates Paul Becker Christopher Biltoft Bhargav Bhatt Graham Churchley Kamlesh Chaudhary Sandra Cormack Joanne Curry Sanjeev Dandekar Edward DSouza Con DiMeglio Julian Edwards Nandu Gangal Athula Ginige David Glanville Mark Glikson Nitin Gupta Brian Henderson-Sellers Murray Heke Ivar Jacobson Sudhir Joshi Ashish Kumar Vijay Khandelwal Akshay Kriplani Yi-chen Lan Chinar &amp; Girish Mamdapur Javed Matin Sid Mishra Rahul Mohod Navyug Mohnot Narayana Munagala Karin Ovari Les Parcell Chris Payne Andrew Powell Abhay Pradhan Amit Pradhan Anand Pradhan Prabhat Pradhan Rajesh Pradhan Tim Redrup Tracey Reeve Prashant Risbud James Ross Magdy Serour Bran Selic Ashish Shah Paresh Shah Prince &amp; Nithya Soundararajan Pinku Talati Amit Tiwary Murat Tanik Asha Unhelkar Sunil Vadnerkar Suresh Velgapudi John Warner Houman Younessi Paul Becker, my editor at Addison-Wesley, has provided invaluable support in this work and deserves special recognition. Bearing with my delayed submissions, passing encouraging comments when the progress was slow and accommodating my changes up to the last minute are some of the traits of this considerate editor that are gratefully acknowledged. Finally, my family makes all this possible by just being around me even, and especially, when I am mentally lost. I am grateful to my wife Asha, my daughter Sonki Priyadarshini whose view on quality took a jagged turn as she stepped into her teens, my son Keshav Raja who can appreciate quality in cars, bikes and planes — which is the ability of these tools of the kindergarten trade to withstand punishment meted out by rather tough 6 year olds. Finally, this work acknowledges all trademarks of respective organisations, whose names andor tools have been used in this book. Specifically, I acknowledge the trademarks of Rational (for ROSETM), TogetherSoft (for TogetherControlCenterTM), Object-oriented Pty Ltd (for ProcessMentorTM) and eTrackTM. Critiques It reflects a healthy state of affairs within the IT world, and especially the UML and process community, if work of this nature receives its due share of criticism. All criticisms have an underlying rationale and that they should all be accepted in a positive and constructive vein. All comments on this work, both positive and negative will be accepted positively. Thus, to all my prospective critics, whose criticisms will not only enrich my own knowledge and understanding of the quality topics discussed in this book, but which will also add to the general wealth of knowledge available to the IT community, I wish to say a big thank you in advance.
